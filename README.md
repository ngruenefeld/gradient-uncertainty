<h2>Repository Structure:</h2>

<p>In principle, the python scripts in /scripts/ each cover one experiment and generate its results, which are saved in /data/.</p>
<p>/shell-scripts/ contains shell scripts each corresponding to an experiment python script, which are used to execute the experiment using SLURM.</p>
<p>The experimental results are then analyzed using the Jupyter notebooks in /notebooks/, with the generated figures being saved in /figures/.</p>
<p>The toy experiment experiments are the exception, where the entire experiment is performed in the corresponding notebook (and the resultung models saved in /notebooks/saved_experiments/).</p>
<p>/utils/ contains much of the substantial code used in the experiments.
<ul>
  <li>/utils/utils.py contains the gradient uncertainty method itself as well as the code to load all used datasets from huggingface and some general utility functions.</li>
  <li>/utils/gpt.py contains every usage of GPT, i.e. to rephrase text and evaluate model answers.</li>
</ul>  
</p>
<p>/slurm-outputs/ contains log files generated by SLURM for every run experiment.</p>
<p>requirements.txt contains the required packages to reproduce the experimental data (generally speaking all the python scripts), and requirements_eval.txt contains the required packages for the data analysis (generally speaking all the notebooks, including the toy experiment notebooks).</p>
