Article: Jessica Simpson dazzled in a new image shared on Instagram this week, where she was seen promoting her new collaboration with Walmart.
The fashion-forward entrepreneur and singer, known for her Jessica Simpson Collection, looked stunning in a bright green bikini.
The ensemble showcased Jessica's incredible figure following her notable 100-pound weight loss after the birth of her third child with husband Eric Johnson.
The 43-year-old mother of three styled her hair down, adding a touch of glam with a straw hat and jewelled belt and skirt.
She posed gracefully by the shore, embodying the vibrant spirit of her new collection. "We’re so excited to share our collaboration with @walmart!" Jessica shared in her caption.
"An all-new collection of over 100 pieces across apparel and swimwear (styles you won’t find anywhere else!) and jewelry to help you style a versatile, affordable, easy-to-wear summer wardrobe! Available in sizes XS-4X (apparel) and XXL (swim) at select @walmart stores and online! #WalmartFashion," she enthused about the partnership.
In another heartfelt caption, Jessica described her style for the day as 'Cali boho meets Texas charm.'
The A Public Affair singer's venture with Walmart features an exclusive collection that includes everything from swimwear to everyday apparel, all infused with her signature style.
The promotional video for the collaboration highlights several photoshoots, showcasing the breadth and appeal of the new collection.
Jessica also took a moment to reflect on the mission of her brand, stating, "We can't wait to help even more women feel their absolute best and most confident in what they wear."
Her brand, which launched in 2005 initially focusing on footwear, has since expanded into a full-fledged lifestyle brand embracing clothing and home goods. The transition reflects Jessica's evolving personal style and her deep commitment to accessible fashion.
The entrepreneur, alongside her mother Tina, regained control of the brand in 2021 after its parent company faced financial difficulties.
This move underscored her dedication to her business and her desire to keep her brand closely aligned with her vision and values. Jessica shared with People magazine how she draws design inspiration from various sources, including music, art, and her children. "I get my design inspiration from everywhere, like a song I love or a piece of art. I love vintage fashion, so I am always looking through archival prints and cuts," she explained.
Particularly inspired by her eldest daughter, Maxwell, Jessica admires her unique fashion sense and infectious confidence. "I am very inspired by my daughter Maxwell. Her pulse on fashion is so unique. She is an infectious trendsetter and always effortlessly confident," she proudly stated.
Jessica, who also embraces her role as a mother with fervor, recently spoke about her increased confidence since becoming a parent.
She expressed a newfound appreciation for her body's capabilities, saying, "It wasn't until I became a mother that I learned to celebrate what a woman's body can do. I am more confident now after three kids than I was at 25!"
With her family, including her supportive husband Eric and their three children, Jessica continues to balance her busy life with flair. The couple, who married in 2014, share daughters Maxwell Drew and Birdie Mae, as well as son Ace Knute.
Jessica’s diet secrets
Jessica is believed to have lost around 100lbs. This impressive transformation followed the birth of her third child, Birdie, in 2019. Opening up about her journey, Jessica shared with E! News, “I went to a nutritionist, and I needed to get my eating habits right.”
Earlier this year, she humorously dismissed rumors of using the weight-loss drug Ozempic, reflecting on her body's evolution over the years with Bustle, “I am fortunate to have been every size... For [my] brand, understanding the women [who buy our products] and for my psyche.”

Article: Police surround Columbia University as antiwar protests grow at U.S. campuses
Updated April 30, 2024 at 21:15 PM ET
New York police surrounded Columbia University and activists put out calls for more protestors on social media as the chaotic pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus appeared to reach a turning point late Tuesday.
Protesters have occupied the central campus building of Hamilton Hall for most of Tuesday, after the school asked them to voluntarily disperse from an encampment.
The NYPD, with some officers seen in riot gear and carrying zip tie handcuffs, blocked off sections of Broadway near the Columbia Morningside campus late Tuesday.
Activists asked supporters on social media to "mobilize." And people have shown up. A large crowd of protesters gathered outside of the gates of the campus Tuesday evening.
The tensions are one snapshot of protests erupting at college campuses across the U.S. The students are calling for universities to sell off their investments in companies that have businesses or investments in Israel because of the country's invasion of Gaza.
The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, while Israel says some 1,200 Israelis were killed by Hamas in an assault last October. Israel says Hamas is still holding 133 hostages.
Columbia has started suspending the students who have refused to leave and they now face expulsion.
In announcing the disciplinary actions, the school saidon Tuesday that the protesters "have chosen to escalate to an untenable situation."
Two prominent New York Democrats, U.S. Reps. Jerry Nadler and Adriano Espailla, called on the school to "move quickly and swiftly to remove the students who have engaged in unlawful activity."
They wrote in a shared statement that the students are entitled to free speech, but criticized recent actions of the demonstrations at Columbia.
On the other side of the U.S., students broke into the library at Portland State University in Oregon, triggering a campus-wide shutdown.
Many such demonstrations continue with no end in sight, but administrations at Northwestern University and Brown University managed to strike deals with protesters that included agreements to examine the schools' investments.
Campuses see big protests across the U.S.
In Oregon, Portland State University closed its campus on Tuesday, after demonstrators took over the school's library. The protesters broke into the Branford Price Millar Library during the night, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports.
Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt's office said his position is that "the actions taking place have crossed into criminal behavior, and we will prosecute."
Earlier on Tuesday at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, police arrested demonstrators who refused to shut down a "Gaza Solidarity Encampment" protest that began at the Polk Place quad on campus Friday.
Police detained some 30 protesters and moved them elsewhere on campus, according to student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel, which says six people in the group were arrested. Video posted on Instagram by the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine showed UNC police chief Brian James informing protesters that they were trespassing, as they chanted, "We will not stop, we will not rest."
UNC interim Chancellor Lee Roberts and Provost Christopher Clemens sent a letter early Tuesday ordering protesters to dismantle the camp and leave, threatening arrests and potential expulsion.
On Monday, police arrested nearly 80 people protesting in support of Palestinians at the University of Texas at Austin after demonstrators set up an encampment on the south lawn, according to member station KUT.
"Police and troopers in riot gear surrounded the protesters and made arrests," KUT reports.
UT Austin says that protesters "escalated by becoming physically and verbally combative" when approached, adding that it moved against the encampment because demonstrators' tents violated school rules. The arrests were for trespassing or disorderly conduct, it said.
The Palestine Solidarity Committee in Austin, a group organizing protests, condemned school president Jay Hartzell's administration for "yet again calling police to violently suppress students" — a reference to dozens of arrests made last Wednesday.
Along with its demands related to Israel and the Palestinians, the group says Hartzell — who has Gov. Greg Abbott's support — must resign. The group says it plans to hold another demonstration on Wednesday at noon, local time.
Northwestern and Brown reach agreements with protestors
This week Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and, as of Tuesday, Brown University in Rhode Island reached deals with student protesters to deescalate the demonstrations.
Brown President Christina Paxson shared details on the agreement in a campus-wide message on Tuesday.
"The devastation and loss of life in the Middle East has prompted many to call for meaningful change, while also raising real issues about how best to accomplish this," Paxson wrote. "Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog, debate and listening to each other."
Students of the Brown Divest Coalition set up an unauthorized encampment on the school's College Green on April 24, according to the university. With this new deal to deescalate protests, the students have agreed to end the encampment by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Additionally, they will refrain from any further actions "that would violate Brown's conduct code" through the end of the school year, including Commencement and Reunion Weekend.
In return, the school said it would invite five students to meet with five members of the Corporation of Brown University, the University's governing body that includes a Board of Trustees and a Board of Fellows, in May. The students will be allowed to hold a presentation on why Brown's endowment should divest from "companies enabling and profiting from the genocide in Gaza," the agreement stated.
Paxson said she will also ask the Advisory Committee on University Resources Management, the panel responsible for reviewing whether Brown's business and investment practices follow ethical and moral standards consistent with the school's goals and values, to provide a recommendation on divestment by Sept. 30, which will then be brought to the Corporation for a vote at its October meeting.
Dozens of tents set up by protesters at Northwestern in Evanston have been removed from the school's Deering Meadow, after a pro-Palestinian coalition agreed to a deal with school leaders on Monday.
Under the agreement, the Northwestern Divestment Coalition can continue to organize limited protests through at least June 1. Protesters who aren't affiliated with the school are also barred from participating.
In return, the school agreed to transparency measures around its investments, to give support to Middle Eastern and Muslim students, and to fund the "full cost of attendance for five Palestinian undergraduates" to attend the school for four years, along with two visiting Palestinian faculty for two years.
The university also said it will look to add more support for Jewish students. It called recent reports of antisemitic and anti-Muslim/Palestinian incidents "unacceptable."
The school said its goal was to "ensure that the violence and escalation we have seen elsewhere does not happen here at Northwestern."
Columbia and protesters hit a new impasse on Monday
While demonstrators elsewhere have reached deals with their schools' administrations, campus officials at Columbia have rejected student demands to divest from companies operating in Israel.
So, students entered Hamilton Hall early Tuesday morning, chained and barricaded its doors and have been using a rope system to get supplies from supporters, reported WKCR, the university radio station.
Outside, a crowd cheered as the facade was draped with signs reading "Intifada" and "Hind's Hall" — the latter a reference to Hind Rajab, a young Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza in January.
The university is now under what amounts to a lockdown of the campus in Manhattan's Morningside Heights, with access restricted to essential-service employees and students who live in residential halls on the campus.
"This building has now been liberated," an Instagram account affiliated with the student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest announced as it posted an image of Hamilton Hall, echoing language used during a 1968 protest.
Columbia students protesting racism against Black people and the Vietnam War were occupying Hamilton Hall and other buildings exactly 56 years ago — on April 30, 1968 — when police violently cleared the campus. More than 700 people were arrested and almost 150 people were injured.
The New York Police Department says it has officers stationed outside the university, but not on school grounds.
Tuesday's campus shutdown was mirrored by one at Barnard College, which is closely affiliated with Columbia.
Columbia's leadership has set several deadlines as it seeks to reach an agreement with demonstrators to end the encampment, as the school said it violates school policies and is a threat to campus safety, a disturbance to Jewish students and students trying to study and sleep.
Columbia seeks ways to hold graduation ceremony
Columbia's last day of classes for the spring semester was Monday, marking the start of "reading week," in which students traditionally prepare for looming final exams. Those exams are currently set to begin on Friday, with commencement planned for May 15.
Columbia President Minouche Shafik said on Monday that she wanted the protesters to "disperse voluntarily," urging them to consider that the graduating class of 2024 did not get to have their high school commencement ceremonies in person due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The president also said the school was prepared to allow demonstrations to resume after exams and commencement. But, Shafik added, protesters would need to submit an application at least two days in advance, and protests would be allowed only in designated areas.
Shafik said Columbia has supported protests and vigils that happened earlier in the year, as they were peaceful and didn't disturb campus operations.
But she added the encampment has caused an "unwelcoming environment" and "hostile environment" for Jewish students, and violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws discrimination at schools that receive federal funding.

Article: NEW YORK — (AP) — Large numbers of New York City police officers began entering the Columbia University late Tuesday as dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters remained on the campus.
Shortly before officers entered the campus, the New York Police Department received a notice from Columbia authorizing officers to take action, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to discuss details of the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
After entering the campus, a contingent of police officers approached Hamilton Hall, the administration building that students began occupying in the morning.
Students had defiantly set up tents again after police cleared an encampment at the university on April 18 and arrested more than 100 people. The students had been protesting on the Manhattan campus since the previous day, opposing Israeli military action in Gaza and demanding the school divest from companies they claim are profiting from the conflict.
Protests have spread to campuses from California to Massachusetts as May commencement ceremonies near, putting added pressure on schools to clear protesters.
More than 1,000 protesters have been arrested over the last two weeks on campuses in states including Texas, Utah, Virginia, North Carolina, New Mexico, Connecticut, Louisiana, California and New Jersey, some after violent clashes with police in riot gear.
“Walk away from this situation now and continue your advocacy through other means,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams advised the Columbia protesters on Tuesday afternoon. “This must end now.”
The White House condemned the standoffs at Columbia and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where protesters had occupied two buildings until officers with batons intervened overnight and arrested 25 people. Officials estimated the northern California campus' total damage to be upwards of $1 million.
President Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is “absolutely the wrong approach,” and “not an example of peaceful protest,” said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.
Other colleges have sought to negotiate agreements with the demonstrators in the hopes of having peaceful commencement ceremonies. As cease-fire negotiations appeared to gain steam, it wasn't clear whether those talks would inspire an easing of protests.
Northwestern University notched a rare win when officials said they reached a compromise with students and faculty who represent the majority of protesters on its campus near Chicago to allow peaceful demonstrations through the end of spring classes.
The nationwide campus protests began at Columbia in response to Israel’s offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.
Israel and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.
On Columbia's campus, protesters locked arms early Tuesday and carried furniture and metal barricades to Hamilton Hall, among several buildings that were occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest. Demonstrators called the building Hind's Hall, honoring a young girl who was killed in Gaza under Israeli fire.
The takeover came hours after protesters had shrugged off an earlier ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended — restricted from all academic and recreational spaces, allowed only to enter their residences, and, for seniors, ineligible to graduate.
Mahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator before talks with the administration broke down over the weekend, was among the suspended students. His suspension letter — which he shared with The Associated Press — said he had refused to leave the encampment after prior warnings, but Khalil said he had abided by the university’s demand to vacate the encampment on the campus lawn by the Monday afternoon deadline.
Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement that anyone occupying Hamilton Hall risked being expelled from the university for escalating the protest “to an untenable situation — vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows, and blockading entrances.”
Occupying protesters have insisted they will remain in Hamilton Hall until the university agrees to three demands — divestment, financial transparency and amnesty.
The Columbia University Chapter of the American Association of University Professors said faculty’s efforts to help defuse the situation have been repeatedly ignored by the university’s administration despite school statutes that require consultation. The group warned of potential conflict between police officers nearby and protesters on campus.
“We hold University leadership responsible for the disastrous lapses of judgment that have gotten us to this point,” the chapter said in a statement late Tuesday. “The University President, her senior staff, and the Board of Trustees will bear responsibility for any injuries that may occur during any police action on our campus.”
Ilana Lewkovitch, a self-described “leftist Zionist” student at Columbia, said it’s been hard to concentrate on school for weeks, amid calls for Zionists to die or leave campus. Her exams have been punctuated with chants of “say it loud, say it clear, we want Zionists out of here” in the background, she said.
Lewkovitch, who identifies as Jewish and studied at Columbia’s Tel Aviv campus, said she wished the current pro-Palestinian protests were more open to people like her who criticize Israel’s war policies but believe there should be an Israeli state.
Adams claimed Tuesday that the Columbia protests have been “co-opted by professional outside agitators.” The mayor didn’t provide specific evidence to back up that contention, which was disputed by protest organizers and participants.
NYPD officials made similar claims about “outside agitators” during the huge, grassroots demonstrations against racial injustice that erupted across the city after the death of George Floyd in 2020. In some instances, top police officials falsely labeled peaceful marches organized by well-known neighborhood activists as the work of violent extremists.

Article: Newswise — A new study has found that pancreatic cancer cells are different based on their location in the pancreas, providing new information about tumors that could lead to better targeted treatments.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer, and the diagnosis has dramatically increased over the last decade. It is currently the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women globally and projected to be the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths world-wide by 2030. This increase is due to several factors such as an increase in obesity and diabetes.
Houston Methodist’s section chief of gastrointestinal medical oncology, Dr. Maen Abdelrahim, served as first and concept generating author for the article titled, “Comparative molecular profiling of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the head versus body and tail,” published in NPJ Precision Oncology, an online journal in the Nature family of publications. The research team discovered that the anatomical location of the pancreatic tumor is a contributing factor for the outcomes of systematic therapy interventions.
Abdelrahim and his collaborators established a hypothesis that there is a difference in microenvironments of tumors in the pancreatic head versus the body and tail, particularly the immunotherapy receptors found on each section of the pancreas.
“By focusing on biology around the tumor and taking its location on the pancreas into account we can better evaluate our treatment options,” said Abdelrahim. “Rather than treating patients under the umbrella of pancreatic malignancy, a shift to a tumor location-based model can seriously alter how clinicians set up preliminary treatment plans.”
The team hopes this finding will help clinicians develop a more specific treatment plan and improve patient outcomes.
Abdelrahim’s collaborators on this study were Benjamine A. Weinberg, Adbullah Esmail, Anup Kasi, Nestor F. Esnaola, Joanne Xiu, and Yasmine Baca.
The Cockrell Foundation and Houston Methodist Hospital Foundation support this research.

Article: LOS ANGELES — (AP) — At least 55 people were hurt, two seriously, when a Metro light rail train and a University of Southern California shuttle bus collided Tuesday along a busy thoroughfare in downtown Los Angeles, officials said.
The crash happened shortly before noon along Exposition Boulevard, near the USC campus and Natural History Museum, according to the LA Fire Department.
Two victims were hospitalized with serious injuries and 16 others were transported in fair condition, the department said. Another 37 people were treated at the scene.
Dave Sotero, a spokesperson for LA Metro, said the bus crossed into the path of an E Line train. The light rail line runs from East Los Angeles to downtown Santa Monica mostly along streets, and not all of the crossings have gates.
Genesis Hernandez was transferring from a Metro bus to catch the E Line to Santa Monica, where she attends college when “all of a sudden I just saw a bunch of ambulances going by,” she recalled.
The 19-year-old was able to view the crash scene from a platform at the Expo/Vermont Metro station. “The bus definitely got crunched on its front end,” she said. “The train didn't look too damaged.”
Television news footage showed the left side of the red and white bus smashed against the first car of the train. The front section of the bus had significant damage.
The Starcraft 40-passenger bus was traveling westbound on Exposition Boulevard with only the driver and one passenger aboard when the collision occurred, according to a statement from USC Transportation. The bus driver and passenger were the two most severely injured, according to fire department officials.
There were more than 150 passengers on the Santa Monica-bound Metro train, officials said.
Sotero said the Los Angeles Police Department would be in charge of the investigation.
“Metro offers its sympathy to those injured in the accident,” Sotero said in an email.
Exposition Boulevard was closed in both directions during the initial investigation. Metro said its train service would be limited and buses would be used to get passengers through the crash area.

LINCOLN — Approximately two dozen Nebraska National Guard members will be deployed to Elkhorn to assist with security as early as Wednesday, in the wake of last week’s tornado outbreak.
Gov. Jim Pillen on Tuesday announced that the Guard will assist with neighborhood security after a string of tornadoes ripped through Lancaster, Douglas and Washington Counties, particularly the communities of Waverly, Elkhorn and Bennington. Soldiers will assist with deterring looting and managing heavy vehicle traffic.

At this time, Douglas County officials have requested National Guard personnel only for Elkhorn, though additional requests could be made in the future.
Pillen signed an emergency proclamation Sunday allowing access to the Governor’s Emergency Fund to help communities in the three counties recover from storm damage.
Over the weekend the governor and Adj. Gen. Craig Strong, who oversees the Nebraska National Guard, toured parts of the storm path and witnessed the damage firsthand. At a Monday news conference, Pillen said he and Strong were assessing damages and had not reached a decision on Guard deployment.
“I don’t know that anybody can find the right words to use it, but it’s a war zone,” Pillen said. “The longer it (the tornado) went, the bigger it got and the wider it was.”
The National Weather Service estimated the tornado that hit Elkhorn in western Douglas County, before moving into Washington County, was an EF-3 tornado, with 165 mph peak wind, the highest wind in the EF-3 rating before being classified an EF-4.
The tornado was on the ground for nearly one hour and traveled 31.16 miles, crossing the Missouri River into Harrison County, Iowa. It had a maximum width of 1,600 yards, or 0.9 miles.
Pillen has said the Arbor Day storms destroyed about 450 Nebraska homes and that Nebraska remains in contact with federal partners, including FEMA, for additional assistance.

Article: Newswise — Interdisciplinary researchers in Illinois, the U.S. and around the world can advance their projects with the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology's new Zeiss Xradia 630 Versa micro-CT scanner, the first of its kind with life science applications in the U.S.
Computed tomography, or CT, is an imaging technique that involves capturing a series of cross-sectional X-ray scans of an object or sample — be it a material like concrete or a biological sample like an insect or human body. Stacked on top of one another, the images non-invasively reconstruct the subject in 3D from the inside out. Microscopic computed tomography, or micro-CT, helps researchers reconstruct subjects as tiny and delicate as collagen or insect antennae.
Most micro-CT scanners use only X-rays, which are invisible to the human eye, but Beckman’s new model also incorporates visible through a process called scintillation. The 630 Versa can also scan small subsections of large materials while maintaining a maximum imaging resolution of 40 nanometers, 2,500 times narrower than the width of a human hair.
“With building materials, hairline cracks are the start of where things go catastrophically wrong, and the micro-CT scanner at the Beckman Institute can see those cracks,” said Beckman microscopist T. Josek. “We’re providing the opportunity for researchers at the University of Illinois and beyond to start here and start small — see how a material behaves and what it looks like, and then scale up.”
Researchers can use the compression/tensile stage to stretch, bend and compress their samples while scrutinizing them up close — a technique called in situ mechanical testing. The Versa 630 can also do diffraction contrast tomography, a technique wherein researchers can determine a material’s grain orientation by tracking how X-rays bend as they pass through it.
The scanner was installed in January 2024 and is the first 630 model for life science applications in the U.S. In addition to the Beckman Institute, the Illinois Materials Research Laboratory, The Grainger College of Engineering and the Office for the Vice Chancellor of Research and Innovation committed funds to support its purchase.
The Beckman Microscopy Suite team is focused on finding projects on campus and beyond that might benefit from the Versa 630 and are providing comprehensive trainings for those new to the technology. Carl Zeiss Microscopy, the scanner’s manufacturer, is integral to these efforts.
"We at ZEISS are thrilled to be partnering with the Beckman Institute Microscopy Suite to deliver this flexible and intuitive system for X-ray microscopy," said Aubrey Funke, Carl Zeiss Microscopy Product Marketing Manager for Life Science EM/XRM. "The ability to image your sample, be it organic or material, becomes a less intimidating process on the ZEISS Xradia Versa 630. With high powered-resolution and expanded ease-of-use for all skill levels, the Versa 630 is ideal for diverse research capabilities across a spectrum of applications, including life science, electronics, materials research, and many more. We look forward to working with the Beckman Institute Microscopy Suite to support many diverse research projects.”
Researchers at the University of Illinois and beyond are encouraged to use the 630 Versa micro-CT scanner. For more information or to use the micro-CT scanner, please visit the Beckman Institute Microscopy Suite website at https://itg.beckman.illinois.edu/microscopy_suite.

Article: The Dallas Cowboys finally got a veteran contract done. Just not any of the ones who are truly pressing.
In the realm of unfinished business for the franchise, that's right about where Monday's one-year deal for running back Ezekiel Elliott registers. It's a blip on the priority scale, adding a modestly reliable deck chair to a ship that has spent the majority of the offseason sinking. And all of this in the backdrop of team owner Jerry Jones' now infamous "all in" proclamation. Precisely how "all in" have the Cowboys been? Well, let's survey.
The head coach, Mike McCarthy, is entering the final year of his contract. It's a season that will feature Jerry's buddy, Bill Belichick, vulturing from the sideline as he looks for a "win now" opportunity in 2025.
The franchise quarterback, Dak Prescott, has no contract extension in sight and is now subject to endless offseason debates about his level of importance to the team.
The top-five wideout, CeeDee Lamb, is seeing a steep price tag become more justifiable by the month, leading to a legitimate question about why the Cowboys didn’t push harder to extend his deal one year ago.
And the best defensive player on the team, Micah Parsons … re-read the above paragraph about Lamb and apply it to next offseason, when we’ll likely be asking why Dallas didn’t get Parsons' deal done one year earlier rather than one year later.
That’s a lot of unfinished business for Dallas, an assembly line of loose ends that easily dwarfs the looming problems of every other team in the NFL. And it’s coming in an offseason when the franchise’s talent has gotten worse.
The offensive line? Younger but not necessarily better.
The running backs? A rotation without a dynamic player.
The wideouts? Less depth.
The defense? Lost the best assistant coach on the staff in coordinator Dan Quinn and watched DeMarcus Lawrence get another year older.
Lest we forget, this all comes amid smaller headlines that should also convey concerns, like the fact that Parsons and Lamb skipped voluntary workouts at the team’s facility this offseason.
Piece it all together and it doesn't necessitate stepping back to understand the larger picture: The Cowboys are at a critical juncture in almost every imaginable way. The franchise could conceivably have a new head coach and new starting quarterback one year from now. Few NFL franchises find themselves in that kind of position and don't slip into some phase of a rebuild.
All of which makes it important that Dallas gets something — anything — of consequence done in the next few months. The top of the list will be Lamb’s extension, which is trending toward making him the highest paid wide receiver in the NFL for at least a short time. Next up will be finding some common ground with Prescott, although as of this week, there was no progress on any new contract with him. But knowing where Prescott stands would go a long way in shaping up a timeframe with Parsons, too. Particularly if Prescott appears destined to test free agency next offseason, which would all but assure he will depart Dallas.
Unquestionably, this is the biggest slate of unfinished business in the league. And the answers promise to shape the Cowboys for at least the next half decade.
As for the rest of the NFL, here are the biggest remaining storylines as we head toward the summer …
Multiple $50 million (plus) per season QB extensions are simmering
Prescott isn’t the only quarterback with an extension that needs to be hammered out. Four other key deals are hanging in the balance, including the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Trevor Lawrence, Detroit Lions’ Jared Goff, Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa, and Green Bay Packers’ Jordan Love. Here’s a snapshot of what is going on with each:
Lawrence's reps and the Jaguars are in talks. He had his fifth-year option picked up this week, officially giving the Jaguars control through the 2025 season, at which point they could begin utilizing franchise tags to keep him in the fold through at least 2027. That's not the plan. Lawrence has been reticent to push it publicly, but he and his representatives would like to get his deal done this offseason — as would the Jaguars. The numbers here will be key. There is no longer a presumption that Lawrence is a lock to sign a deal making him the highest paid player in the NFL, particularly after his injuries and struggles last season. It's worth noting that Lawrence has a league-worst 60 turnovers over the past three seasons. While those aren't all his fault, it's a troubling issue when focused through the context of his rollback in 2023. When you talk to contract evaluators on both the agent and team side, Lawrence appears to slot at the edge of the top five, with his extension somewhere in the neighborhood of the five-year, $255 million pact signed by Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts in 2023. That would put Lawrence's annual average value at $51 million, which is a sweet spot that factors in some projection of a higher ceiling still to come. One thing I want to make clear here: Not all agents are buying this. More than one agent shared the opinion that Lawrence's negotiation should begin with him setting a contract record at quarterback and work from there. That's largely due to his standing as the centerpiece of the franchise and the team's No. 1 overall draft pick in 2021. It's an interesting argument that might foreshadow some sticky negotiations. Whatever the case, if and when the deal gets done, the target is going to be July, prior to training camp.
Goff and the Lions are in talks, but nothing is particularly close at this point. This one is going to be interesting — to the point that it’s possible Goff plays out his deal in 2024 and the Lions apply the franchise tag to him in 2025. That being an option isn’t a signal Detroit is taking a soft approach to commitment. It’s more a matter of the two sides finding the right intersection that recognizes Goff’s success versus where he stacks up with other QBs inside the top 10 contracts at the position. One agent who has done multiple high-end deals, including at quarterback, pointed to the four-year $180 million deal Kirk Cousins signed with Atlanta as a starting point that would need a solid premium added that's reflective of Goff’s hand in last season’s NFC title game run. That premium should put Goff solidly north of Cousins and Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, tipping his average annual salary over the $50 million mark, with two full years of guaranteed money and a partial guarantee into Year 3 of the deal. If it’s less than that, Goff is giving the Lions a hometown discount.
Following the completion of the draft, Tagovailoa’s extension is now at the top of the priority list for the Dolphins. The heavy lifting hasn’t started in talks, but it’s expected to ramp up quickly. Contract evaluators believe the Cousins deal in Atlanta, plus a solid premium due to Tua’s age, provides a set of guardrails in negotiations. The question here will be the number of years and where the guarantees fall — as well as whether those guarantees stretch into a third year. It’s clear Miami is set on getting this one done by training camp. Like Goff, peg Tagovailoa’s deal as being in the neighborhood of $50 million-plus per season, reflecting the salary cap increasing at a higher than anticipated rate.
Due to the CBA’s contract guidelines, Love and the Packers aren’t actually eligible to sign an extension until Friday, due to the deal he signed last offseason not having been on the books for a full year yet and also having a slew of void years attached to it. Now that the draft is in the books and the calendar is turning to May, the two sides can run headlong into hammering an extension out. The floor on this one is going to be significant. With Love’s predecessor Aaron Rodgers departing with a final season salary north of $50 million, that number is expected to be the starting point for Love’s annual average value. You should be noticing a trend here with that $50-million-per-season shelf. If a quarterback is considered to be inside or near the top 10 in the league — or is young with modest success and high remaining upside — agents are aiming for that $50 million mark as a floor. Love will be no different. A franchise tag here isn’t out of the question, given that Love still has a limited track record of success. It should be noted that if a tag is used and Love’s second-half of 2023 materializes as his performance level in 2024, the next round of negotiations after 2024 will be for a deal that makes him the highest paid player in the NFL.
Winds of change in San Francisco
It didn’t happen before or during the NFL Draft, but you can see the setup coming for the 49ers: One of their top two wideouts isn’t likely to be on this team after the 2024 season.
With Brandon Aiyuk playing on his fifth-year option and Deebo Samuel nearing a manageable trapdoor exit in his contract next offseason, you can see where this is going. Particularly after San Francisco drafted wideout Ricky Pearsall in the first round and Jacob Cowing in the fourth last week. The question now becomes “who” between that pair of Aiyuk and Samuel.
Given the level of punishment Samuel has taken over the course of his career and Aiyuk being the younger player who is now ascending into his prime, Samuel would appear to be the player who is made available next offseason … or potentially even into training camp. It's something to keep an eye on in the interim: Whether Aiyuk reports for mandatory minicamp in June, which could foreshadow a holdout (or hold in) during training camp.
A pair of wideout holdouts?
Like Aiyuk, eyes will be on Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson and Cincinnati Bengals wideout Tee Higgins. Jefferson is awaiting a monster contract extension that a few people inside the franchise believe should have been a bigger priority (and also gotten done) last offseason. One year later, the numbers have moved into the territory of Jefferson becoming the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history. That expectation didn’t lessen after the draft, with the Vikings needing their best offensive weapon on the field to help along the development of rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy. If there’s not progress on getting this deal done, it would not be a surprise to see Jefferson skip the team’s mandatory minicamp and then engage in a hold-in come training camp.
Higgins, on the other hand, didn’t have anything close to what his camp believed was a suitable contract extension offer prior to the Bengals applying the franchise tag to him. That makes it far less likely that even some significant holdout pressure could result in a deal getting done. If anything, a holdout by Higgins in mandatory minicamp and into training camp would be geared toward forcing a trade. Right now, the Bengals don’t have plans to make that kind of move. That means either Higgins shows up and plays out the tag, or digs in and creates enough of a scene to force a trade that appears very unlikely.
The Rashee Rice suspension
Rice will eventually be suspended by the NFL for a violation of the personal conduct policy, triggered by his road racing crash in Dallas earlier this offseason. That is not in dispute. The question is what the length of suspension will be and when it will happen. And that is entirely in the hands of the legal process.
Rice is facing eight felony counts related to the incident — one count of collision involving serious bodily injury, one count of aggravated assault, and six counts of collision involving injury. Of the eight counts, the most serious from a legal standing, is the charge tied to aggravated assault.
The presumption is that Rice’s legal team will eventually seek a plea deal that could ultimately be aided by any compensation he provides to the crash victims. The important part to understand here is that the legal process is just getting underway and could take months if not longer to snake toward some manner of trial. Delays in that process, which also always come into play, could push a resolution all the way into 2025.
That means Rice may not face any NFL discipline this season.
That said, it’s coming down the pipeline, with the measure of severity expected to be impacted by whatever comes out of the legal process and any measures that Rice and his legal team use to resolve his charges.

Several Utah representatives introduced legislation last week to withdraw a proposed rule from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that the agency says would promote conservation through the protection and restoration of certain landscapes, but that opponents say would stop state-level management of public lands and block land from important uses.
Reps. John Curtis, Celeste Maloy, Blake Moore and Burgess Owens and nine other members of Congress’ Western Caucus sponsored legislation to withdraw the rule, alleging it would limit access to public lands. The rule, titled “Conservation and Landscape Health,” was introduced in March and purportedly “lays groundwork for conserving wildlife habitat, restoring places impacted by wildfire and drought, expanding outdoor recreation, and thoughtful development,” according to an Interior Department press release.
Gov. Spencer Cox and several other governors have said they plan to sue the federal government over the new rule.
The sponsors of last week’s legislation said the BLM’s rule would have a disproportionate effect on Western states and citizens, as more than 90 percent of the 245 million acres controlled by the BLM are located in the West.
Curtis spoke about the bill on the House floor, where he spoke about Utah’s rural communities, and how they “work hard to feed our families, protect American energy, and lead in manufacturing.”
“We should be making it easier for them,” he continued. “Instead, the Biden administration is pushing this rule to allow environmental groups funded by Swiss billionaires who pretend to be representing Utah to lock up public lands. This is completely backwards… .”
Curtis said the new rule favors “wealthy individuals and environmental groups, allowing them to lock up land that belongs to all Utahns. I am pleased that the House voted in a bipartisan manner to pass my bill revoking its implementation.”
The rule proposes a number of regulations under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), including allowing environmental groups to lease land to close it off to other uses.
“The proposal is consistent with strategies used by other state and federal land management agencies to ensure the federal government has tools and direction to identify areas in need of restoration or conservation, as well as the ability to encourage investments in public lands to help balance the impacts of development,” the Interior Department press release states.
Although the release also claimed the rule would “increase access to outdoor education by putting conservation on equal footing with other uses,” the Western Caucus sponsors claimed it would actually limit recreational opportunities, as well as hinder access for energy and mineral development, grazing and forest management.
“In the West, we know locking up lands with preservationist designations does not automatically guarantee healthy landscapes. In fact, the opposite is often the case,” said Western Caucus Chairman Dan Newhouse. “Farmers and ranchers are the best stewards of the land, not bureaucrats in Washington who seek to hamper our land managers’ ability to conserve the land they rely on for their livelihoods.”

Article: If you were curious about what exactly happened to Shohei Ohtani's money after it was allegedly stolen by his former interpreter Ippei Mizuhara, a new report from ESPN's Tisha Thompson has shed new light on the situation.
The man at the center of the alleged illegal gambling ring that received Ohtani's money was run by a man named Mathew Bowyer, who has been under investigation by federal authorities since last year. Ohtani was only roped into the scandal when authorities noticed his bank information among the payments to Bowyer.
Mizuhara reportedly funneled weekly $500,000 payments from Ohtani's bank account to an associate of Bowyer's to cover his illegal gambling losses. ESPN reports that associate would then deposit the money into accounts with Resorts World, a Las Vegas casino opened in 2021, and Pechanga Resort Casinoi in Temecula, Calif.
Bowyer and the associate would then allegedly convert the money to playing chips, gamble with it and cash out if they won. Bowyer reportedly lost $7.9 million at Resorts World from June 22 to Oct. 2023, a span of time in which he was receiving money from Mizuhara.
This is all apparently part of a much larger trend in the gambling world, where illegal bookies in Southern California use Las Vegas casinos to launder the money. Twelve people have reportedly been charged and convicted while two Vegas casinos have agreed to pay fines.
There's even a tangential connection to LeBron James. The Los Angeles Lakers star's friend and business partner Maverick Carter reportedly admitted late last year that he bet on NBA games via an illegal bookie. ESPN reports that bookie, Wayne Nix, has since pleaded guilty to operating an illegal gambling business and filing a false tax return. NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen and former MLB star Yasiel Puig also reportedly made bets through Nix.
In the case of Bowyer, he reportedly boasted more than 600 bettors and was known as a whale in Vegas, with a reputation for bringing between $250,000 and $1 million with him as often as two or three times a month.
Where does the Shohei Ohtani scandal currently stand?
As far as Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers and MLB, the Ippei Mizuhara situation is in the rear-view mirror.
Mizuhara turned himself in on a federal charge of bank fraud earlier this month and is currently out on $25,000 bond. His attorney released a statement soon after indicating a desire to cut a deal with prosecutors rather than go to trial, where he would face up to 30 years in prison:
Today Mr. Mizuhara voluntarily surrendered, made his initial appearance, and was released on bond as agreed to with the government. He is continuing to cooperate with the legal process and is hopeful that he can reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.
He wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family. As noted in court, he is also eager to seek treatment for his gambling. We have no further comment at this time, but Mr. Mizuhara will be providing further comment as the legal process proceeds.
To date, no reports of a deal have materialized, but that doesn't mean negotiations aren't happening.
Meanwhile, MLB has released a statement recognizing that authorities see Ohtani as a victim, leaving them little to investigate.
This is about as good an outcome that Ohtani and his people could have hoped for after his name popped up on an illegal bookie's ledger, but remains a very sad situation. It's become clear that Mizuhara was both very close to Ohtani and suffered from enormous issues with gambling addiction.
Now, Ohtani is just focusing on baseball again, while Mizuhara is sorting out an unenviable legal situation.

Article: 7-DAY DEADLINE ALERT: The Schall Law Firm Encourages Investors in iRobot Corporation with Losses of $100,000 to Contact the Firm
LOS ANGELES, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Schall Law Firm, a national shareholder rights litigation firm, reminds investors of a class action lawsuit against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) for violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Investors who purchased the Company’s securities between August 5, 2022 and January 26, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), are encouraged to contact the firm before May 7, 2024.
If you are a shareholder who suffered a loss, click here to participate.
We also encourage you to contact Brian Schall of the Schall Law Firm, 2049 Century Park East, Suite 2460, Los Angeles, CA 90067, at 310-301-3335, to discuss your rights free of charge. You can also reach us through the firm's website at www.schallfirm.com, or by email at bschall@schallfirm.com.
The class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.
According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. iRobot’s merger with Amazon (“the Merger”) would give Amazon a dominant position in robot vacuum cleaners (“RVCs”), making it unlikely that American and European authorities would approve it. The Company failed to complete adequate due diligence on the Merger and ignored regulatory risks. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about iRobot, investors suffered damages.
Join the case to recover your losses.
The Schall Law Firm represents investors around the world and specializes in securities class action lawsuits and shareholder rights litigation.

Matt Harmon and Andy Behrens go where no pod has gone before after the NFL Draft. They identify the biggest winners and losers in the fantasy world. This is totally an original idea so don't fact check us. Behrens also reveals the four biggest debates he had when putting together his rookie dynasty rankings.
To start the show, Behrens shares his thoughts on the Bears dynamic draft that saw them snag Caleb Williams and Rome Odunze in the first and the Iowa punter in the fourth round. Being a Hawkeye alum, Behrens is over the moon with the Bears selections and is counting down the days to a Super Bowl parade.
The two then share, secret list style, their three biggest winners and losers from this year's NFL Draft with a focus on players that will now have to face competition from rookie teammates and those are look like they are in the clear for tons of volume. Both agree Las Vegas Raiders RB Zamir White might be the biggest winner of the draft while his new teammate Brock Bowers might be the biggest loser.
To end the show, Behrens shares the four biggest debates he had with himself when putting together his rookie dynasty rankings. Harmon and Behrens discuss the biggest hot button debates that will dominate dynasty rookie drafts this summer.

Article: Newswise — The border crossing separating San Diego, California, from Tijuana, Mexico, is a dynamic place. When it was closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, drug tourism from San Diego to Tijuana continued. This provided a flow of people in both directions, bringing with them not only the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) but also the virus that causes AIDS (HIV). A collaborative study led by researchers from University of California San Diego and Irvine, recently published in the Lancet, found that rather than preventing the spread of disease, closing the border actually increased the rate of HIV transmission.
Injection drug use increases the risk of HIV infection through the sharing of injection equipment. To investigate the dynamics between border closure, drug use and HIV transmission, Britt Skaathun, Ph.D., adjunct assistant professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine, and first author on the paper, led an effort that studied 618 participants from October 2020 to October 2021, focusing on three different groups: people who live in San Diego who cross the border to use drugs in Tijuana; people who live in San Diego and use drugs in San Diego; and people who live in Tijuana and use drugs in Tijuana.
Subjects first underwent interviews, answering questions about their demographics, drug use behaviors, sexual behaviors, sexual identity and border crossing behaviors. Every six months they gave blood samples and were tested for HIV and hepatitis C.
Tetyana Vasylyeva, D.Phil., assistant professor of population health and disease prevention at UC Irvine, and senior author on the study, analyzed the spread of HIV through the virus genetic data. Combining molecular epidemiology with the questionnaire answers, the scientists found that people were crossing the border in both directions and being exposed to HIV despite government efforts to keep the border closed. The scientists then deepened their analysis by applying advanced molecular techniques.
For every patient who tested HIV positive, Vasylyeva and her colleagues isolated the virus, sequenced its RNA and analyzed the genetic diversity in the border region. They investigated how closely the viruses were related genetically—a field of study called phylogenetics, in which scientists construct trees representing how viruses relate to each other.
After constructing viral phylogenetic trees, the scientists subjected them to a molecular clock analysis. Molecular clock is based on a theory that assumes organisms evolve with a relatively constant rate over time. In this case, applying the molecular clock to the phylogenetic trees enabled the scientists to estimate the timing of cross-border HIV transmission. That further enabled them to identify transmission clusters. “If two or three people have viruses that are very similar to each other, we can assume that the transmission event happened more recently, because there is not enough evolution between these different viruses from these different people,” explained Vasylyeva.
The next step was to combine the survey data and the phylodynamic data. They found that during the 18-month period of their study, nine people contracted HIV, mostly during the pandemic. “Nine sounds like a small number, but it's actually quite a lot of people because in the U.S., HIV incidence is relatively low. We were surprised to see this change in HIV status in such a short amount of time and wanted to look more closely at these clusters,” said Skaathun.
Applying a molecular clock to the clusters, they found a surprise: all of the new clusters had sequences from participants on both sides of the border, indicating that cross-border transmission was happening right when the border was closed. One cluster that grew despite the border closure included two people from San Diego that used drugs in Tijuana. “This shows that efforts to build a higher wall or policies to stop immigration will not mitigate HIV spread,” said Vasylyeva.
Structural risk is a social factor that increases harm. Skaathun says the current study shows that closing the border during the pandemic functioned as a structural risk factor. “The Frontera [border] is one integrated community that is not defined by place of residence. Efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S. also need to be integrated by extending to Tijuana,” she said.
In 2000, the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission was founded to “provide international leadership to improve health and quality of life along the U.S.-Mexico border.” Gudelia Rangel, Ph.D., serves as executive secretary for the commission. Rangel is also a co-author on the current study. “These findings confirm that HIV has no passport,” she says. Like her colleagues, she believes that establishing programs to eliminate HIV transmission at the border, such as harm reduction and substance use treatment services, is a more effective way of preventing viral spread than attempting to close a porous border.

Article: The Chicago area is likely going to escape the brunt of a system bringing strong-to-severe thunderstorms to the Great Plains on Tuesday, but pockets of gusty winds could cause tree damage, according to the National Weather Service.
That system has already sparked tornado watches in parts of Iowa and Missouri, with gusty winds and heavy rain also possible with those storms as they push toward the southeast.
As the midnight hour approaches, that system is expected to approach the Chicago area, but the storms are expected to dissipate, leaving only a chance for scattered showers if any precipitation does fall.
The threat of wind will still be present however, with wind gusts of 30-to-40 miles per hour possible overnight, according to NWS officials. “Isolated corridors” of high winds could also occur, with some gusts even exceeding 50 miles per hour.
Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.
Wind gusts of that speed have the potential to cause damage to trees and to power lines, with officials warning residents to be wary of the changing conditions between midnight and 4 a.m.
Breezy conditions are expected to persist in the area for several days, but conditions are expected to remain mostly dry on Wednesday and for most of Thursday, with several chances of rain impacting the area as the weekend approaches.
Stay tuned to the NBC 5 Storm Team for all the latest weather news and information.

Article: Newswise — LOS ANGELES (April 30, 2024) -- Artificial intelligence experts at Cedars-Sinai and the Smidt Heart Institute created a dataset with more than 1 million echocardiograms, or cardiac ultrasound videos, and their corresponding clinical interpretations. Using this database, they created EchoCLIP, a powerful machine learning algorithm that can “interpret” echocardiogram images and assess key findings.
The design and evaluation of EchoCLIP, described in a manuscript published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine, suggest that an EchoCLIP interpretation of a patient’s echocardiogram provides clinician-level evaluations of heart function, assessment of past surgeries and devices, and may assist clinicians in identifying patients in need of treatment. The EchoCLIP foundation model also can identify the same patient across multiple videos, studies and timepoints as well as recognize clinically important changes in a patient’s heart.
“To our knowledge, this is the largest model trained on echocardiography images,” said corresponding author David Ouyang, MD, a faculty member in the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute and in the Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine. “Many previous AI models for echocardiograms are only trained on tens of thousands of examples. In contrast, EchoCLIP’s uniquely strong performance in image interpretation is a result of its training on almost tenfold more data than existing models.”
“Our results suggest that large datasets of medical imaging and expert-adjudicated interpretations can serve as the basis for training medical foundation models, which are a form of generative artificial intelligence,” Ouyang said. He said this advanced foundation model can soon help cardiologists in the assessment of echocardiograms by generating preliminary assessments of cardiac measurements, identify changes that happen over time, and common disease states.
The team of investigators built a dataset of 1,032,975 cardiac ultrasound videos and corresponding expert interpretations to develop EchoCLIP. Key takeaways from the study include:
- EchoCLIP displayed strong performance when assessing cardiac function using heart images.
- The foundation model could identify implanted intracardiac devices like a pacemaker, implanted mitral valve repairs and aortic valves from the echocardiogram images.
- EchoCLIP accurately identified unique patients across studies, identified clinically important changes such as having undergone heart surgery, and enabled the development of a preliminary text interpretation of echocardiogram images.
“Foundation models are one of the newest areas within generative AI, but most models do not have enough medical data to be useful in the healthcare arena,” said Christine M.

Article: Jack Flaherty had a perfect start against his former team on Tuesday afternoon.
The Detroit Tigers pitcher matched an American League Record at Comerica Park when he recorded seven straight strikeouts to open their game against the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday.
By the time Flaherty was pulled from the mound in the seventh inning, he had a career-high 14 strikeouts. That matched Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow for the most thrown in a single game in the league this season, and the most thrown by a Tigers starter in a game in nearly a decade.
Only four other American League pitchers have struck out seven batters in a row to open a game. Luis Castillo was the most recent pitcher to pull that off in 2022. Miami Marlins pitcher Pablo Lopez holds the league record with nine.
"It was nice to come out and be in sync from pitch one," Flaherty said, via The Associated Press.
Despite Flaherty’s career day, the Cardinals rallied in the ninth behind RBIs from Alec Burleson and Pedro Pagés to pick up the 2-1 win.
Flaherty signed a one-year, $14 million deal with the Tigers this past offseason after spending most of his career with the Cardinals — who selected him in the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft. He made his debut with the club in 2017, and spent more than six seasons there before he was dealt to the Baltimore Orioles there. He went 8-9 with a 4.99 ERA in 27 starts last season.
The 28-year-old has yet to pick up a win in his six starts with the Tigers, but he has 50 strikeouts and five walks over 36 innings on the mound.
"He was on, and it was nasty," Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said, via The Associated Press. "He had his stuff."
The loss dropped the Tigers to 16-13 on the season, and marked their third loss in their last five outings. The Tigers and Cardinals, who ran it back immediately on Tuesday for a doubleheader after Monday’s contest was postponed, will wrap up their three-game series on Wednesday afternoon.

Rep. Shri Thanedar's campaign is alleging one of his most significant primary challengers failed to submit enough valid petition signatures to appear on the Democratic primary ballot for Michigan's 13th Congressional District this August.
In a news release sent Tuesday evening, the Democratic congressman from Detroit's reelection campaign says it's challenging the petition signatures submitted by Adam Hollier, a former state senator who finished second to Thanedar in the Aug. 2022 primary for the 13th District. Hollier, however, told the Free Press Thanedar is attempting to disenfranchise voters and is using "legal tricks" to keep him off the ballot.
Thanedar's campaign says it's challenging 791 of the approximately 1,555 signatures submitted by Hollier's campaign. It alleges several reasons why the signatures shouldn't be accepted, including potential duplicate signatures, signatures from voters registered outside the 13th District, signatures from people not registered to vote or registered at wrong addresses and potentially forged signatures.
"Some of the signatures, the handwriting, look like just one person doing it all," Thanedar said in a Tuesday interview. "It just looks, in general, like the quality of the work seems questionable."
Longtime Michigan political consultant Mark Grebner reviewed the signatures at Thanedar's request, according to an affidavit submitted by his campaign.
Thanedar's campaign says it's asked the Wayne County Clerk's office to investigate the signatures. Ultimately, it's the Board of State Canvassers that will determine who appears on the August primary ballot.
If the signature challenge is unsuccessful and Hollier ends up on the primary ballot, Thanedar said "(w)e'll be happy to engage and show the voters the work that I have done in the job for nearly a year and a half now."
The 13th District covers part of Detroit, several Downriver communities and most of the Grosse Pointe communities. Its heavily Democratic lean makes the primary extremely competitive.
Hollier is one of four primary challengers vying to oust Thanedar after a single term, in a field that also includes Detroit City Councilwoman Mary Waters. He received the second-most votes among five Democratic candidates in the 2022 primary, receiving nearly 3,800, or almost 5%, fewer votes than Thanedar.
He's touted several notable endorsements, including from Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and former U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, among others. Hollier said he ultimately believes he will end up on the primary ballot, despite Thanedar's challenge.
"I think Detroiters and people in the 13th Congressional District should be deeply frustrated that their Congressmember is trying to disenfranchise their ability to vote," Hollier said.
Along with Hollier and Waters, attorney Shakira Lynn Hawkins is running in the Democratic primary to challenge Thanedar, according to the Secretary of State's office.

Article: One of only two World Tour races in Germany, the Eschborn-Frankfurt is sticking to the course used last year set over more than 200km with two climbs of the Feldberg and three of the Mammolshainer Stich. It is officially the final classic race of the Spring so read on and we'll show you how to watch Eschborn-Frankfurt 2024 live streams from anywhere with a VPN, and potentially for FREE.
The 61st edition of this classic German race is held in and to the north west of Frankfurt. It compromises multiple laps of a series of loops around the outskirts of the city. Dominated by two climbs, the first of which is the 11km Feldberg, set on an average gradient of 4.8%, and that is followed 50km later by twin ascents of the shorter but much steeper 2.3km Mammolshain climb.
After, this the race returns once more to the slopes of the Feldberg before a final ascent of the Mammolshain some 40km from the finish line. This large distance to the end should allow gapped riders to re-join the front of the race and form a small group to fight out a sprint finish.
The key protagonists this year are going to be March Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates), Maximilian Schachmann and Emil Herzog both (BORA - hansgrohe), Mathias Vacek (Lidl - Trek) and Laurenz Rex (Intermarché - Wanty).

Article: BUFFALO, N.Y. — (AP) — Democratic state Sen. Timothy Kennedy won a special election Tuesday for the New York congressional seat vacated by Democrat Brian Higgins.
Kennedy defeated Republican Gary Dickson for the upstate New York seat, helped by a 2-to-1 Democratic registration advantage in the district, which includes Buffalo, Niagara Falls and several suburbs.
Kennedy has been in the state Senate since 2011. Describing Washington as "chaotic and dysfunctional," he said he would focus in Congress on reproductive rights, immigration and stronger gun laws like those passed in New York after a 2022 mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket.
“New York has been a bulwark against Donald Trump’s extremist MAGA agenda that has infected our politics and our nation’s capital,” he said during the campaign. “The MAGA extremists have made the House of Representatives a laughingstock.”
Registration wasn't Kennedy's only advantage. The Democrat raised $1.7 million as of April 10, compared with Dickson's $35,430 total, according to campaign finance reports. Kennedy spent just over $1 million in the off-season election, compared with $21,000 for Dickson as the candidates worked to remind voters to go to the polls.
Kennedy will serve in Congress for the rest of the year. He is on the ballot, along with Republican attorney Anthony Marecki, for the general election. On Tuesday, former town supervisor Nate McMurray, who planned to challenge Kennedy in a Democratic primary in June, said in a social media post that elections officials had removed him from the ballot because of insufficient signatures.
Earlier this year, the GOP's slim House majority was narrowed in a closely contested Long Island-area special election that followed New York Republican George Santos' expulsion from Congress. That race, won by Democrat Tom Suozzi, was viewed as a test of the parties' general election strategies on immigration and abortion.
Dickson, a retired FBI special agent, acknowledged the challenges of running in the upstate district when he announced his candidacy at the end of February, saying he was in the race to give voters a choice. He said he supports Trump as the Republican nominee for president, while describing his own politics as “more towards the center.”

Article: Apr. 30—Ector County ISD's Special Services Department is facing a lot of challenges from trying to clear up a backlog of referrals to the way it handles discipline.
At a recent ECISD Board of Trustees workshop, the board discussed discipline for multi-racial special education students. This is called significant disproportionality. Mark Gabrylczyk, executive director of special services, said they went over the risk ratio for discipline of a population of ECISD students compared to other students in the district.
When a district goes over the risk ratio, the state tells them they are being flagged for a disproportionality issue. The district has three years to fix it. If a district has three continual years of significant disproportionality, which ECISD has, the state puts the program in Targeted Assistance.
Gabrylczyk now has a meeting with the Texas Education Agency once a month to talk about how they are going to improve the risk ratio within that group of students. TEA had Gabrylczyk put together a plan that includes professional development for administrators and teachers where certain milestones have to be met.
"In addition, there's a financial element to it. The state is going to take 15 percent of the special education budget and it is now being allotted to fixing the issue of significant disproportionality. So 15 percent of the special education budget is significant in our case because it's close to $1 million. That $1 million needs to be spent on fixing that issue instead of being reinvested into another strategy or project that we need to tackle. So it's a big deal," he added.
The special education budget is about $6 million and it is separate from the general fund. It is made up of state and federal funds, which is "very controlled by the state, which is very controlled by the federal government," Gabrylczyk said. They have to use all 15 percent to fix the risk ratio.
He added that special education is very regulated and it's a complex part of the district.
"Because you're dealing with legal issues, you're dealing with financial issues, you're dealing with programming issues, you're dealing with eligibility issues. On top of that, you're dealing with kids who may have a learning disability to kids who are medically fragile," Gabrylczyk said.
Special Services also faces a backlog of evaluations. Gabrylczyk said they started the year with a carryover of 706 evaluations from last year. That didn't include any new evaluations that they were getting for this school year.
"This school year ... to date, we have received 726 new referrals. When we combine the carryover with the new referrals, we're sitting at over 1,400 referrals that we need to get done," Gabrylczyk said.
They have 570 referrals that had been completed and 436 referrals that are currently being evaluated. That means that the diagnostician, licensed specialist in school psychology, or the speech pathologist has the file folder and they've started the evaluation process, he said.
They have 900 of the 1,400 evaluations done. They have 21 diagnosticians, some of whom work virtually for the district, the others work on ECISD campuses. They have one licensed specialist in school psychology currently,
"Yes, we've done a lot of work in this area, but we still have a lot of work to do," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that the evaluation process takes a long time.
"When we receive a referral, we have 15 days to determine whether or not we're going to evaluate a student. If we decide to evaluate the student, we move forward with the evaluation and getting the consent signed to evaluate the student. If we decide not to evaluate the student, we inform the parents that we're not going to evaluate the student. So there's a 15-day window that we have for parents," Gabrylczyk said.
Special Education Supervisor Amanda Napolean said when a parent requests an evaluation, they have 15 school days to offer consent or decline to evaluate.
They have 45 school days to complete the evaluation and get the report written. They have 30 calendar days to meet on the results of the evaluation, Napolean said.
Gabrylczyk said they will be conducting evaluations over the summer. Napolean said they did them over spring break. The office was open for nine days, including weekends.
The state recently changed eligibility requirements for special education in the area of dyslexia, behavior and autism.
"It's a huge increase to what has been done in the past, not only in our school district but also throughout of the state of Texas," Gabrylczyk said.
Special Services has a process it uses to determine if students are eligible for special education.
"For example we will look at attendance, does the student have attendance issues? What are the student's academic strengths and what are their academic concerns? This is where the teacher will provide us information," Gabrylczyk said.
"We look at their MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) scores, which is really, really important. We look at their STAAR results, which is really, really important. We also look at their basic reading, math, spelling and writing scores on assessments that we give our kids. Are they weak or are they really strong?" he added.
They use a scale of 1 to 4 with 4 being the strongest and one the weakest.
"We look at for an example if the student is bilingual, or multilingual, we look at their TELPAS scores. We want to make sure that we're making consideration for both English and the Spanish language. We look at their vision screens. We look at their hearing screens. If it's a student who needs physical therapy or occupational therapy, we will go ahead and look at that," Gabrylczyk said.
"In the areas of speech, we look at their language fluency, their articulation, and also their voice," he added.
Schools use Mult-tiered Systems of Support. This replaced Response to Intervention, which focused on a student's academics.
The Multi-tiered Systems of Support looks at the whole child, including academics and behavior.
"What we also do is we look at the behavior of the kid; we look at the grade level of the students, and then we take all of this information ... and it goes to what we call a referral committee. Amanda (Napolean) sits on the referral committee," Gabrylczyk said.
Napolean said the referral committee includes the two lead diagnosticians, the two lead speech therapists, Napolean and another special services supervisor.
Napolean said she was previously a diagnostician and the other lead special education supervisor was previously a school psychologist.
The six review committee members review every file that comes in from campuses and parent requests. They take the information and make a recommendation of where to start the evaluation. If the data supports a possible learning disability, the information will be funneled down that path. If it supports autism, the information will be funneled down that path.
"From there, then we distribute them out to the evaluators to get consent and get rolling on the evaluation as quickly as possible," Napolean said.
What makes them decline to move forward with an evaluation is when, for example, a parent says their child was commended on the STAAR test last year and they just approached this year and the parent is worried about a disability, Napolean said.
When she looks through the data, Napolean said she can see that the data does not support a disability.
"It's in those those instances where ... it looks more of like a fluke than a pattern.That's what we're looking for is that true incidence of disability because that is something we take very seriously. It's a label that stays with a child forever. Anytime we see potentially that there is a disability, we will absolutely investigate to make sure," Napolean said.
Gabrylczyk said the law gives the special services department the opportunity to say they are going to evaluate a student, or they're not.
"That's why I think school districts throughout the state of Texas are really struggling, is because we have many of those types of situations," he added.
Napolean said when a student is declined, the department has to produce a notice of refusal.
"In that prior written notice, we have to outline the reason we are not accepting the request and that is exactly what we do. We say STAAR scores were this; MAP scores were this. In comparison to grade level peers, this student is not functioning below level and so we outline that very clearly and we send that to the parent. But yes, that takes a lot of time and effort as well," she added.
Parents and teachers can refer students to special services.
Napolean said teachers referring is the preferred way.
"When I say preferred, I'm not discounting anything that a parent would do. But when we get teacher requests for evaluations, we get a lot of data from the campus where they have compiled efforts of different strategies that they've tried and so as an assessor, when I get a referral that shows that they tried to teach it this way, realized the student didn't get it; tried to teach it this way, realized the student didn't get it. That is great data for me," Napolean said.
"As I start to evaluate, it helps me determine which battery would be a good measure for that student. It also tells me that it's not a knee jerk reaction ... They have tried some things first, and so it allows me as the evaluator to include that information in my report. There is a path to eligibility in the state of Texas that is lack of response to intervention. That is data in my report that I can include that says, we have formally evaluated but we also have evidence of lack of response to intervention and we feel this student needs additional supports. When I have a teacher request versus a parent request, I get all of that data and it helps me get to the bottom of that student's learning difficulties," she added.
Gabrylczyk noted that a lot of things happen in students' lives that may throw them off their academic progress.
"We know that kids have significant challenges in life, so when we see a student that, again, is doing really well, and they're scoring and then all of a sudden we see this difference. It is a concern and we take those concerns very seriously. But on the other hand, we also do have students who do have legitimate learning disabilities, and we want to do whatever we can to help them be successful in school. That's the thing about special education. Special education isn't a placement. It's a service that we provide and we all need to remember that all students are general education students first, with special education as a service, not a placement," he added.
Gabrylczyk said things have really changed over the years.
"There's been tons of court cases that went up to the Supreme Court that have really established precedents in what we do and how we do things and school systems in the area of special education. It's a very complex program in dealing with some of the situations that we deal with," he added.
Special Services serves 4,134 students and that figure is increasing.
"It's climbing because what we're seeing is about 80% of those referrals that we receive are kids going into special education and that's alarming. People always ask, why is that? Why is that happening? Nobody really has an answer and I wouldn't even feel comfortable addressing it," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that when a student is referred for special education and the decision is made to evaluate that student, that student is afforded specific protections under Section 504 of the ADA law. What those protections are, for an example, the student needs to be receiving accommodations, the students need to be receiving modifications. Even though the student hasn't qualified for special ed services yet there are protections that still need to happen with the student. What we tell our schools is this, you have a referral and yes, we're going to evaluate the student, but you need to have a plan moving forward and how you're going to accommodate and modify for this particular student," Gabrylczyk said.
The Texas Education Agency website says, "Section 504 requires that school districts provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to qualified students in their jurisdictions who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities."
"People always wonder what percentage of students should be what we determine is eligible for special ed services in school districts. Usually that number is between 10 and 12%. We're now above the 10% threshold ... so that's concerning," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that there has always been a push and pull between the federal and state government.
"If you remember back to 2016, the federal government came into the state of Texas and said, you're not qualifying enough kids. You're at 8%. Then all of a sudden, as Amanda told you this morning, there's been a change in the regulation. Now we're looking at the number is swinging to the other side of the pendulum where there's probably going to be a time where the feds come back into the state saying, well, now you're over identifying kids. So there's kind of that sweet spot, again, between 10 and 12% where we really want to be with eligibility," Gabrylczyk said.
On behavior, he said, the district has students with significant issues with behavior and they do things that are not aligned with district expectations. Gabrylczyk said there has been an increase in behavior issues, but there is no one reason for that.
Special education students fall under district policies and procedures for up to 10 days.
"A principal can discipline a student for up to 10 days for violation of policy. Once they get to that 10th day there's a mechanism within special education law called Manifestation of Determination. What we do with that Manifest Determination mechanism is call a meeting with parents, school officials and sometimes if the student is for an example, at the high school level, they will be invited to the meeting to review what is happening with the student in the areas of behavior," Gabrylczyk said.
"For an example if we are seeing a trend with the behavior, that meeting is established not for discipline, consequences but for change of placement. Is this the correct placement for the student who's having these issues? Because we've suspended the student for 10 days ... Maybe this environment is not the right environment for the student, so we have that MDR meeting, manifest determination review meeting, to determine the placement for that student. Do we move a student from a less restrictive environment to a more restrictive environment? That's what we do with that meeting. That team looks at all the data and makes that determination whether or not that student's disability had an effect on why that student did the discipline," Gabrylczyk said.
There are cases where the disability did not have an effect on the behavior. If that's the case, the student is disciplined accordingly to district policies.
"If the student's disability had an effect on the behavior, then this student is placed right where they're at and stay put. Then what we have to do as a school system is develop a plan — a better plan — to curb and eliminate that behavior and to make sure that that student is making progress in that particular area," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that no special education students can be expelled.
"What ends up happening is we have what we call special circumstances. If you have a special education student, for example, who was trafficking drugs on a campus, that is considered a special circumstance. Another special circumstance is a student who brings a weapon on campus. That is a special circumstance and then the last special circumstance deals with whether or not there was bodily harm done to either a student or a staff member," Gabrylczyk said.
"That would be a special circumstance. For an example, when you're looking at that particular special circumstance, the law says that that student assault on an individual has to have had severe bodily harm on that student. We've been advised by our attorneys who interpret the law for us ...," it's like a hospitalization; a near death experience, he added.
Gabrylczyk said a fight doesn't necessarily constitute a special circumstance.
"Even if a student is taken to a hospital or staff members taken to a hospital, that still may not be good enough, but what we've been told by our attorneys is if there's an ambulance that's involved, there could be some issues within that element of that special circumstance," he added.
Students that fall under special circumstances are placed in the Alternative Education Center for a certain amount of days.
"But with that discipline, they can't go over 40 days without having another hearing, and so more than likely the student is going to have their due process rights heard and then a decision will be made within that meeting," Gabrylczyk said.
"School discipline, and judicial discipline are two separate things. We tend to like to integrate it. So you could have a student who assaults somebody and they could end up in the judicial system ... But the only thing we're responsible for is what the law is pertaining to schools and school districts," Gabrylczyk said.

Article: The Borussia Dortmund vs PSG live stream is the first leg of what promises to be a fascinating Champions League semi-final clash between the old and the new of European soccer. You can watch it live from anywhere with a VPN.
Dortmund, who last lifted this trophy in 1997, have been consistently inconsistent in 2023/24. Edin Terzic's side have picked up four points from their last 12 domestically to drop to fifth, the weekend's 4-1 hammering at rivals RB Leipzig a devastating blow. BVB's goalscorer was Jadon Sancho, who fired his 40th Bundesliga strike to become the top-scoring Englishman in the German top flight. The Man United loanee is finding his feet back at Westfalendstadion and will be determined to put in another thrilling attacking display.
Crowned French champions for a record-extending 12th time at the weekend, PSG have their eyes firmly fixed on the prize they covet most. Since the Parisians' acquisition by Qatari backers in 2011, Champions League victory has been the goal. In the quarter-finals, Kylian Mbappe led the charge with a superb second-leg showing to win 4-1 in Barcelona and avenge the memory of 2017's injury-time capitulation. The 25-year-old will want to cement his status atop the European footballing tree.
The group stage fixtures between the sides late last year finished with a 1-1 draw in Dortmund and a 2-0 PSG win in the French capital. What will happen when it matters most? Make sure you don’t miss a single game by checking out how to watch Champions League live streams.

Article: NEW ORLEANS — (AP) — A new congressional map giving Louisiana a second majority-Black House district was rejected Tuesday by a panel of three federal judges, fueling new uncertainty about district boundaries as the state prepares for fall congressional elections.
The 2-1 ruling forbids the use of a map drawn up in January by the Legislature after a different federal judge blocked a map from 2022. The earlier map maintained a single Black-majority district and five mostly white districts, in a state with a population that is about one-third Black.
The National Democratic Redistricting Committee said backers of the new map will likely seek an emergency order from the U.S. Supreme Court to keep the new map in place while appeals are pursued.
U.S. District Judges David Joseph and Robert Summerhays, both of whom were nominated to the bench by former President Donald Trump, said the newest map violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because “race was the predominate factor” driving its creation.
Judge Carl Stewart dissented, saying the majority gave too little weight to the political motivations involved in drawing the map.
“The panel majority is correct in noting that this is a mixed motive case,” Stewart wrote. “But to note this and then to subsequently make a conclusory determination as to racial predominance is hard to comprehend.”
The ruling means continued uncertainty over what the November election map will look like. Another federal district judge, Shelly Dick of Baton Rouge, has ruled that the state is likely in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act because it divides Black voters not included in majority-Black District 2 among five other congressional districts.
But Tuesday's ruling from the divided federal panel noted that “outside of southeast Louisiana, the State’s Black population is dispersed." The majority criticized the new mostly Black district, which stretched across the state from Shreveport in the northwest into southeast Louisiana, linking black populations from the Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge metro areas.
Joseph and Summerhays said they would not rule on the feasibility of creating a second majority-Black district that would comply with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
“However, we do emphasize that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act never requires race to predominate in drawing Congressional districts at the sacrifice of traditional districting principles,” they wrote.
The panel set a May 6 status conference. Meanwhile, the case before Judge Dick in Baton Rouge is still alive, and state election officials say they need to know the district boundaries by May 15. The sign-up period for the fall elections in Louisiana is in mid-July.
The decision gives new hope to Rep. Garret Graves, a white Republican incumbent whose district was seriously altered by the new map. And it raises questions for state Sen. Cleo Fields, a Democrat and former Congress member who had declared he would run in the new district.
Rep. Troy Carter, the only Democrat and only Black member of the state's current congressional delegation, criticized the ruling.
“This is just plain WRONG,” Carter posted on the social platform X on Tuesday evening.
The new map maintains safe districts for five incumbents: Carter and four white Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise. It was challenged by 12 self-described non-African American voters, whose lawsuit said the districts amounted to unconstitutional racial gerrymandering.
Supporters of the new map said politics, not race, was the main factor driving its creation — and that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry’s support for it bolstered that argument. The plan had put Graves, who supported an opponent of Landry in last fall’s governor’s race, at a disadvantage.
The Associated Press left a telephone message seeking comment with Landry's office Tuesday night.
The majority in Tuesday's opinion acknowledged the argument. “However, given the slim majority Republicans hold in the United States House of Representatives, even if such personal or intra-party animosity did or does exist, it is difficult to fathom that Louisiana Republicans would intentionally concede a seat to a Democratic candidate on those bases,” they wrote.
The ruling was the latest development in a drawn-out legal battle over redistricting, which happens every 10 years to account for population shifts reflected in census data.
Louisiana’s Republican-dominated Legislature drew a new map in 2022 that was favorable to all six current incumbents. Then-Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, vetoed the map, but the majority-Republican Legislature overrode him, leading to a court challenge.
In June 2022, Dick issued an injunction against the map, saying challengers would likely win their claim that it violated the Voting Rights Act. As the case was appealed, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an unexpected ruling that favored Black voters in a congressional redistricting case in Alabama.
Dick sided with challengers who said the 2022 map packed a significant number of voters in one district — District 2 which stretches from New Orleans to the Baton Rouge area — while “cracking” the remaining Black population by apportioning it to other mostly white districts.
Last November, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave the state a January deadline for drawing a new congressional district. Landry, who was the state’s attorney general when he was elected to succeed the term-limited Edwards, called a special session to redraw the map, saying the Legislature should do it rather than a federal judge.
The new map does not resemble sample maps that supporters of a new majority-Black district suggested earlier, which would have created a new district largely covering the northeastern part of the state.
The opponents of the latest map filed their lawsuit in the federal court system’s Western District of Louisiana, which is dominated by Republican-appointed judges. Dick was nominated to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama. Stewart, the dissenter on the panel, was nominated to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by former President Bill Clinton.
Such cases involving constitutional issues and remapping are often assigned to panels of two district judges and an appeals court circuit judge.

Connor McCaffery is a name synonymous with dedication in collegiate sports. Born on July 13, 1998, in Iowa City, Iowa, Connor grew up in a family deeply ingrained in sports. His father, Fran McCaffery, has been the head coach of the University of Iowa men’s basketball team since 2010. His mother, Margeret McCaffery, also played college basketball at the University of Notre Dame. It's no wonder that athletics runs in Connor's blood.
Connor began making waves early in his athletic career. Excelling in both basketball and baseball, he was a highly sought-after recruit out of high school. Ultimately, he chose to attend the University of Iowa. Now, he has become a key player for the Hawkeyes' basketball team. On the court, Connor McCaffery's skills are evident. As a point guard for the Hawkeyes, Connor has showcased his leadership qualities and basketball IQ, contributing significantly to the team's success.
Hawkeye Baseball Player
Before focusing solely on college basketball, McCaffery also showcased great baseball talent. He played for the Hawkeye baseball team. Playing both corner outfield spots and first base, McCaffery often made local headlines for his plays. Although he had the potential to go big in the sport and could’ve been drafted into the Major League, his injuries and health complications hindered him. Furthermore, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, it put a stop to the baseball season that year.
Joining The Indiana Pacers
As a sports genius, McCaffery didn’t stop at just playing basketball and baseball. He has also become involved in the NBA’s Indiana Pacers. Following his graduation from the University of Iowa in May 2023, McCaffery embarked on a new chapter by joining the Indiana Pacers as a team assistant. Balancing rigorous training and competitions with his basketball and baseball teams, he also pursued degrees in finance and political science.
Connor McCaffery And Caitlin Clark
Connor McCaffery and Caitlin Clark began dating in April 2023, forming a power couple in the world of collegiate athletics. However, they chose to keep their relationship private for several months before making it public. It wasn't until Clark posted a photo with McCaffery on her Instagram in August that their fans learned about their romance. In the relationship debut photo, the two were cuddled up in a boat, and Clark captioned it: “Best end to summer.”
McCaffery on the other hand, waited until Clark’s birthday on January 22, to post her on his Instagram account. Wishing her a happy birthday, he wrote: “Happy Birthday 22. Wish I was there to celebrate with you — you deserve the best day. Golden Bday / T Swift year will be the best yet. With all that you’ve already accomplished, there is so much more in store for you and your special self. I admire you in every way and I love you.” Months later, the two lovebirds celebrated their first anniversary, with McCaffery penning a lovely post to the woman with his heart. The post read: “One year w the best. Doing life w u has been easy, and you never cease to amaze me… can’t wait to watch u live out urdreams in person. Love you.”

Article: Police surround Columbia University as antiwar protests grow at U.S. campuses
Updated April 30, 2024 at 21:15 PM ET
New York police surrounded Columbia University and activists put out calls for more protestors on social media as the chaotic pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus appeared to reach a turning point late Tuesday.
Protesters have occupied the central campus building of Hamilton Hall for most of Tuesday, after the school asked them to voluntarily disperse from an encampment.
The NYPD, with some officers seen in riot gear and carrying zip tie handcuffs, blocked off sections of Broadway near the Columbia Morningside campus late Tuesday.
Activists asked supporters on social media to "mobilize." And people have shown up. A large crowd of protesters gathered outside of the gates of the campus Tuesday evening.
The tensions are one snapshot of protests erupting at college campuses across the U.S. The students are calling for universities to sell off their investments in companies that have businesses or investments in Israel because of the country's invasion of Gaza.
The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, while Israel says some 1,200 Israelis were killed by Hamas in an assault last October. Israel says Hamas is still holding 133 hostages.
Columbia has started suspending the students who have refused to leave and they now face expulsion.
In announcing the disciplinary actions, the school saidon Tuesday that the protesters "have chosen to escalate to an untenable situation."
Two prominent New York Democrats, U.S. Reps. Jerry Nadler and Adriano Espailla, called on the school to "move quickly and swiftly to remove the students who have engaged in unlawful activity."
They wrote in a shared statement that the students are entitled to free speech, but criticized recent actions of the demonstrations at Columbia.
On the other side of the U.S., students broke into the library at Portland State University in Oregon, triggering a campus-wide shutdown.
Many such demonstrations continue with no end in sight, but administrations at Northwestern University and Brown University managed to strike deals with protesters that included agreements to examine the schools' investments.
Campuses see big protests across the U.S.
In Oregon, Portland State University closed its campus on Tuesday, after demonstrators took over the school's library. The protesters broke into the Branford Price Millar Library during the night, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports.
Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt's office said his position is that "the actions taking place have crossed into criminal behavior, and we will prosecute."
Earlier on Tuesday at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, police arrested demonstrators who refused to shut down a "Gaza Solidarity Encampment" protest that began at the Polk Place quad on campus Friday.
Police detained some 30 protesters and moved them elsewhere on campus, according to student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel, which says six people in the group were arrested. Video posted on Instagram by the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine showed UNC police chief Brian James informing protesters that they were trespassing, as they chanted, "We will not stop, we will not rest."
UNC interim Chancellor Lee Roberts and Provost Christopher Clemens sent a letter early Tuesday ordering protesters to dismantle the camp and leave, threatening arrests and potential expulsion.
On Monday, police arrested nearly 80 people protesting in support of Palestinians at the University of Texas at Austin after demonstrators set up an encampment on the south lawn, according to member station KUT.
"Police and troopers in riot gear surrounded the protesters and made arrests," KUT reports.
UT Austin says that protesters "escalated by becoming physically and verbally combative" when approached, adding that it moved against the encampment because demonstrators' tents violated school rules. The arrests were for trespassing or disorderly conduct, it said.
The Palestine Solidarity Committee in Austin, a group organizing protests, condemned school president Jay Hartzell's administration for "yet again calling police to violently suppress students" — a reference to dozens of arrests made last Wednesday.
Along with its demands related to Israel and the Palestinians, the group says Hartzell — who has Gov. Greg Abbott's support — must resign. The group says it plans to hold another demonstration on Wednesday at noon, local time.
Northwestern and Brown reach agreements with protestors
This week Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and, as of Tuesday, Brown University in Rhode Island reached deals with student protesters to deescalate the demonstrations.
Brown President Christina Paxson shared details on the agreement in a campus-wide message on Tuesday.
"The devastation and loss of life in the Middle East has prompted many to call for meaningful change, while also raising real issues about how best to accomplish this," Paxson wrote. "Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog, debate and listening to each other."
Students of the Brown Divest Coalition set up an unauthorized encampment on the school's College Green on April 24, according to the university. With this new deal to deescalate protests, the students have agreed to end the encampment by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Additionally, they will refrain from any further actions "that would violate Brown's conduct code" through the end of the school year, including Commencement and Reunion Weekend.
In return, the school said it would invite five students to meet with five members of the Corporation of Brown University, the University's governing body that includes a Board of Trustees and a Board of Fellows, in May. The students will be allowed to hold a presentation on why Brown's endowment should divest from "companies enabling and profiting from the genocide in Gaza," the agreement stated.
Paxson said she will also ask the Advisory Committee on University Resources Management, the panel responsible for reviewing whether Brown's business and investment practices follow ethical and moral standards consistent with the school's goals and values, to provide a recommendation on divestment by Sept. 30, which will then be brought to the Corporation for a vote at its October meeting.
Dozens of tents set up by protesters at Northwestern in Evanston have been removed from the school's Deering Meadow, after a pro-Palestinian coalition agreed to a deal with school leaders on Monday.
Under the agreement, the Northwestern Divestment Coalition can continue to organize limited protests through at least June 1. Protesters who aren't affiliated with the school are also barred from participating.
In return, the school agreed to transparency measures around its investments, to give support to Middle Eastern and Muslim students, and to fund the "full cost of attendance for five Palestinian undergraduates" to attend the school for four years, along with two visiting Palestinian faculty for two years.
The university also said it will look to add more support for Jewish students. It called recent reports of antisemitic and anti-Muslim/Palestinian incidents "unacceptable."
The school said its goal was to "ensure that the violence and escalation we have seen elsewhere does not happen here at Northwestern."
Columbia and protesters hit a new impasse on Monday
While demonstrators elsewhere have reached deals with their schools' administrations, campus officials at Columbia have rejected student demands to divest from companies operating in Israel.
So, students entered Hamilton Hall early Tuesday morning, chained and barricaded its doors and have been using a rope system to get supplies from supporters, reported WKCR, the university radio station.
Outside, a crowd cheered as the facade was draped with signs reading "Intifada" and "Hind's Hall" — the latter a reference to Hind Rajab, a young Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza in January.
The university is now under what amounts to a lockdown of the campus in Manhattan's Morningside Heights, with access restricted to essential-service employees and students who live in residential halls on the campus.
"This building has now been liberated," an Instagram account affiliated with the student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest announced as it posted an image of Hamilton Hall, echoing language used during a 1968 protest.
Columbia students protesting racism against Black people and the Vietnam War were occupying Hamilton Hall and other buildings exactly 56 years ago — on April 30, 1968 — when police violently cleared the campus. More than 700 people were arrested and almost 150 people were injured.
The New York Police Department says it has officers stationed outside the university, but not on school grounds.
Tuesday's campus shutdown was mirrored by one at Barnard College, which is closely affiliated with Columbia.
Columbia's leadership has set several deadlines as it seeks to reach an agreement with demonstrators to end the encampment, as the school said it violates school policies and is a threat to campus safety, a disturbance to Jewish students and students trying to study and sleep.
Columbia seeks ways to hold graduation ceremony
Columbia's last day of classes for the spring semester was Monday, marking the start of "reading week," in which students traditionally prepare for looming final exams. Those exams are currently set to begin on Friday, with commencement planned for May 15.
Columbia President Minouche Shafik said on Monday that she wanted the protesters to "disperse voluntarily," urging them to consider that the graduating class of 2024 did not get to have their high school commencement ceremonies in person due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The president also said the school was prepared to allow demonstrations to resume after exams and commencement. But, Shafik added, protesters would need to submit an application at least two days in advance, and protests would be allowed only in designated areas.
Shafik said Columbia has supported protests and vigils that happened earlier in the year, as they were peaceful and didn't disturb campus operations.
But she added the encampment has caused an "unwelcoming environment" and "hostile environment" for Jewish students, and violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws discrimination at schools that receive federal funding.

Article: Members of Fort Worth’s ad hoc council committee on emergency medical response have recommended that MedStar employees who transition to the proposed fire department-based EMS model receive civil service benefits.
Michael Glynn, president of the Fort Worth Professional Firefighters Association, called the decision “the right thing to do,” and said it sends a message that Fort Worth is committed to caring for its EMS employees.
Tuesday’s decision comes two weeks after the committee narrowed down the EMS options under consideration to a fire-based model that would incorporate MedStar employees. If the Fort Worth City Council approves the committee’s recommendation, MedStar’s current employees would come on board as Fort Worth employees and serve as paramedics and emergency medical technicians on ambulances run by the Fire Department.
“This is going to be a great opportunity for us to work together as one team in one department,” Glynn told the Star-Telegram.
Even though the EMS workers wouldn’t serve as firefighters, their status as civil service employees would allow them to receive line-of-duty death and injury benefits, among other protections afforded to firefighters and police officers.
The Fort Worth City Council is expected to vote on adopting the ad hoc committee’s EMS recommendations and the implementation/transition plan on May 21.
MedStar has served as the sole ambulance provider for Fort Worth and the surrounding communities since 1986. Spokesperson Matt Zavadsky said MedStar will support whatever decision the council makes.
“Whatever it’s going to take to make a smooth transition and make sure that the new system is as operationally efficient, and clinically proficient as possible, we want to help facilitate that,” Zavadsky said.
Assistant City Manager Valerie Washington said the city’s goal is to make the change to fire-based EMS as easy as possible for residents.
“We’re going to do everything we can to make it a seamless process so users of the system won’t notice anything,” Washington said.
According to Washington, the transition could take up to 18 months, though she thinks that estimate is on the high end. City officials are working with Fitch and Associates, the independent consultant hired to assess Fort Worth’s EMS system, to fine tune the timeline.
A major part of the transition, according to Washington, will be the hiring and onboarding of employees to staff the ambulances.
“We would anticipate sitting down with all of the (MedStar) employees and determining, you know, which ones can move over,” Washington said. “We’re anticipating that many of them will.”
According to Zavadsky, the ambulance service currently employs around 400 paramedics and emergency medical technicians. Around 100 more employees work in dispatch and various support roles, including logistics, human resources, payroll and those who re-stock the ambulances.
It’s not clear where those who serve in support roles at MedStar would fit into the new EMS model, but Washington said some of those functions may go to other city departments outside the Fire Department.
Another part of the transition, Washington said, will be working with local hospitals and other healthcare facilities to manage their own inter-facility transports. MedStar currently provides all inter-facility transports for Fort Worth and the 13 member cities.
Officials said Tuesday that an inter-facility transfer working group will identify vendors and help coordinate the details for this portion of the transition.
“That’s definitely one of those processes that we want to make sure is solid,” Washington told the Star-Telegram.
Fort Worth is also working toward streamlining its 911 service. Currently the Fort Worth Police Department, Fire Department and MedStar each use separate communications and dispatch centers. Washington said the goal is to get all of the area’s emergency services using the same technology and eventually bring them under the same roof.
“Our goal is making sure the 911 process is as efficient as possible and making sure the end users get the fast service that they need,” Washington said at Tuesday’s meeting. “We know that time matters, and so we’re trying to find where there are minutes, seconds in the process that we could shave this down.”

Article: PALM HARBOR, Fla. - Two people were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide at a home on Moreno Drive in Palm Harbor on Tuesday morning.
The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said deputies responded to 4192 Moreno Drive just before 8:30 a.m. after a 911 call reported that a man and woman were found shot.
Stacey McLean, 52, was found dead in a bedroom inside the home when deputies arrived. Investigators also said Darryl Serraj, 26, was found dead in a separate bedroom with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Detectives said Serraj was in a romantic relationship with McLean's daughter for about five years, but it had ended recently. Serraj, according to deputies, broke into the home, murdered McLean and took his own life.
Authorities said the official cause of death will be determined by the Medical Examiner's Office.

Article: Sarnia-Lambton makes sales pitch to land EV supply chain plant
Already major players in the petroleum and chemical sectors, Lambton County hopes to be adding electric vehicle (EV) parts to its wide range of industry.
“We've been actively engaged with a variety of companies associated with the EV and EV battery supply chain,” said Matthew Slotwinsski, interim CEO of the Sarnia-Lambton Economic Partnership.
He continued, “Were really encouraged to see the progress of some of these discussions. Our hope is that the Sarnia-Lambton area is able to land one of these investments in the near future.”
Honda recently announced they will be making EVs and batteries in Alliston, Ont.
They will also need two more supply chain plants.
“They look for communities with a culture of manufacturing as they need to be able to get up and running for very tight start up production,” explained Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturer's Association.

He continued, “They need a workforce that understands advanced manufacturing, and in a place where that workforce is typically committed to a company for years rather than a lot of turnover they see in places like the U.S. southeast.”
St. Clair Township hopes to be in the mix.
“We have a lot of industrial land here in the St. Clair Township, so we're open for business,” said Jeff Agar, mayor of St. Clair Township. “We have the places and fab shops. We’re just loaded here and we have the manpower.”
After seeing nearby Windsor and St. Thomas land major factories, Slotwinski believes Sarnia-Lambton is the “place to be” for a new investment for the supply chain. He touted how well they thrive when it comes to heavy industry.

"We have large scale Greenfield heavy industrial land, with large utilities with capacities available,” said Slotwinski. “Additionally, our logistics infrastructure is fantastic. When you look at the access to roads, rail, water, and really the opportunity to present into Ontario facilities as well as those in the U.S. as well. We believe we are strategically located to see new investment.”
Volpe believes the major companies are contemplating a short list for their cathode active material and precursor processing plants.
“There's more than a few municipalities and regions that feel like they're in good stead for this including Sarnia,” said Volpe.

Article: Perhaps more than any digital audio workstation (DAW) I've tested recently, Studio One makes it easy to record audio, compose music, and mix. It's as if someone took Avid Pro Tools, removed many unnecessary mouse button presses, and rearranged the menus and dialogs to make sense. Studio One doesn't scale to larger studios as well as Pro Tools, but it's an inspired audio editing choice for anyone who needs a serious DAW and dislikes Avid's subscription pricing (though the latter may be changing, as I'll explain). While Studio One is an excellent app, our Editors' Choices for digital audio workstations are Cubase Pro for Windows and Apple Logic Pro on macOS, with Avid Pro Tools as our cross-platform pick for high-end DAWs.
How Much Does Studio One Cost?
PreSonus offers four ways to get Studio One; the downloadable free Prime version has been discontinued, but PreSonus says you can still access it by installing the 30-day trial and letting it expire. Let's start with the two Perpetual licenses: Studio One Artist ($99.99) includes unlimited audio and MIDI tracks, drag-and-drop editing and comping, track folders and event-based effects, five virtual instruments, and 28 effects plug-ins. Artist also supports adding third-party VSTs and AU plug-ins, and it works with Studio One Remote for the iPad and Android. Professional ($399.99) adds built-in Melodyne pitch correction for vocals, many more effects (including a multiband compressor and convolution reverb), and more virtual instruments. This remains the flagship DAW, and it has new features that I'll cover below.
Your other two options are subscription offerings. The Studio One+ plan gives you access to Studio One Professional, Notion notation software, additional sounds and plug-ins, cloud storage with collaboration workspaces, and a master class library of videos and live streams for $19.95 per month. PreSonus has moved many add-on plug-ins you could purchase to Studio One+, and they are no longer available for Perpetual licenses.
New for version 6.6, the Studio One Hybrid plan gives you the same lineup for $179.95 per year, plus a Perpetual license for Studio One Pro that's yours to keep. This just-launched plan is confusing because it seems to imply no one should spend $399.95 on Studio One Pro anymore if they get it for $179.95 with the Hybrid subscription, yet the Perpetual license remains on sale. When I asked about this, a PreSonus spokesperson responded, "The Perpetual license awarded at the end of the annual subscription period is non-updating. A user who does not renew their Hybrid subscription will be granted the most current version of Studio One Pro, without access to future updates," meaning you will continue to get updates if you buy the perpetual license.

Can My PC Run Studio One?
Studio One requires Windows 10 20H1 or Windows 11, macOS 10.14 or higher, 40GB of free storage for the Pro version, and at least an Intel Core i3 or AMD A10 CPU. PreSonus recommends at least 8GB of RAM and a 1,366-by-768-pixel display resolution. PreSonus is also running a public beta for a new Linux version, a welcome and rarely supported platform among major DAWs.
For this review, I tested PreSonus Studio One 6.6 on a MacBook Pro 16-inch (Late 2021, M1 Pro) running macOS Sonoma 14.4.1, a second-generation Focusrite Scarlett 6i6, a pair of PreSonus Eris E8 XT studio monitors, and a Nektar GX61 MIDI keyboard controller.
Start Page, Interface, and Instruments
A significant change for version 6 is apparent immediately: The new Start Page now contains useful Smart Templates for different kinds of projects, plus more tools for organizing your existing ones. As before, Studio One automatically suggests dates and names for your new projects to help keep you organized. Studio One Professional now supports the open-source file format DAWproject, which lets you share project files with Bitwig Studio owners. The files contain editable MIDI data, plug-in settings, and more. It remains to be seen if other DAW makers adopt the format, but anything in this direction is encouraging news.
Getting settled in Studio One is pretty straightforward if you're coming from another DAW, although it's probably a little intimidating for first-timers. Studio One has received a more modern look with dark and light themes, plus all the plug-ins have received new coats of paint. New projects open with a clean view, but by the time you're knee-deep in recording and mixing, expect a lot of visual clutter. The good news is that you can remove many elements, and a "minimal" preset lets you simplify the view considerably.
Other new features: A new Lyrics Track lets you add, edit, or move lyrics, and the latest 6.6 update improves the display on Show and Project pages. The new Global Video Track makes it easier to make quick adjustments to a video production or move around podcast pieces for final assembly.
PreSonus has always bundled a large, if uneven, sound set with Studio One. This is still the case, and Studio One hasn't added any new instruments in quite some time. The one exception is Lead Architect, an exclusive synthesizer instrument for Studio One+ that is not present in the current Professional version when you buy it. Omitting it from Professional, which has been in dire need of some new instruments, doesn't bode well for the future of the perpetual offerings taken together with the expanding subscription plan options mentioned above.
Recording and Editing With Studio One
One of the best things about Studio One is how it was conceived from the beginning to speed up typical recording and editing tasks. True to form, getting started requires fewer clicks than in some other DAWs. Click once to record, once for the metronome, and once for rewinding; double-click to split a clip into two. It's fast, and the program is super-responsive. You can set up virtual instruments so that you just have to drag the plug-ins over, complete with a picture representation. You can easily create Split and Multi instruments by dragging and dropping additional ones on the same track.
Some perennial features in other DAWs have been missing in Studio One for a while. But PreSonus is catching up, with additions such as Track Presets, which stack commonly used instruments or plug-in chains and all their settings together for call-up with a single click. Studio One now offers custom color assignments and color presets—something I wish every DAW had—along with auto-zoom during editing and more drag-and-drop editing features. You can customize the interface by adding or removing almost every tool from the various toolbars. You can even set the keyboard shortcuts to mirror Pro Tools or another DAW to ease migration to Studio One.
Most of the regular audio editing features you'd expect in a proper DAW are also here. You can trim or split clips, add fades, and adjust the gain of a clip right from the Edit window. Studio One (in Professional guise) was the first DAW to integrate genuine Melodyne pitch correction directly within the app rather than exporting audio, correcting it, and reimporting it back in as you do in Pro Tools. Since then, other popular DAWs, such as Logic and FL Studio, have added some type of integrated pitch correction. It's not only faster, but it also means you can continue to edit the pitch-corrected clips from within Studio One without having to return to Melodyne first. In version 6.6, ARA-enabled plug-ins are now available as audio editors on the Project page.
The terrific Chord Track, available only in Professional, lets you create, listen to, and change chord progressions. With it, you can quickly move around song sections and test arrangements. Chord Track also allows for harmonic editing; you can play an instrument, drag the clip to Chord Track, see what you played written out harmonically, and then add new notes to complement it. You can also drop any MIDI file into Chord Track to extract its chords and automatically create strum patterns. Studio One also supports "ripple editing," which lets you insert a section into the middle of a song; the remaining content then ripples down automatically, so you don't have to do complex cut-and-paste maneuvers. Magix Sequoia has offered this for years, and it's great to see it here. Based on PreSonus Notion, the score editor now supports tablature, lead sheets, and drum maps, making it much more useful.
In a nod to Ableton Live, MainStage, and other performance-oriented software, Studio One includes an integrated live performance environment to run and control complete shows on stage. The Show page lets you cue up backing tracks, change patches, and set up virtual and real instrument players in one window (as you can in Apple's MainStage). You can export channel strips, mixdowns, and instrument patches to the Show and arrange setlists. The program also presents real-time controls in a separate Perform view, plus more extensive metering and a virtual rack of plug-ins for effects, all of which minimize fumbling around in the dark for the right sounds before you start the next song. You can even program pauses between certain songs to talk with the audience or set it to go right into the next track.
Mixing, Dolby Atmos, and New Plug-Ins
The big news on the mixing side is Spatial Audio support, which is present from beginning to end in each project. For example, you can record in Dolby Atmos using a multichannel microphone array and mix in headphones binaurally. All relevant bundled effects plug-ins have been upgraded to support Dolby Atmos. Studio One Remote also features surround mixing and visualizations on your phone or tablet, complete with a similar 3D surround panner and multitouch support as on the desktop. Version 6.6 also adds support for Dolby Atmos composite beds.
There are some new plug-ins available as well. The new multi-tap Surround Delay can synchronize with the project tempo. DeEsser has a sharp Listen feature that can automatically find the most problematic frequency and tune itself to minimize it. The Vocoder combines two input signals and processes them with bandpass filters for glorious 1980s fun. Most importantly, two existing plug-ins received significant updates. The OpenAir2 convolution reverb sounds terrific, with plenty of lush vocal spaces you can sidechain. Pro EQ3 now offers a linear-phase low-cut, a 12th-octave spectrum display, and I/O meters with adjustable range. The latest version lets you solo individual frequency bands, and it even offers built-in dynamic equalization that would typically have you reaching for the multiband compressor or moving faders manually.
Despite its cluttered appearance, the mixer is laid out well. You can insert all kinds of effects, and PreSonus provides dozens of Extended FX chains in a separate drop-down folder that helps you mix faster. You can search for plug-ins just by typing, and you can drag inserts from one channel to another and mirror them immediately as you can in Logic. The mixer now lets you control FX/Bus sends sidechains and Cue Mix from the main faders with a right-click. Three pan modes are now available—Dual, Balance, and Binaural. The new Mixer Channel Overview page shows you all relevant settings for a given track, including its controls, inserts, sends, and cue mix, plus track icons for the first time.
You can snapshot the entire mixer for recall with Mixer Scenes, which replaces saving multiple versions of a project—although, unlike Logic Pro, Studio One lets you mix a song a bunch of different ways and recall them all instantly. One feature I've always liked in Studio One is setting up a reverb on a send; you only have to drag the reverb to the track. Studio One automatically sets up the send, the plug-in, the return, and the level so that you've got a reverb happening instantly, and you can then activate the same send on additional tracks. You can also click the send to bring up the reverb plug-in to change the release, the type, or any other parameter without first hunting up and down the mixing board for the correct channel. This is all significantly faster than it is in Pro Tools.
Using Studio One's Mix Engine FX and its Console Shaper plug-in, you can model the sound of an analog console from within the mixing engine, including drive, noise, and crosstalk. The standard compressor also sounds good on the mix bus when set to a low ratio (1.3) for just a few dB of reduction on the peaks. In the box, you get enough effects to bring a project from start to finish, including mastering (though I'll always recommend having an experienced second pair of engineers do the final mastering if the budget allows). Finally, version 6.6 adds built-in TuneCore support for distributing your finished masters across multiple digital streaming services.
Studio for All
Although Pro Tools remains the pro-studio standard, there have been some high-profile defections to Studio One. There probably should be more, given how good this program is. However, PreSonus' recent move to push the Hybrid and Studio One+ subscription plans seems to indicate that Studio One is heading in the same direction as Pro Tools when it comes to subscriptions, which will discourage some. Pro Tools still excels in importing session and individual track data, and its Smart Tool-based approach to audio editing is second to none. Unless you need Avid's support for broadcast standards and massive control surfaces or you want to have maximum compatibility with other studios and sessions, going with Studio One remains a smart alternative choice for a quality DAW. Our platform-specific Editors' Choice winners for PC and Mac DAWs are Cubase Pro and Apple Logic Pro, respectively, and Avid Pro Tools is our Editors' Choice for high-end, cross-platform DAWs.
PreSonus reinvented the common digital audio workstation with Studio One, and the latest version further hones its capabilities for working professionals.

Article: Rihanna’s been teasing R9 for so long now that nobody knows what to believe anymore. At this point, it’s anyone’s guess when or if the album is indeed coming. The most recent mention of the album came during a red carpet event for her Fenty makeup line in Los Angeles on April 28th. During this appearance, she teased R9 once again, saying "It's gonna be amazing." She also went on about how much the album would showcase her evolution as an artist.
It’s been eight long years since Riri blessed us with a body of work. During this time, however, she’s dropped a handful of singles, including the Oscar-nominated "Lift Me Up" from the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack. She has primarily focused on her fashion and beauty empire, and since it’s raking in billions, we can’t really blame her. Until definite information is put out, here's a chronological list of all the information Riri (and others) has put out about R9 since 2018.
2018: Rihanna Teases R9
The first time Rihanna stirred excitement among her fans about the release of her ninth studio album was in 2018. In an Instagram reply, she shared that fans should expect the album in 2019, sparking anticipation for new music, following her last album, ANTI, released in January 2016. The album was also rumored to be a double-disc release, with one disc featuring chart-friendly songs and the other comprising moody and experimental tracks.
2019: A Potential Reggae Release
As time passed, rumors surfaced that Rihanna’s upcoming album would involve producer Supa Dups, known for his work with Beenie Man and Sean Paul. With this information, R9 became subject to reggae and dancehall speculations. These rumors and sporadic updates continued to keep the conversation about R9 alive for a while. Moreover, twice in early 2019, Rihanna shared studio session photos on Instagram.
The first time was in January when she posted a video showing her at work in the studio. She did it again in March of the same year when she shared a photo of her best friend and project manager Jennifer Rosales' baby in the studio. Rosales would repost the baby pic on her own Instagram with this caption: “When tia @badgalriri gives you the first listen 😎. #newmusic.” No one knows whatever became of these studio visits, however.
Further along in the year, in an extensive interview with the New York Times Magazine for a cover story in May, Rihanna confirmed that she was working on a reggae sound. ANTI had featured the iconic hit “Work,” and so fans were thirsting for more. People soon speculated that the album could drop at any moment. Ultimately, this never materialized. The period coincided with her promotion of the Fenty fashion line, and amidst the album buzz, Rihanna was named by Forbes as the richest female musician in the world, and everyone forgot about R9 for a moment.
2020: “Aggressively Working On Music”
Despite the COVID-19 outbreak, some still held out hope that this would be the year Rihanna releases R9. Why? In May 2020, she graced the cover of British Vogue, and made history as the first person to wear a durag on the magazine cover. Rihanna spoke about her multifaceted career and balancing her music with her business. She then mentioned how she was "very aggressively working on music.” However, she did not disclose a release date. Like a true artist she said: "There are no rules. There’s no format. There’s just good music, and if I feel it, I’m putting it out."
2023: The Super Bowl And World Tour Rumors
In February 2023, Rihanna shared insights about her much-anticipated album R9 in an interview for her Vogue UK cover story. During the interview, Rihanna expressed her desire to release the album in 2023, saying, "I want it to be this year. Like, honestly, it’d be ridiculous if it’s not this year." She also emphasized how much fun she had to have with her music and the importance of aligning the album with her creative vision.
However, the interview took place shortly after Rihanna's performance at the Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show, and the announcement of her second pregnancy with A$AP Rocky. Evidently, there was little hope it was coming out that year. Shockingly Capital FM reported that Rihanna was "quietly planning" a huge comeback world tour for 2024 and 2025. However, despite the speculation, insiders eventually clarified that "no tour has been confirmed.”
2024: Rihanna Teases R9 Yet Again
For her Interview Magazine cover story, Rihanna explained how her creative process for R9 had “a lot of visual ideas,” but “no songs for them yet.” Again, on April 28 and 29, 2024, she made headlines with updates about her personal style and her long-awaited album. She also recently hinted that ASAP Rocky has had some hand in helping with the project's development. At a Fenty Beauty event, Rihanna shared more about her upcoming album, reiterating that it will be “amazing,” and that the delay in its release is because she wants it to truly represent her evolution. All we can do is wait.

Article: Lawyers painted two different pictures Tuesday on what happened when Jediah “JuJu” Perry was shot dead in his girlfriend’s car on 5th Avenue in Gary.
Deputy Prosecutor Tara Villarreal said in opening arguments that Rahmere Dunn killed Perry, 21, while he was buying marijuana from Dunn. Afterward, Dunn tried to delete their Facebook messages leading up to the shooting.
It was a “drug deal gone wrong,” she said.
Defense lawyer Lonnie Randolph II disagreed, saying it was self-defense. Perry tried to enlist a cousin to rob Dunn, he said. Perry held a gun to his head in the car and Dunn had no choice but to shoot him.
“It was not a drug deal gone wrong,” he told jurors. “It was a robbery that went bad.”
Dunn, now 25, of Whiting and formerly East Chicago, stands trial this week. He is charged with murder in Perry’s Nov. 12, 2021 death. He has pleaded not guilty.
Perry was shot five times in the head inside a car in front of Kelly’s Soul Food, 5025 W. 5th Ave., charges allege.
Lawrence Kelly, the restaurant’s owner, testified he called 911 around closing time after noticing the Civic had been parked outside with the lights on for “hours” — at least since 4 p.m.
Prosecutors played different segments of security footage. One part appeared to show Dunn jumping out of Perry’s white Honda Civic, running back to his Chrysler 300, then taking off.
On cross-examination, he told Randolph he didn’t hear or see the shooting.
Earlier, LaDonna Reed, Perry’s mother, said she last talked to him about a week before the shooting, telling him he should “watch people” he hung around with. A family member told her there was a shooting and she helped the coroner’s office identify her son’s body.
Police were called at 8:39 p.m. Nov. 12, 2021 where officers found Perry unresponsive inside his white Honda Civic leaning against the driver’s side window.
Security video appeared to show Perry circling the block, then pulling up next to Dunn’s Chrysler 300 at 4:53 p.m.
The man, later identified as Dunn, wore a reflective vest when he got out of the 300 and jumped inside Perry’s car.
The man in the vest went back into his car before grabbing something from his vehicle, charges state. He then went back into Perry’s car before he suddenly got out, hopped back into his car and sped off on 5th Avenue around 4:57 p.m., the affidavit states.
Police were tipped via a screenshot of Dunn’s Facebook profile that he was meeting with Perry before his death.
Investigators traced Dunn’s car via local road license plate reader systems and obtained footage that his car — with unique features like black rims and a panoramic moon roof — was in the area around the time of Perry’s murder, documents allege.
From a law enforcement database, detectives learned Dunn worked at the Lear Corp. as a forklift operator, which required him to wear a protective vest. The company said his employment ended in October 2021, documents state.
Hammond Police arrested Dunn on Nov. 30, 2021 for an unrelated crime, telling Gary Police they also found the vest in his trunk.
Cellphone records showed Dunn called Perry at 4:27 p.m. Nov. 12, 2021, just before they met, the affidavit alleges.
A search warrant for Perry’s Facebook account showed he messaged Dunn about buying marijuana just before the shooting, charges state. Dunn responded with an Apple Maps link to the soul food store as a meeting point.
“That’s u ain’t it,” Dunn wrote.

Article: LIVINGSTON, La. - A 54-year-old Louisiana man will undergo physical castration in addition to 50 years in prison as part of his sentence for raping a juvenile.
Glenn Sullivan, Sr., 54, recently pleaded guilty to four counts of second degree rape, according to 21st Judicial District Attorney Scott M. Perrilloux.
The case started in July 2022 when the Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office said a young woman told detectives that Sullivan had raped her multiple times when she was 14 years old.
The victim also said, as a result, she became pregnant, and a DNA test revealed Sullivan had impregnated her.
Detectives believe Sullivan had groomed her and used threats of violence against her and her family to keep the victim from coming forward.
"So many of these types of cases go unreported because of fear," Perrilloux said in a Facebook post. "The strength it must have taken for this young woman to tell the truth in the face of threats and adversity is truly incredible," Perrilloux said."
"Sex crimes against juveniles are the most malicious crimes we prosecute," Assistant District Attorney Brad J. Cascio added. "I intend on using every tool the legislature is willing to give us, including physical castration, to seek justice for the children in our community,"
Chemical castration is the use of drugs to block hormones and decrease sexual desire. It is generally reversible by stopping the drugs. Surgical castration is a permanent procedure.
Several countries and some U.S. states — including California and Florida — allow for chemical castration for some sex offenders. Surgical castration as a punishment is much more rare.

Article: “Silvio Berlusconi was my first man. I have always found Berlusconi exceptional and fascinating. Even physically. Everyone has their own tastes, and I'm a perfectionist.” Francesca PascalBelfi's guest, in the interview with Francesca Fagnani answers a barrage of questions about her relationship with Silvio Berlusconi.
“I owe him complete gratitude, not only for the opportunity he gave me to realize my dreams. Berlusconi was the most important person. He was the best friend, the father I wanted, the perfect lover, and nothing less than a friend. He was also my teacher. I didn't feel the 49-year age difference until the end of our relationship, which had always been happily open. Obviously I was looking at his cell phone and papers…” he says with a smile.
“The dinner parties he decided to have, whether with beautiful women or not, he always went ahead with. Despite his acquaintances, he never lacked respect for me. I had no need to go elsewhere. I never hid my bisexuality from Berlusconi, and I have not yet become a lesbian… She adds: “He was always a great liberal, and he told me that he was also a bit gay… I didn't need to marry Berlusconi.” “I tried to stay close to him by trying to be myself. Was I being arrogant? I was a crazy, unbearable pain in the ass.”
Talking about starting dating. One evening Pascal receives a phone call from Berlusconi and thinks it is a joke. “I had to call him back but I didn't have money in my cell phone, I didn't have anything. I didn't even have money in my mother's cell phone… I called him for an SOS top-up… I was 20 years old.” “My parents were worried and curious too” when I started dating. “I was still going to do what I thought was right. They couldn’t stop me.”
Talking about “myths”: “It is not true that I got 20 million euros “One time,” then “a million a month… all false.” And Putin’s “mythical Latvia?” It wasn’t real Latvia, it was a painting of Putin’s master bedroom. There was no real bed. Is it disappointment? Me too…”.
to regret? “I couldn't say goodbye. If I get to see him again, I'll give him a big hug.”

Article: West Grey 'ready to fight' to save Durham hospital amidst bed losses
Almost two months ago, the emergency department (ED) at Durham’s Community Hospital started an indefinite evening and overnight closure due to a lack of staff.
“We were guaranteed that [the emergency department] would stay as 12 hours, and doing this would solve our issues. 45 days later, ‘Oh no, we’re going to take out the beds now,’” said a frustrated West Grey Mayor Kevin Eccles.
On April 24, the South Bruce Grey Health Centre (SBGHC) said an “intensified” nursing shortage requires 10 Durham inpatient beds to be transferred to hospitals in Walkerton and Kincardine.
Durham’s ED will remain open for 12 hours a day, and diagnostic imaging and lab services will remain, but many in the Durham community fear losing their only inpatient beds means their hospital is in danger of closing.
“Tiny steps towards the end. We can see it,” said Save the Durham Hospital group member Kris Kennedy.
At a special council meeting Tuesday, West Grey council agreed to fight the bed losses and seek legal advice on how best to keep the Durham hospital open.

"The citizens here need to be serviced for our healthcare needs, not have their healthcare needs taken away from them,” said West Grey resident Christine Robinson, who was at Tuesday’s standing-room only special council meeting.
SBGHC officials say they have no plans to close Durham’s hospital, and the bed transitions slated to take place June 3 out of Durham are necessary due to chronic and worsening nursing shortages.
“Our priority is to ensure the delivery of safe and high-quality care, and we will continue to work with both the Ministry of Health and Ontario Health to ensure services are maintained across all SBGHC sites,” said SBGHC President and CEO Nancy Shaw.
SBGHC said they plan to hold town hall meetings about the Durham hospital changes in the near future.

However, the community isn’t waiting. They’re hosting a public meeting at Durham’s arena on May 7 to let everyone know that they don’t want their hospital to close.
“It’s just an important component of our community. And we don’t want to lose it, and we shouldn’t be losing it,” said Kennedy.
“The hospital needs to remain open, the beds needs to stay here, and our ER needs to be enhanced, back to 24-hour care,” said Robinson.
“We’re proud of what we have here and we’re not going to let it go,” said Eccles.
Kennedy said this is the third time over the past 60 years that Durham’s Hospital has been in danger of closing.
The last two times, community pressure and innovative solutions kept the hospital open.

Article: SOUTH COVENTRY, Penn. — A Pennsylvania priest has been accused of stealing more than $41,000 from his parish, much of which authorities allege was used to purchase and play cellphone games.
Lawrence Kozak Jr., 51, of Clifton Heights, was arrested Thursday and charged with multiple counts of theft. Prior to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia’s investigation, Kozak was a priest at St. Thomas More Church in South Coventry Township.
A criminal complaint in the case alleges that Kozak used church funds to pay for “an astronomical amount of Apple transactions” over a three-year span.
Records reviewed by law enforcement showed that Kozak used a parish credit card to pay for nearly 2,200 transactions were related to a category of spending identified as “gaming.”
The games Kozak allegedly used the money for included Candy Crush Saga, Mario Kart Tour, Pokémon Go and several slot machine games, the complaint alleges.
The Pennsylvania State Police began investigating Kozak in July 2022 after learning of financial irregularities found in St. Thomas More’s books during a routine audit.
The review determined that Kozak’s Apple ID, which allows a person to pay for purchases via his iPhone, was associated with more than $214,000 in expenses, the document alleges. About $43,000 of those charges were incurred on the parish credit card.
When questioned by police investigators, Kozak explained that both his Apple card and the parish credit card were attached to his Apple ID because of expenses related to work. When gaming, however, he said he would fail to notice when he went beyond the credit left on the Apple card, and that the charges would get “kicked over” to the parish card.
Kozak told investigators he had begun seeing a counselor to deal with his “addictive tendencies,” according to the complaint.
“Kozak expressed feelings of stupidity because he would ‘pay the bottom line’ when it came to his bills,” the document states. “(He) indicated that his father would warn him in reference to this and tell him that he has to look at what he’s paying for.
“Kozak related that he doesn’t do that and that he sees the bottom line and makes a payment.”
The priest said he was “disappointed that he let it get like this, and that there’s no excuse except that he wasn’t paying attention and should have been.”
When asked if he was aware he was improperly using the parish’s credit card, Kozak said he had no memory of ever deliberately doing so. The parish’s business manager disputed that, however, and told detectives that she’d discussed with the priest the need for him to separate his personal expenses and church expenses paid for by the parish card.
The woman also told investigators that Kozak, who opened the church’s mail, would have seen credit card statements that were eight or more pages long because of the number of transactions he had made, the complaint alleges.
In a statement obtained by WPVI in Philadelphia, archdiocese officials said that Kozak has been on administrative leave since November 2022.
“His administrative leave followed a review of Saint Thomas More Parish’s financial activity by the Archdiocesan Office for Parish Services and Support,” the statement reads. “That review resulted in certain expenses and expenditure levels utilizing parish funds being questioned.”
The Archdiocese referred the matter to law enforcement, which ultimately led to the priest’s arrest.
“The Archdiocese and the parish will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as the criminal matter enters its next phase,” church officials said. “Pending the outcome of the criminal prosecution, Father Kozak remains on administrative leave.”

Article: Golden State Warrior Draymond Green and Phoenix Sun's Jusuf Nurkić are not on the best of terms. Their altercation earlier in the season led to Draymond getting suspended for a large swath of the season. With a series sweep at the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night, the Suns were eliminated from the playoffs. Nurkić has never made it past the first round of the playoffs in his career, so this was just another early postseason departure for him. Draymond Green, of course, jumped on the opportunity to trash the Sun's center.
Nurkić has the lowest postseason winning % in league history, with only three wins over his first 20 playoff games. Upon discovering that incredibly bad statistic, Green amused himself by making fun of Nurkić. "Hope that brother gets the help he needs," Green wrote beside a slew of frozen-faced emojis on a graphic he posted on Instagram that showed Nurkić's postseason problems. The Quote is what Nurkić said of Green after his suspension.
Draymond Green Doesn't Hold Back On Jusuf Nurkic
Despite Green's Warriors' elimination in the play-in round, he didn't hold back in taking a shot at Nurkić. Their feud is far from over and will probably be revisited next season. After falling to the Sacramento Kings in the play-in tournament, the Golden State Warriors were eliminated from the postseason. Following the defeat, Nurkic tweeted a picture of the well-known Looney Tunes phrase, "That's all, folks." Green didn't forget that tweet and had some fun with it.
The Phoenix Suns were run off the court by the Timberwolves. Where they go from here is anyone's guess. Devin Booker might be looking to move to the Big Apple. Kevin Durant is in the later stages of his career. The Golden State Warriors are in a similarly alarming situation, but at least they have Steph Curry and four rings to lean on. Overall, we can't wait to see what the next altercation between Draymond and Jusuf Nurkić looks like.

Sen. JD Vance, an Ohio Republican who is among the contenders to be Donald Trump’s vice presidential running mate, will help the former president raise money next month in Cincinnati, according to an invitation obtained Tuesday by NBC News.
Vance is billed as the "special guest" for a May 15 fundraiser and "lunch discussion" to be headlined by Trump. Host committee members are being asked to contribute or raise $250,000 per couple. For attendees, the amounts are $100,000 per couple or $50,000 per person. All funds will go to the Trump 47 joint fundraising committee.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.
The event could be a trial of sorts for Vance, a first-term senator who lives in Cincinnati and has been a top Trump ally in Ohio. Eight years ago, during his first run for president, Trump made a show of auditioning potential running mates at rallies before settling on then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.
Such public spectacles have yet to materialize in Trump’s third White House bid. The former president has been tied up in his hush money trial in New York and unable to campaign as much, though he has rallies scheduled for Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan, two Midwest battlegrounds.
Ohio is not the presidential swing state it used to be — Trump won it in 2016 and 2020 by 8 percentage points.
Trump forged a relationship with Vance, 39, after endorsing him in a crowded 2022 Senate primary. More recently, they joined forces in Ohio on behalf of former car dealer Bernie Moreno, who won the GOP Senate primary this year after the former president headlined a rally for him in the closing days of the race. Vance threw himself into the primary by courting high-level donors and helping to shore up money for the rally, which was hosted by the pro-Moreno Buckeye Values PAC.
Moreno will face Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown this fall in what is expected to be one of the most competitive Senate races in the country.
In an appearance Sunday on Fox News, Vance said he has not spoken with Trump about the vice presidency but that he would "seriously think about it" if asked to join the presumptive GOP nominee's ticket.
Vance is among several vice presidential prospects scheduled to appear this weekend at a Trump 47 spring retreat in Palm Beach, Fla. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina, Govs. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Kristi Noem of South Dakota, and Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York are also expected at the event.

Article: Galena, a 6-year-old house cat from Utah, likes hiding and playing with cardboard.
Earlier this month, the combination of the two made for a stressful trip in an Amazon package, a feverish search, a California rescue and a tearful reunion.
Her family is still waiting to “reintroduce cardboard to her again," owner Carrie Clark said Tuesday, because they don't want to stress her out.
Clark got Galena as a kitten after her aunt rescued a pregnant feral cat. The American short hair with calico and Siamese coloring has been a constant companion and source of emotional support.
“I’ve been through a bunch of health things and she and I have gone through all of that together. And she’s she just has this extra great part about her personality that’s very loving. And she can tell when you don’t feel well,” Clark said. “And she's just really, really special to me.”
So when Galena disappeared on April 10, Clark was beside herself.
They searched the neighborhood, put up flyers and posted notices on Facebook lost pet pages in Lehi, Utah.
“Not knowing what had happened to her was pretty excruciating," Clark said, “I cried my eyes out for seven days trying to figure out what had happened.” Clark also ran through all the worst-case scenarios, wondering if the cat could have gotten out of the house and been nabbed by a predator or run over by a vehicle.
Clark said she received a “text that changed my life” on April 17, saying that Galena's microchip had been scanned, so Clark knew she had been found somewhere. Soon after, she got a call saying her cat was near Riverside, California, after being found in a box along with steel-toed boots that had been returned to an Amazon warehouse.
Clark's husband had ordered several pairs of boots, kept one and returned the rest in a large box on April 10.
“We realized that that our sweet kitty must have jumped into that box without us knowing,” she said.
Amazon employees knew just who to call when they found the feline — co-worker Brandy Hunter, who rescues cats, Clark said.
Hunter took the cat home and to the vet the next day, where the microchip was scanned.
Clark spoke with Hunter who “calmed me down and told me that my kitty was OK," despite having spent six days in a cardboard box without food or water.
“I wanted desperately to be with her,” Clark said. She and her husband flew to California the next day, reunited with Galena at the veterinarian's office and rented a car to drive home.
“We did what we needed to do because I just adore her,” Clark said.
It was an intensely emotional week.
“I went from hysterically laughing that she was stuck like that — we mailed our cat — you know ... just the humor part of that, to hysterically crying all within like five seconds," Clark said.
The family was lucky to get Galena back, Clark said, in part because the weather was not harsh during the time the cat was missing, the box was torn at a seam, allowing her to get more air, and because Hunter who took her to a vet and had her scanned for a microchip.
Since word got out, Clark has been sharing her cat's story, with advice to microchip your pets and to double-check your Amazon boxes before returning them.
Galena is a quiet cat, Clark said.
“She didn’t meow," Clark said. "We would have loved for her to meow so we knew that she was,” in the box.

Article: Earlier this week, Kim Kardashian took to Instagram. As is almost always the case what she delivered left people talking though it wasn't for any provocative reason this time. It had more to do with the fact that she debuted a new hair look. Sporting an otherwise all black and largely skin tight fit, her new pink hair pops out of the collection of pictures she shared. Anytime a celebrity as big as Kim K makes a fashion change it's going to be big news and her new hair color was no different.
Fans piled into her comment section sharing their thoughts on the new look. That included some fellow celebs, like Khloe Kardashian, showing love. But it also included quite a few Kanye West fans attempting to bring up the rapper's new wife Bianca Censori. "It’s giving kaynes gf if it was nude nylon" one comment reads. "I couldn't tell if this was his ex wife or his current wife" another comment agrees. Since Censori isn't particularly known for pink hair or the type of black fit Kardashian is sporting, it's hard to see when West's fans are talking about. Check out the post she shared and all the fan reactions in the comments below.
Fans React To Kim Kardashian's New Hair Color
Much of the recent discussion of Kim has surrounded Taylor Swift. The second disc of Swift's critically maligned new record The Tortured Poets Department features a diss track aimed at Kardashian. Their beef was sort of inherited from a conflict Swift already had with Kanye West.
While Kim K hasn't said much about Taylor at any point in the past few years, Swift continues to bring it up. The new song follows an award show speech last year that many claimed was directed at Kardashian. What do you think of Kim Kardashian's new pink hair color? Do you think the most recent photo dump she posted to Instagram reminds you of Bianca Censori? Let us know in the comment section below.

Article: Lyndon Joel Cosgriff-Flax, a 22-year-old Petty Officer 3rd Class in the U.S. Navy from Wichita, died during a training exercise Sunday in Virginia, authorities said.
He enlisted in August 2021.
The incident occurred shortly after 8 p.m. at the Naval Weapons Station Yorktown in Yorktown, Virginia, a spokesperson for the naval base said.
A harbor security boat team assigned to the base was “conducting security boat training, a familiarization of the York River,” the Navy said. “During this training event ... Lyndon Joel Cosgriff-Flax accidentally fell overboard resulting in fatal injuries.”
Cosgriff-Flax arrived at the base on February 2022. The Navy is investigating his death.

Article: TAMPA - At Soul de Cuba Café in Seminole Heights, brothers Jesus and Robert Puerto have food to serve and a story to tell.
"I wait for them to have the first bite of their meal, and then they get it," says Jesus.
What they get in food and photos is a uniquely Tampa story of how our food came from a melting pot of immigrant cigar workers who came from everywhere to invent eclectic Ybor City flavors.
"Instead of serving that crab enchila over rice, you serve it over pasta because you have the Sicilian influence. So you have Cuba, Tampa, Afro-Cuban, Sicilian all coming together," says Jesus.
It’s the food that cigar workers ate to sustain their bodies.
"But also their spirituality and their traditions, which were rooted in African, indigenous Cuban, and Roman Catholic traditions," says Jesus.
There’s a huge photo of the Harvest Ball on Nov. 2 1944. Segregated Black people came together at their own club in Ybor.
"It was the place where Black America and Black Cuba met," says Jesus.
He was born in Tampa, but after he suffered a near fatal case of Meningitis in 1993, Jesus went off to the Peace Corps, worked for the United Nations, Paul Newman’s charities, and opened a similar restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut. However, his dream in recent years was to return to his roots and serve his grandmother’s recipes that tell Tampa’s story.
"The story needs to be here because there are a lot of changes going on in Tampa," says Jesus.
They’re making sure that Old Tampa is remembered, from how it looked to how it tasted.
"And we’re able to tell that story one plate at a time," says Jesus.
Soul de Cuba Cafe is at 6428 N Florida Ave., in Tampa’s Seminole Heights neighborhood.

Article: BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — (AP) — When interviewed about his plans after a shock electoral victory last fall, Argentina's President-elect Javier Milei gave his go-to answer in a blink: "To exterminate inflation."
“After that ..." he trailed off, as though searching for anything else that could possibly matter. “Life,” he said, shrugging.
Driven by a single-minded obsession with slashing spending to tame inflation — now nearing 300% — the former television commentator with just two years' experience in Congress made clear from the start he had little interest in anything but economic deregulation.
But the all-or-nothing approach has left the short-tempered libertarian economist without a single legislative achievement 142 days into his presidency, raising questions about whether he can pull off his promised free-market revolution to rescue Argentina from its worst economic crisis in two decades.
Milei, who ran against "thieving politicians," has run into resistance from Argentina's combustible Congress, which he calls "the rat's nest." His proposals have been rejected by political rivals, who he calls "parasites." And he is struggling to win over disgruntled governors, who he reportedly threatened to "piss on" in a meeting last month.
But now, experts say, Milei is wising up to the game, giving up some campaign promises while maneuvering to secure enough other priorities to claim victory.
“He has had a rapid education in Machiavellian operations,” said Christopher Ecclestone, a strategist with investment bank Hallgarten & Company. “He's now using carrots and sticks to get what he wants.”
Indeed he got what he wanted Tuesday, when Argentina's lower house voted to approve a dramatically downsized version of Milei’s economic overhaul package, known as the omnibus bill. The Senate still needs to approve the legislation. Crowds of protestors converged outside Congress.
“Ending 100 years of decadence is not going to be easy but together we will break with the status quo,” Milei said in a rare message of unity after the vote.
Here's a look at the bill that got initial approval — and what it means for Argentina and its self-proclaimed “anarcho-capitalist" leader.
The first thing Milei did as president was crank out an emergency decree that allowed him to ram through hundreds of dramatic changes without Congressional oversight.
In just a few months, Milei devalued the Argentine peso by 54%, removed price controls for food and rent, froze all public works projects, halved the number of federal ministries, slashed government revenue transfers to provinces, cut fuel and transportation subsidies and laid off 15,000 state workers.
Milei claimed “a new era of prosperity” last week when Argentina logged its first quarterly fiscal surplus since 2008. He stabilized the peso's black market exchange rate after months of free-fall. Bond prices climbed.
But that's little comfort to poor and middle-class Argentines struggling to scrape by as prices rise and wages lose value. Over 40% of Argentines now live below the poverty line. Community kitchens say they're overwhelmed.
“I am forced to ask for donations because I can't afford clothes for my son,” said 37-year-old Alicia Martinez in Villa 31, an impoverished neighborhood in central Buenos Aires. “I don't know how much more I can take."
Milei may have won the run-off election with 56% vote share last November, but experts say no Argentine president has had less clout in Congress since the 1983 fall of Argentina’s military dictatorship.
“He is the weakest president in institutional terms that Argentina has ever seen,” said Ana Iparraguirre, partner at Washington-based political strategy firm GBAO.
Founded in 2021, his libertarian party, Freedom Advances, holds just 15% of seats in the lower house and 10% of the senate. None of Argentina's 23 powerful provincial governors — who hold keys to legislative support — are allies.
Milei is fighting two battles in Congress — one over his emergency decree and the other over his cornerstone omnibus bill.
Argentina's senate struck down the presidential decree last month on the grounds it was unconstitutional. The decree remains in force until the lower house rejects it. But some judges have already suspended legislative chapters deregulating the labor market following union petitions.
The omnibus bill cleared its first hurdle Tuesday. But the 232 articles that passed look radically different from Milei’s original 664-article version.
After opposition lawmakers rejected key proposals earlier this year, Milei moderated his tone and entered weeks of negotiations with mainstream right-wing and centrist parties. Ultimately, he was forced to scrap the bill's most controversial elements.
The omnibus bill remains divisive largely for granting Milei vast legislative powers in energy, tax, pensions, security and other areas.
But gone are the measures that could have bankrupted Argentina's powerful trade unions by eliminating automatic dues. Gone are the most extreme privatization plans that would have sold off Argentina's national bank and largest oil company.
In further concessions, Milei agreed he wouldn’t eliminate certain state agencies he has largely defunded, like Argentina’s national film institute and leading research body. To win over cash-strapped governors, Milei lowered salary thresholds subject to income tax.
“He presents himself as an uncompromising radical thinker but when push comes to shove, he is perfectly able to make compromises,” said Eugenia Mitchelstein, associate professor of politics at Argentina's University of San Andrés. “His 100-day honeymoon has come and gone ... He needs this law to pass.”
So far, Milei's has powered his state overhaul with little more than a whirring chainsaw.
The International Monetary Fund expects Argentina's economy to shrink by 2.8% this year. Businesses are firing. Argentines are cutting back on consumption, stoking fears of a recession.
Milei is betting foreign investment can help Argentina turn the corner. But first he needs to show investors — and show the IMF, to which Argentina owes $44 billion — “that he can govern,” said Lucas Romero, who leads the consultancy Synopsis.
Economy Minister Luis Caputo seemed to recognize that during his remarks Monday at the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange addressed to businessmen.
“Our economic recovery depends on how successful we are in convincing you,” he said.

Article: Suge Knight is a polarizing figure in hip-hop. He's the bodyguard who co-founded Death Row Records. He was the driver of the car when 2Pac got shot. He's currently behind bars for voluntary manslaughter, and won't be eligible for parole until 2034. He does, however, have opinions on the Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar beef. Knight hopped on X (formerly Twitter) to share his thoughts on Lamar's long-awaited diss record, "Euphoria." His response was predictable in some ways, yet surprising in others.
For starters, Knight came out as pro K. Dot. Not one single hip-hop fan in surprised to hear this. "Round one goes to Kendrick Lamar," he tweeted. It was the rest of the post that caught fans off guard. Knight, a notoriously violent criminal, decided to use the Drake vs. Lamar beef as a platform to condemn colorism and violence within the Black community.
Suge Knight Condemned The Colorism In K. Dot's Diss
This was sparked, presumably, by the ongoing mockery of Drake for being light-skinned, and therefore not as authentic as Lamar. "Youngin let’s stop saying light skinned people aren’t black," Knight asserted. "Cause the police think otherwise. Black is Black. That creates division amongst ourselves, and I ain’t f**kin with that." Some X users commended Knight for speaking out on the topic, but others criticized him for being a hypocrite given his past indiscretions. Then there those who simply wanted to know why Knight had access to X.
Those who have been plugged into the Drake vs Lamar beef know, however, that Suge Knight has been giving his opinion the whole time. He was extremely critical of Drake for using an AI-generated 2Pac on the diss record "Taylor Made Freestyle." He even dedicated a segment to it on his podcast Collect Calls. "Putting him on a song and dissing Kendrick for everybody entertainment-- that ain’t how it go," Knight asserted. "Then putting him on a song with Snoop, who was a part of his downfall and exit, ain’t ever a good look. He never was a pawn."
Do you agree with Suge Knight's take? Is Kendrick up 1-0?

Article: An informant, police tracking of vehicles and an undercover officer helped lead to five people who are now charged with copper wire theft from St. Paul streetlights with an estimated repair cost to the city of more than $200,000, according to recently filed criminal complaints.
In another case charged Friday, St. Paul police discovered 45 damaged streetlights with an estimated repair cost of $225,000.
St. Paul spent $1.2 million last year on repair and replacement due to wire theft and accompanying damage to streetlights and traffic signals, compared with $250,000 in 2019, according to the city. Electric car chargers, window air-conditioning systems and other infrastructure has also been targeted.
The Ramsey County attorney’s office made accusations against six St. Paul residents in charges filed Friday. The criminal complaints give the following information from prosecutors:
Police received information in January from an informant that Kyaw Klay, 40, organized a crew who went out and damaged streetlights, removing wire from them. An attorney for Kyaw Klay couldn’t be reached Tuesday.
Kyaw Klay and Paw Hkee La, 21, then sold the wire to recycling facilities, including Dem-Con Metal Recycling in Blaine, the informant said.
Dem-Con paid about $3 per pound for copper wiring that had been removed from its insulation and $2 per pound for such wiring that was stamped with “City of St. Paul Public Works” on its insulation.
Dem-Con Metal Recycling is part of the scrap alert network “and we take it very seriously,” said Erik Schuck, the company’s chief operating officer, on Tuesday. “In particular, we were working with the authorities … on this and we are glad to see that these individuals have been apprehended.”
Officers conducted surveillance and saw Kyaw Klay and two others went to Dem-Con on Feb. 5 and sold 127 pounds of copper for $387.
“Kyaw Klay was so familiar to employees at Dem-Con that they no longer asked him for his identification when he brought copper in to sell to them,” the complaint said. State law specifies that scrap metal dealers must make a record of every purchase of scrap metal, which includes getting a copy of the seller’s ID.
Schuck said he couldn’t comment on specific allegations in the complaint.
Kyaw Klay completed 31 transactions with Dem-Con between Nov. 10 and Jan. 15, receiving $12,169 in total.
Undercover officer, vehicle tracking
An undercover officer made arrangements for Kyaw Klay to sell “stolen” copper wire to Dem-Con on his behalf, with the officer telling the man he would get half the money from the sale. The officer was provided with copper wire from the department’s property room that had “City of St. Paul Public Works” stamped on its insulation.
The officer went with Kyaw Klay and Paw La on Feb. 7 to Dem-Con. An employee accepted stripped copper wires that Kyaw Klay brought and the undercover officer’s wire marked with “City of St. Paul,” and Kyaw Klay wasn’t asked to show his ID.
The informant previously told police that Kyaw Klay collected the stolen wire in a Toyota Camry and police obtained a warrant to put a tracking device on the car. On Feb. 16 about 12:45 a.m., officers tracked the car to the area of Mississippi River Boulevard and Dayton Avenue.
Officers on surveillance saw several people cutting wire from streetlights on the Marshall Avenue-Lake Street Bridge and later from streetlights near Marshall Avenue and Mississippi River Boulevard. About 25 streetlights were found damaged, with wires cut and removed, in the area of the Marshall Avenue-Lake Street Bridge. The estimate to repair them is about $125,000.
Police stopped the Toyota Camry and identified Kyaw Klay as the driver and Paw La as the front seat passenger. Eh Tha Blay, 25, and Aye Mae, 42, were the backseat passengers.
Police obtained another tracker warrant for a different Toyota Camry. Officers saw that car parked near the Highland Aquatic Center at 12:20 a.m. Feb. 23 and found 17 damaged streetlights around the pool with the wire cut from them. It’s an estimated $85,000 to repair those lights.
Police pulled over the Camry, and identified the driver as Nay Thar, 36, and the passenger as Eh Blay.
There was cut copper wire at Eh Blay’s feet. Police arrested the pair and Eh Blay told investigators he makes money by following friends who pull copper wire from light poles. He said no one in the car stole wire that night and he had tools because he fixes vehicles.
The Ramsey County attorney’s office charged Eh Blay, Kyaw Klay, Paw La, Aye Mae and Nay Thar on Friday with aiding and abetting energy or telecom damage, first-degree criminal damage to property and possession of burglary or theft tools.
Warner Road lights
Also charged Friday with the same offenses was Gay Gay, 44. Officers conducting surveillance on Feb. 23 saw Gay Gay walking by the Mississippi River, carrying a large bag and stopping near inoperable streetlights, according to the complaint against him.
Police found him parked in Lower Landing Park on Warner Road at 2:25 a.m. There was a large amount of cut copper wire in the vehicle, the complaint said.
Investigators found more than 45 streetlights along Warner Road had fresh damage and copper wire stripped from them. It’s an estimated $225,000 to repair them.
Five of the six people, with the exception of Aye Mae, have been charged with similar offenses this year.
Two St. Paul legislators are sponsoring bills that would require anyone selling copper metal to have a state-issued license. Construction contractors, people who work in residential trades and other licensed workers would continue to be allowed to sell copper and wouldn’t need a separate license. The bills would still allow residents and businesses to recycle copper materials with scrap metal companies for free.

Article: Throughout her breakthrough across the past few years, sex appeal has always been a part of GloRilla's music. She's no stranger to showing off her good looks in memorable outfits and has become an expert at flexing sensual dance moves in her music videos. That was the case once again with her most recent single "Wanna Be" which features Megan Thee Stallion. The sensual video attached to the song features Megan and Glo throwing their own version of a frat party.
Even though sex appeal has always been part of GloRilla's creative output, she recently made a post speaking out against the very concept. "Mfs luv talking about sex appeal baby f*ck da sex appeal I got DA SEX dats what's gone get ya n*gga took in real life, PUSSY GOOD CHECK ion gotta do allat extra shit Fym you hoes be sexy ash with no walls coochie dry asf f*ck outta here," her profanity-laced tweet reads. Despite her all over the place point, many fans in the replies completely agree with what she's saying. Check out the post and some of the reactions to it below.
GloRilla Fires Off About Sex Appeal
GloRilla is fresh off the release of her new mixtape Ehhthang Ehhthang earlier this month. The project sports the previously mentioned Megan Thee Stallion collaboration alongside appearances from Moneybagg Yo, Kevo Muney, Boston Richey, and Finesse2Tymes. It's her first new project since the Anyways.. Life's Great EP dropped in late 2022.
Earlier this year, GloRilla appeared a few times on the Gangsta Art 2 compilation album for her label CMG. She handles the opening track all by herself and later hops on the posse cut "Wrong One." The track that got the most attention was "Cha Cha Cha" with Fivio Foreign, though for the most part it wasn't exactly positive attention. What do you think of GloRilla;s rant against sex appeal and in favor of having receipts? Do you agree with her take that sex appeal isn't everything? Let us know in the comment section below.

Article: HARARE, Zimbabwe — (AP) — Out with the Zimbabwe dollar, in with the ZiG.
Zimbabwe on Tuesday started circulating a new currency to replace one that has been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people. The ZiG was introduced electronically in early April, but people are now able to use banknotes and coins.
It's the southern African country's latest attempt to halt a long-running currency crisis underlining its persistent economic troubles. The government had previously floated various ideas to replace the Zimbabwe dollar, including introducing gold coins to stem inflation and even trying out a digital currency.
Since it was launched electronically on April 5, the ZiG — short for Zimbabwe Gold and backed by the country's gold reserves — appears to be heading down the same path of mistrust, with some government departments refusing to accept it.
The ZiG is the sixth currency Zimbabwe has used since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the world's worst currency crashes to date. That set off a chaotic series of events: first the U.S. dollar was allowed as legal tender, then banned, then unbanned.
A new “bond note” became legal tender, the Zimbabwe dollar was reintroduced before the gold coins and digital currency were tried.
However, nothing brought any currency stability and the U.S. dollar remains the most trusted for ordinary Zimbabweans.
As the shiny new ZiG banknotes hit the streets, the mistrust was evident.
Kudzanayi Mande, a vegetable trader at the crowded Mbare market in the capital of Harare, said she would rather forgo a sale than accept the ZiG. She was confused, the 56-year-old said.
“Already there is an official exchange rate and a depreciated black market rate, so I will wait a bit to see what its real value is,” she said. "The U.S. dollar is still a safer bet.”
The government has allowed some businesses, such as gas stations, to refuse to accept the ZiG in favor of U.S. dollars. Some departments, like the office that issues and renews passports, accept only U.S. dollars.
At the same time, other businesses are being ordered to only use the ZiG, and face punishment if they don't.
“The government prints the money so it should be the first to accept the currency and everyone else will follow," said Gift Mugano, an economics professor at South Africa’s Durban University of Technology.
“Otherwise it is behaving like someone who feeds on takeaways but wants others to eat the food they cook,” Mugano said. "It becomes suspicious.”
Many in Zimbabwe still remember when a 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollar banknote was printed in 2009 at the height of the hyperinflation to keep up with spiraling prices.
At one point, a loaf of bread cost more than 500 million Zimbabwe dollars. Prices would change from when customers walked into a grocery store to when they lined up to pay at the cash register. Restaurants stopped displaying prices on menus as they would go up over the course of a dinner. People lugged around bags stuffed with banknotes. Savings and pensions became worthless.
Through the ordeals, the greenback remained precious — and highly valued on the black market.
Across Zimbabwe, the U.S. dollar is still widely used, from paying rent and school fees to buying groceries. Many take their local currency earnings to the black market to exchange for dollars since banks don't give out U.S. dollars. Some people stash their U.S. dollars at home.
The government of President Emmerson Mnangagwa has taken a hard-line approach — dozens of black market currency dealers were arrested and have been in pretrial detention for weeks, accused of trying to undermine the new currency. After the ZiG was introduced electronically, bank accounts of some businesses were frozen, accused by the government of rejecting the new currency.
Authorities say they have faith in the ZiG because it's backed by the country's gold reserves. Mnangagwa said in a speech on Monday it was a matter of "our national identity and dignity" to trust the ZiG.
Though some hopeful Zimbabweans headed for the banks Tuesday to get their hands on the new currency, many remained skeptical after two decades of turmoil.
An online news outlet published a political cartoon showing a policeman struggling to hold up a collapsing house with the word ZiG on it.
The caption: “World’s first police backed currency.”

Article: WASHINGTON – Downtown hotels will be hard to come by when the Republican National Convention kicks off in Milwaukee in just over two months.
But members of Wisconsin's convention delegation have secured their rooms.
The state's delegation will stay at the Hampton Inn & Suites just half a mile from Fiserv Forum, the epicenter of the July 15-18 convention, after originally being slated to stay at a hotel in Racine, a Republican Party of Wisconsin spokesman told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this week.
Exactly why the delegation was moved from Racine to the downtown Milwaukee hotel was not entirely clear, though one GOP official told the Journal Sentinel Tuesday the change was made during a back and forth between the Wisconsin delegation and the RNC.
A spokeswoman for the convention Tuesday night said the delegation "significantly reduced their hotel room needs" and dropped additional event space requests, allowing them to stay in Milwaukee. The delegation includes both convention delegates and members of Wisconsin's members of Congress.
The downtown hotel has faced financial trouble in recent years. The Hampton Inn & Suites closed temporarily last May but reopened under new owners — the fourth operators in just over four years.
The Hampton Inn & Suites is just one of many around Milwaukee and southeastern Wisconsin the convention will put to use. Organizers have contracted with 111 hotels in Wisconsin for the RNC, officials told the Journal Sentinel.
Organizers try to keep the members of each state delegation together in a hotel or in neighboring hotels for reasons including the ease of transportation and camaraderie, but figuring out who goes where can be complicated. Some of it has to do with politics.
"Who are good supporters? Who is doing good work in their states? Who are the good actors? Who is working hard? Who is meeting certain deliverables and benchmarks in their states?" Elise Dickens, the chief executive officer for the Republican National Committee, said in March.
Other hotel assignments have not been publicly released.
Alison Dirr of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this report.

Article: Hearing aids are a lifeline for people with some degree of hearing loss. Once you know it's -- or invest in your very first pair -- one thing you may notice is how delicate (and sometimes ) hearing aids are. If you think your hearing aids are beyond help, we've gathered some of the most trusted brands below to help you find your next pair. And when you're ready to clean them, we're here to help you get started there, too.
Since the technology for hearing aids is complicated, it matters which tools and cleaning solutions you use. The buildup of earwax or moisture can damage your hearing aid over time, leading to telltale signs of damage like fading, choppy or distorted sound.
Your hearing aids can also cause a buildup of ear canal debris such as bacteria or excess wax, which can lead to health concerns like irritation or even infection.
For these reasons, it's important to clean your hearing aids regularly -- and to make sure you're occasionally visiting a licensed audiologist or hearing specialist for a professional scrubbing. See our guide below for proper hearing aid cleaning tips and tools.
How to clean your hearing aids
If you want your hearing aids to last, it's important to clean them regularly. Many devices come with a hearing-aid cleaning kit and manufacturer recommendations with tips on how to safely and efficiently clean your hearing aid. Refer to these instructions first to avoid any unnecessary damage or a void on your warranty. Most manufacturer warranties, like the one offered by MDHearing, do not cover damage from excess moisture.
You may be tempted to use water or a damp cloth to clean your hearing aid, but we recommend sticking with cleaning solutions and tools that are approved for use with hearing aids. This is due to the delicate nature of these devices and the technology within them.
Want to keep your hearing aid clean and in tip-top shape? Disinfect and wipe away wax or debris buildup with a microfiber cloth on a nightly basis. We also recommend routinely storing your hearing aid in a dehumidifier overnight to easily prevent moisture buildup.
We also recommend giving hearing aids a more thorough cleaning once per week. Professional cleanings from a licensed hearing aid professional can also make daily upkeep easier, plus it gives you an opportunity to discuss any issues or adjustments. Schedule a professional cleaning once every six months.
What are the best tools for cleaning hearing aids?
If you don't already have a dedicated cleaning kit for your hearing aid, we've got you covered. There are tools you can buy on your own -- separately or as part of a hearing aid cleaning kit -- to keep your devices in good shape.
Some common tools that will get the job done for most, if not all, types of
include:- Hearing aid brush: Commonly found in cleaning kits, this brush is good for cleaning the surface of hearing aids to remove any wax, dirt, or debris.
- Slim tube cleaning tool: Not unlike pipe cleaners, these tools are meant to clean and dust the inside from the tubing of hearing aids. For smaller devices, there are small-scale NanoClean cleaners that can get the job done for tiny tubing.
- Disinfectant spray: These products typically contain ingredients that break down wax buildup. Double check with manufacturer recommendations before buying to make sure a spray solution is safe for your hearing aid.
- Wax loops: These tools can be used to clean earwax from the earpiece that sits in the ear canal, which can block sound transmission over time.
- Microfiber cloth: This type of cloth is best for wiping down everything after cleaning to remove any remaining wax, dust, or debris.
- Dryers and dehumidifiers: There are a variety of drying devices you can buy that are meant to keep hearing aids safe from moisture buildup. Some dryers are fully automatic and use UV lights for a quick clean, such as the effective Kapak disinfection dryer.
How to clean different types of hearing aids
You may be wondering if there is anything specific you should be doing for your hearing aid based on the
you have. There are a variety of hearing aid types out there that range from tiny, discreet devices that sit in your ear (similar to a pair of wireless earbuds) to bulkier hearing aids that house all the important tech in a plastic case that wraps around the ear.Let's break it down into two categories: in-the-ear hearing aids (ITE) and behind-the-ear hearing aids (BTE). Most hearing aids generally fall into one category or the other. Here are some cleaning tips for either type.
ITE hearing aids are fairly straightforward: Use a hearing-aid brush to wipe down the outer portion, move on to a wax loop tool to finish off any stubborn wax buildup, then finish up with a slim tube cleaning tool. Carefully thread it through any and all ventilation tubing. Don't forget to give your device a once-over with a microfiber cloth afterwards. Store your hearing aid in its original case or a dehumidifier overnight as well.
BTE hearing aids can be a bit more involved when it comes to proper cleaning and maintenance. You should still start with a brush for the exterior of the receiver and microphone cover devices, followed by the wax loop. Make sure to brush any additional microphones, which may be located on the back of the hearing aid, as well. If your hearing aid has an ear mold, refer to manufacturer instructions for cleaning it: this will likely include a brief soak in warm, soapy water. Make sure the mold is completely dry before reassembling and using (or storing) the device.
Can I use alcohol wipes on hearing aids?
While it may be tempting to use basic household cleaners like alcohol wipes to clean and disinfect your hearing aid, we recommend against this. Abrasive chemicals that contain ammonia or bleach may damage the plastic casing, which is typically fragile. The tech inside your hearing aid is also very vulnerable to moisture, which can seep into the tiny devices from a damp alcohol wipe, cloth, or an ill-advised spray from a chemical cleaner.

Article: LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers staved off elimination with a must-needed Game 5 victory, but one moment in particular during the game is sparking conversation among NBA fans.
It was business as usual for LeBron James, who helped his Lakers avoid the embarrassment of being swept and blowing another double-digit lead. James led his team with 30 points, five rebounds, four assists, three steals, and one block.
James put on a show in the fourth quarter, scoring 14 points, but it wasn’t without a spectacle. A moment between the 20-time All-Star and his coaching staff caught the attention of viewers watching the game.
During a possession in the 4th quarter with 9:10 remaining, the Denver Nuggets were given possession after it appeared that James poked the ball out of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope’s hands. Replays would show that was not the case, with James urging his head coach, Darvin Ham, to challenge the call, regain possession and build on their double-digit lead.
When that didn’t happen, James jumped up and down in frustration with Coach Ham and his staff, screaming, “Challenge the f*cking play!.” To make matters worse, Jamal Murray scored on a layup, taking advantage of the Lakers’ lack of focus.
Luckily for the purple and gold, that play was not a momentum shifter, and the Lakers protected their lead, something they had failed to do in the previous three games.
Was LeBron Overreacting, or Did Darvin Ham Drop The Ball Coaching Wise?
Reactions to the moment range from Lakers fans siding with James and questioning Darvin Ham’s coaching abilities to others using the moment to call King James a crybaby.
“If Ham is still apart of our organization next season I might stop watching basketball I’m so serious,” one user on X, formerly Twitter wrote.
Another NBA fan wrote, “Lebron is hilarious. 4 rings in 25 years is not a Goat. Goats dont have tantrums either. Lebron doesn’t know that his time has passed and is gone. Retire.”
Regardless, the Lakers will live to fight another day. The gallery below shows more reactions to the moment.

Article: Auftakterfolg für Seubelsdorfer U12 bei der Bayerischen Mannschaftsmeisterschaft der Jugend
Feuerprobe in der Königsklasse
Für Jugendschach ist die Bayerische Mannschaftsmeisterschaft eine Feuerprobe in der Königsklasse. Im Pyramidensystem spielen jeweils vier Teams gegeneinander, von denen nur die zwei besten weiterkommen. Am 27. April begrüßte die U12 des Schachverein Seubelsdorf zum Auftakt den VfB Einberg, den SK Schweinfurt und den SC Erlangen im heimischen Vereinsheim des TV Oberwallenstadt. Jonathan Hewera, Moritz Fiedler, Julian Schmuck und Jan Hoffmann hatten unter Matthias Bergmann hart geübt, doch wirkte der Aufmarsch von Talenten mit teilweise deutlich höheren Wertungszahlen beeindruckend.
In der ersten Runde forderten die Schweinfurter den Gastgeber stark heraus. Hewera spielte geistreich auf Matt und Materialgewinn, verlor jedoch durch ein Übersehen die Qualität und musste nach langer Gegenwehr aufgeben. Schmucks Gegner kannte das Schlagen „en passant“ nicht und verschaffte Schmuck so einen Freibauern. Schmuck konnte ihn aber nicht halten und kam im Bauernendspiel sogar noch unter die Räder.
Trotz 0:2‑Rückstand retteten Fiedler und Hoffmann einen Mannschaftspunkt: Fiedler knöpfte seinem Kontrahenten immer mehr Figuren ab und kam zu einem sicheren Sieg. Hoffmanns beherzter Mattangriff sah sich schon nach wenigen Zügen vom Erfolg gekrönt.
Danach ging es in der zweiten Runde gegen Einberg schon um Alles oder Nichts. Durch druckvolles Spiel verwirrte Hewera seinen Gegner so, dass dieser zwei unmögliche Züge machte und dafür, in bereits verlorener Stellung, „genullt“ wurde. Schmuck ließ es nach einem Figurengewinn ruhig angehen, schlug jedoch blitzschnell zu, als sein Gegner die eigene Königsstellung schwächte, und setzte mit schwungvollem Läuferopfer Matt. Gegenläufig dazu büßte Fiedler zuerst Material ein, fand aber durch taktische Stiche ins Spiel zurück und konnte ebenfalls den gegnerischen König zur Strecke bringen. Hewera besiegelte in überlegener Stellung Unentschieden, um etwas Kraft zu sparen.
Denn in der dritten und letzten Runde wartete der härteste Gegner auf die Seubelsdorfer: Der SC Erlangen hatte die ersten beiden Durchgänge mit 3:1 gewonnen und lag im Schnitt 200 Wertungspunkte über den Gastgebern.
Hewera maß sich an Brett 1 sogar mit einem 300 Punkte stärkeren „Schwergewicht“, brachte seinen Kontrahenten durch eine ausgefallene Eröffnung aber gehörig ins Schwitzen. Zwischendurch hatte Hewera sogar einen Mehrbauern und das freiere Spiel. Nach Ungenauigkeiten übersah er allerdings, dass ein feindlicher Turm inzwischen entfesselt war und ihn jäh mattsetzen konnte.
Auch an Brett 2 hieß es zunächst „Vorteil für Seubelsdorf“, da Fiedler einen Bauern gewonnen hatte. Indessen unterschätzte er einen gegnerischen Läufer, der nicht nur den Bauern zurückgewann, sondern sich auch noch einen ganzen Turm schnappte, was die Partie aussichtslos machte.
An Brett 3 zeigte Schmuck hervorragendes Eröffnungsverständnis, das ihm dabei half, ein erzieltes materielles Übergewicht auch sicher zu verwerten. Nun hing alles an der wechselhaften Partie von Hoffmann an Brett 3: Bald eine Figur im Rückstand, hielt er dem Druck stand und fing seinerseits einen verirrten Springer ein, ja erreichte sogar ein vorteilhaftes Turmendspiel. Der erfahrene Gegner rettete sich nach einigen Abenteuern dann doch in ein Unentschieden. Die nominell überragenden Erlanger setzten sich also mit 1,5:2,5 denkbar knapp durch, was das enorme Potenzial der „jungen Wilden“ von Seubelsdorf zeigt.
Ihr Einsatz lohnte sich zudem nicht nur moralisch, sondern auch sportlich: Mit einem Brettpunkt Vorsprung vor Schweinfurt kamen sie auf den zweiten Platz dieses Umgangs und qualifizierten sich damit für die nächsten drei Runden im Mai.
Grobes Lob aller Beteiligten galt den Helferinnen und Helfern, die das Match bestens bewirteten und für den den immer wieder nötigen Beistand sorgten.

Article: Bamberg Baskets liefern sich mit den Telekom Baskets Bonn über drei Viertel ein spannendes Kräftemessen und musste sich am Ende doch knapp geschlagen geben
Mit den Telekom Baskets Bonn kamen am Dienstagabend der aktuelle Tabellensechste nach Bamberg. Ein Sieg für seine Bonner gehörte für den Bonner HeadCoach Roel Moors eigentlich „zum Pflichtprogramm“; ganz so einfach wurde es aber dann doch nicht.
Die Bamberger erwischten zu Beginn des ersten Viertels zwar den besseren Start, sahen sich aber schnell dem Bollwerk des Tabellensechsten ausgesetzt; der den Turbo anwarf. Kein Wunder also, dass der hauchdünne, erarbeitete „Sechs-Punkte-Vorsprung“ für Bamberg so langsam vor sich hinschmolz. Bonn drehte das Spiel und konnte die Führung zum Ende des ersten Viertels auf 19:25 ausbauen. Auf Bamberger Seite machte im ersten Viertel besonders Justin Gray von sich machen, der sechs Punkte zum aktuellen Spielstand beitrug. Für die Bonner erzielte deren Top-Performer Brian Fobbs, der durchschnittlich bisher 14,2 Punkte pro Spiel erzielte, fünf Punkte bei. So richtig konnte der Bonner HeadCoach Roel Moors bisher mit der Leistung seiner Mannschaft nicht zufrieden sein, wäre da doch bisher mehr drin gewesen. Nach gespielten vier Minuten im zweiten Viertel stand es 26:33 für Bonn. Bambergs Trainer Arne Woltmann holte seine Jungs zu sich nach außen, drohte doch zu diesem Zeitpunkt eine übermächtige Bonner Mannschaft die Führung noch deutlicher auszubauen.
Die Fans der Bamberg Baskets merkten, dass ihre Mannschaft nun die Unterstützung von den Rängen brauchen und peitschten ihre Jungs zu einer Aufholjagd nach vorne. Bamberg wurde stärker.und so konnten die Hausherren den Bonner-Vorsprung „wettmachen“ und erkämpften sich ein zu diesem Zeitpunkt hochverdientes 41:41. Eine Führung gelang den Bambergern zu diesem Zeitpunkt aber noch nicht. Mit einem knappen Vorsprung von 41:46 für die Gäste aus Bonn ging es dann – nach einem spannenden zweiten Viertel – in die Halbzeitpause. Für die drei Unparteiischen, die zum Ende des zweiten Viertels mit einigen fragwürdigen Entscheidungen negativ in den Fokus der Bamberger Fans rückten, gab es ein lautstarkes Pfeifkonzert von den Rängen. Trey Woodbury zählte zu diesem Zeitpunkt zu den Top-Werfern. Er holte zehn der 41 Punkte; dicht gefolgt von Malik Johnson, der acht Punkte erzielte.
Lassen sich die Bamberger das Spiel jetzt aus der Hand nehmen? Die Telekom Baskets kommen frischer aus der Halbzeitpause. Nach gespielten zwei Minuten nach Wiederanpfiff zeigte die Anzeigentafel 43:51 für Bonn. Drei Minuten nach Wiederanpfiff – beim Stand von 45:56 – holte Arne Woltmann seine Jungs abernals zu sich nach draußen, drohte doch, dass der Bonner Vorsprung weiter ausgebaut werden könnte. Aber genau das Gegenteil war der Fall. Bamberg zeigte mehr „Biss“ und „Kampfgeist“ und „schraubte sich Punkt für Punkt an den Gegner heran. 59:61 stand es eineinhalb Minuten vor Ende des dritten Viertels. Es entwickelte sich ein offner Schlagabtausch zwischen beiden Mannschaften, welcher an Spannung nicht zu überwieten war. Mit 62:65 ging es dann in das letzte Viertel. Top-Scorer nach gespielten drei Vierteln auf Bamberger Seite waren Malik Johnson (10) und Trey Woodbury (10).
Wer glaubte: „Mehr Spannung geht nicht; der irrte“. Nach gespielten dreieinhalb Minuten im Schlussviertel stand es 68:70. Die 4066 Besucher sahen ein auf und ab. Bamberg lief immer zu diesem Zeitpunkt immer noch dem Rückstand hinterher. 72:73 stand es nach noch zu spielenden fünf Minuten. 4:55 waren noch zu spielen als Bamberg unter großem Jubel der Fans zum 73:73 ausglich. Geht da noch was für Bamberg? 73:78 rund vier Minuten vor dem Ertönen der Schlusssirene. 75:79 zwei Minuten vor Schluss. „Auf geht‚s Bamberg kämpfen und siegen“; schallte es zum x‑ten Mal durch die Brosearena. Trey Woodbury machte es nochmals spannend als er mit einem Dreier zum 79:81 einnetzte. Am Ende reichte es für Bamberg nicht. Sie mussten sich nach einer kampfbetonten und spannenden Partie knapp mit 79:89 geschlagen geben.
Für Bamberg trafen:
Justin Gray (8), Herzog Lukas (3), Zach Copeland (8), Malik Johnson (13), Adrian Nelson (10), Karsten Tadda (5), Trey Woodbury (13), Patrick Heckmann (4), EJ Onu (5), Filip Stanic (10)

Article: Bayreuther Wissenschaftler arbeiten am sicheren Datenaustausch für die Energiewende
Gemeinsam mit Partnern haben Bayreuther Wirtschaftsinformatiker für die Deutsche Energieagentur (dena) einen sicheren Weg des Datenaustauschs im Energiesystem erarbeitet. Am 25.4. wurde der Bericht „Grundlagen und Bedeutung von Datenräumen für die Energiewirtschaft“ veröffentlicht. Autoren sind Prof. Dr. Jens Strüker und Dr. Marc-Fabian Körner von der Universität Bayreuth.
What for?
Das erklärte Ziel der Dekarbonisierung der Stromversorgung kann nur erreicht werden, indem mehr regenerative Energien dezentral eingespeist werden. Damit werden bisherige Wege der Kraftwerkseinsatzplanung (der sogenannte (Re-)Dispatch, der ausgleicht, wer wann wie viel Strom liefert) nicht mehr ausreichen. Und diese Herausforderung wird größer, je größer die Zahl von einspeisenden Kleinsterzeugungsanlagen wie PV-Anlagen oder Heimspeichern wird. Ein verbesserter Datenaustausch im Energiesystem erzeugt erhebliche Effizienzgewinne und sorgt dafür, dass im System insgesamt weniger Energie gebraucht bzw. weniger Ausgleich von großen Stromschwankungen im Netz notwendig wird. Weil der Netzausgleich heute vor allem von fossilen Kraftwerken geleistet wird, senkt der erhöhte Datenaustausch durch die verbesserte Koordination unmittelbar Treibhausgasemissionen. Daher ist die Arbeit an einem effizienten, sicheren Datenraum zum Datenaustausch vieler Anbieter und Verbraucher ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Energiewende.
Um die notwendigen Strukturen für einen effizienten und sicheren Datenaustausch zwischen allen Partnern im Stromsystem zu erproben, wurde im Projekt dena-ENDA (ENergy DAta Space) eine Referenzarchitektur für einen Energiedatenraum entwickelt und umgesetzt. Das heißt, es wurde ein sicherer virtueller Raum geschaffen, in dem alle Beteiligten an einem dezentralen Stromversorgungsnetz Daten austauschen können, um so Stromschwankungen, Nachfrage- und Erzeugungsanpassungen, den Re-/Dispatch, abzufedern. Das ist nötig, um die Versorgungssicherheit auch mit sich verändernden Rahmenbedingungen zu gewährleisten.
Das Future Energy Lab, das Pilotierungs- und Vernetzungslabor für Digitale Technologien der Deutschen Energie-Agentur (dena), hat in Kooperation mit der ifok GmbH, Bonn Consulting, Fraunhofer FIT und innogence business consulting ein Projekt zur Etablierung von Datenräumen in der Energiewirtschaft umgesetzt. In Zusammenarbeit mit den verschiedenen Akteuren, z.B. Verteilnetzbetreibern, Anlagenbetreibern oder Servicedienstleistern wurden technische Fragestellungen geklärt und eine Datenraum-Architektur entwickelt. Prof. Dr. Jens Strüker, Professor für Wirtschaftsinformatik und Digitales Energiemanagement, und Dr. Marc-Fabian Körner, Postdoc Wirtschaftsinformatik, beide an der Universität Bayreuth und für das FIT tätig, haben das Projekt wissenschaftlich begleitet und den Bericht verfasst.
„Die Energiekrise hat schmerzlich den Mangel an digitalem Datenaustausch in der Energiewirtschaft aufgezeigt: Staatliche Unterstützung konnte nicht zielgenau erfolgen, da Energieverbrauchsdaten ebenso fehlten wie eine durchgängige digitale Kommunikation zwischen Haushalten, Unternehmen auf der Verbraucherseite und Energieversorgern auf der anderen Seite“, berichtet Strüker. „Für den Energiesektor würde ein verbesserter Datenaustausch bedeuten, dass Daten diverser Energieerzeugungs- und Energieverbrauchseinheiten unterschiedlicher Größe unter definierten Richtlinien miteinander geteilt, ausgetauscht und weiterverarbeitet werden können.“ Mit dem nun bekannt gemachten Pilotprojekt wurde erstmals ein solcher Datenraum im deutschen Energiesektor eingerichtet.
Strüker erläutert: „Allgemein ermöglichen Datenräume den souveränen und selbstbestimmten Austausch von Daten über Unternehmensgrenzen hinweg. Sie nutzen bestehende Standards, Technologien und Governance-Modelle der Datenwirtschaft, um Datensicherheit, ‑souveränität, ‑interoperabilität und ‑übertragbarkeit sowie das Vertrauen zwischen den Akteuren in eine faire Software-Infrastruktur zu integrieren. Sie basieren auf einer dezentralen Software-Infrastruktur, die die notwendigen Software-Funktionalitäten innerhalb eines Ökosystems aus Akteuren bereitstellt. Datenräume bieten eine Grundlage zur Entwicklung von Smart Services und innovativen unternehmensübergreifenden Geschäftsprozessen.“
Die Bayreuther Wirtschaftsinformatiker arbeiten übergreifend an der Beantwortung der Frage nach neuen Ansatzmöglichkeiten für eine Echtzeit-Energiewirtschaft und damit für einen effektiven Klimaschutz, um hier einen Beitrag für Umwelt und Gesellschaft zu leisten. Durch die Realisierung von Datenräumen können neue Anwendungsfelder erschlossen und neu gedacht werden, z.B. um die Umsetzung von Energy Communities, d.h. die Optimierung und Umsetzung von Peer-to-Peer-Energiehandel, voranzutreiben oder die Abstimmung der Ladevorgänge von Elektrofahrzeugen auf den lokalen Strommix und Lastprognosen besser abzustimmen.

Article: Emotionaler Saisonabschluss für den VC Eltmann
VCE feiert die Meisterschaft und ein ganz besonderes Jubiläum
Auch wenn der VC Eltmann schon seit dem letzten Heimspiel gegen Kriftel als sicherer Meister der Zweiten Volleyball Bundesliga feststand, feierte der Verein am vergangenem Samstag nochmals gemeinsam mit den heimischen Zuschauern die Meisterschaft, den Derbysieg und ein ganz besonderes Jubiläum. „Wir wollten uns unbedingt mit einem Sieg verabschieden, das Derby für uns entscheiden und zuhause ungeschlagen bleiben. Außerdem wollten wir Rolf noch einen schönen Abend bereiten und die Ehrung für 50 Jahre Volleyball in Eltmann mit einem Sieg krönen.“, so Manager Felix Reschke am Ende eines ereignisreichen und aufregenden Tages.
In einem sportlich nicht immer hochklassigem Spiel, bei dem beiden Mannschaften anzusehen war, dass den Spielern die lange Saison in den Knochen steckt, erwischte der Meister aus Eltmann den besseren Start und konnte sich gleich zu Beginn etwas absetzen. Beim Stande von 13:19 war der erste Satz eigentlich schon entschieden, doch Trainerfuchs Milan Maric fand nochmal die richtigen Worte, motivierte sein Team und sorgte dafür, dass das Spitzenteam aus Schwaig nochmal rankam und sich am Ende nur knapp mit 25:23 geschlagen geben musste. Im zweiten Satz begann der Gast aus Mittelfranken dann konzentrierter und kämpfte sich immer mehr in die Partie. Als die Anzeigetafel dann nur wenig später auf 12:7 für die Schwaiger umsprang, hatte Erfolgstrainer Christian Kranz dann genug gesehen und zog seine erste taktische Auszeit. Mit der idealen Mischung aus Strenge und Einfühlvermögen richtete der smarte und charmante Würzburger dann die richtigen Worte an sein Team, um dieses aufzuwecken und für den Rest des Satzes zu motivieren. „Er findet einfach immer die richtigen Worte und weiß einfach, wie er mit uns umgehen muss. Während der eine Spieler einen Tritt in den Allerwertesten braucht, brauchen manche Spieler manchmal einfach nur ein paar warme Worte und eine zärtliche Umarmung.“, so Diagonalspieler Jannis Hopt, der seinem Coach eine angenehm straffe Führung attestiert. Wenig später hatte der Aufsteiger die Partie dann auch schon auf den Kopf gestellt und konnte sich die Führung kurz vor Ende zurückerkämpfen. Nach etwa 23 Minuten hieß es dann 25:20 aus Sicht der Unterfranken, bevor sich beide Teams dann in eine denkwürdige zehnminütige Satzpause verabschiedeten. Diese Pause wurde dann jedoch nicht wie üblich dazu genutzt, sich nochmals zu besprechen und sich taktisch neu zu sortieren, sondern galt voll und ganz der Ehrung der Vereinslegende Rolf Werner. „Das war schon ein sehr emotionaler Moment und es war schön, dass nicht nur die Spieler und Verantwortlichen der diesjährigen Saison, sondern ich den schönen Moment auch mit Freunden, meiner Familie und ehemaligen Wegbegleitern teilen durfte.“, so das jetzige VCE Ehrenmitglied auf Lebenszeit. Besonders zu erwähnen sei an dieser Stelle die schöne Geste vom Gästetrainer Milan Maric, der es sich nicht nehmen ließ, ein paar emotionale Worte an Werner zu richten und auf die Ansprache an die eigenen Mannen verzichtete. „Das zeigt einfach nochmal, was für ein sympathischer Mensch er ist und dass wir hier in Franken einen sehr engen Zusammenhalt pflegen, was das ganze Tagesgeschäft sehr viel erträglicher und angenehmer für alle gestaltet.“, so Manager Reschke, der den letzten Part der Laudatio übernahm, ehe sich beide Mannschaften für den letzten Abschnitt der Partie vorbereiten durften.
Im letzten Abschnitt schien es, als hätte die emotionale Pause etwas den Wind aus den Eltmanner Segeln genommen und wie bereits im zweiten Satz waren es erstmal die Gäste, die besser ins Spiel fanden und sich eine knappe Führung herausspielen konnten. Wie man es aber mittlerweile vom Meister aus Eltmann gewohnt ist, kämpfte sich der Spitzenreiter zurück in die Partie und ließ keinen Zweifel daran, dass man das Match heute glatt in drei Sätzen für sich entscheiden möchte. Um 20:33 Uhr war es dann auch endlich so weit und die die Freude auf Seiten der Gastgeber kannte keiner Grenzen mehr als die Schiedsrichterin das Match beim Stande von 25:22 für den VCE abpfiff und offiziell beendete.
Was danach folgte war grenzenloser Jubel und pure Erleichterung in den Gesichtern der Spieler, Trainer und Verantwortlichen.
Nachdem alle Beteiligten Ihre Medaille erhalten hatten, stemmte Kapitän Johannes Engel dann endlich den Meisterpokal in die Höhe und sorgte dafür, dass sich die Georg-Schäfer-Halle noch einmal in ein echtes Tollhaus verwandelte. Zudem wurde am Rande der Feierlichkeiten noch bekannt gegeben, dass der VC Eltmann nicht nur als Titelverteidiger in die neue Zweitligasaison starten wird, sondern zudem auch unter einem neuen Namen antreten wird. Hauptsponsor Reiner Dümpert war sichtlich begeistert und veröffentlichte nur einen kurzen Moment darauf den neuen Namen „CERATONIA Volleys Eltmann“.
Was danach geschah, wo die Feier endete und welcher Spieler in welchem Zustand wo schlief, konnten wir leider bis Redaktionsschluss nicht herausfinden und es kann nur spekuliert werden, was sich in der Nacht von Samstag auf Sonntag in Eltmann, Bamberg und dem Rest Frankens noch abgespielt haben könnte.

Article: erlanger linke: „Richtigstellung zu Aussage von OB Janik über Mehrheitsverhältnissen zur StUB im Stadtrat“
Laut dem Artikel „Kulturkampf um die Stadt-Umland-Bahn“ der Erlanger Nachrichten vom 17.04.2024 behauptet der Erlanger Oberbürgermeister Florian Janik, es habe seit den letzten Stadtratswahlen keine Mehrheit „für die StUB“ gegeben. Dazu erklärt Johannes Pöhlmann, Vorsitzender der erlanger linke und ehemaliger Stadtrat:
„Der Erlanger Oberbürgermeister irrt. Seit den Kommunalwahlen 2020 gibt es eine Mehrheit für den Bau der Stadt-Umland-Bahn. SPD, Grüne Liste und Klimaliste unterstützen nach eigenen Aussagen die StUB, das sind 24 Stimmen im Stadtrat. Auch wir als erlanger linke befürworten den Bau der StUB grundsätzlich, das macht 26 Stimmen und somit eine absolute Mehrheit. Lediglich die von der Stadtregierung durchgesetzte Trassenführung hat im Stadtrat keine Mehrheit. Indem trotz förderfähiger Alternativen nur die umstrittene dritte Talquerung des Wiesengrunds beim Bürgerentscheid zur Wahl gestellt wird, wird die StUB insgesamt gefährdet.“

Article: FCE Bamberg braucht im „Abstiegskracher“ am Samstag volle Unterstützung
„Am Samstag alle ins Stadion“
Spannender kann der Kampf gegen den Abstieg in der Regionalliga Bayern kaum sein: Drei Spieltage vor Saisonende treffen die „Domreiter“ am Samstag, 4. Mai um 14 Uhr im Fuchs-Park-Stadion in einem „Do or Die“-Spiel auf den FC Memmingen. Beide Mannschaften trennen nur wenige Punkte, beide müssen unbedingt gewinnen, um das rettende Ufer noch zu erreichen.
Die Bamberger gehen in diese wegweisende Partie mit breiter Brust: Nach dem Sieg im letzten Heimspiel gegen den SV Schalding-Heining gelang der Truppe von Jan Gernlein am vergangenen Samstag ein weiteres Husarenstück: ein Auswärtssieg beim Tabellenzweiten in Vilzing.
„Die beiden letzten Spiele und Siege waren für uns überlebenswichtig“, betont Bambergs Fußball-Abteilungsleiter Sascha Dorsch. „Das war auch Balsam auf die Wunden aus den vorherigen Spiele, in denen wir nicht an unsere Leistungsgrenze gekommen sind. Nun haben wir das Gefühl, dass wir rechtzeitig zur ‚Crunchtime‘ fit sind und wollen unbedingt gegen Memmingen den dritten Erfolg in Serie einfahren.“
Klar ist: Gewinnen die Bamberger diese Partie, haben sie die direkten Abstiegsplätze erst einmal hinter sich gelassen – bei einer Niederlage ist Zittern bis zum letzten Spieltag angesagt. Deshalb bitten die Domreiter um Unterstützung der Fußballfans aus der gesamten Region am Samstag im Fuchs-Park-Stadion. „Alle ins Stadion“ lautet das Motto.
Als Anreiz gibt es zwei besondere Aktionen: Treue Vereinsmitglieder erhalten bis zu 5 Freitickets für die Gegengerade, um die Mannschaft nach vorne zu peitschen. Einfach eine kurze E‑Mail mit Vorname, Name und Anschrift an s.dorsch@fce2010.de
Außerdem verlost der FCE 1 x 2 Tickets für die neue „Sky VIP Lounge“ direkt unter dem Stadiondach, inklusive Catering und Besuch der Pressekonferenz. Bis 2. Mai (12 Uhr) kann sich jede und jeder ebenfalls per E‑Mail bewerben an info@fce2010.de

Article: Geldabholer nach Schockanruf in Hirschaid verhaftet
Gemeinsame Pressemitteilung des Polizeipräsidiums Oberfranken und der Staatsanwaltschaft Bamberg
Am Freitag haben Schockanrufer versucht, eine 65-jährige Frau aus Hirschaid um einen hohen fünfstelligen Geldbetrag zu bringen. Die Frau erkannte jedoch die Masche und half so, den Geldabholer festzunehmen. Ein Richter erließ am Samstag auf Antrag der Staatsanwaltschaft Bamberg Haftbefehl.
Am Freitagmittag riefen Unbekannte die 65-jährige Frau aus Hirschaid an. Die Anrufer schilderten ihr, dass ihre Tochter in einen tödlichen Verkehrsunfall verwickelt sei. Sie müsse deshalb eine Kaution in Höhe von 22.000 Euro aufbringen, um einen Gefängnisaufenthalt abzuwenden. Die Frau erkannte die Masche und ließ sofort die Polizei informieren. So konnten mehrere Streifen der Verkehrspolizei, des Zentralen Ergänzungsdienstes und der Kriminalpolizei Bamberg den Geldabholer am Freitagnachmittag festnehmen. Es handelt sich hierbei um einen 21-jährigen polnischen Staatsangehörigen.
Der Mann muss sich nun wegen des versuchten banden- und gewerbsmäßigen Betruges verantworten. Auf Antrag der Staatsanwaltschaft Bamberg erließ ein Richter am Samstag Haftbefehl. Der 21-Jährige sitzt inzwischen in einer Justizvollzugsanstalt ein.

Article: MdB Silberhorn lädt zu einem Jahr in den USA ein
Zu einem Jahr in den USA lädt MdB Thomas Silberhorn (CSU) Schülerinnen und Schüler sowie junge Berufstätige ein. Der Bundestagsabgeordnete für Bamberg und Forchheim unterstützt auch in diesem Jahr das Parlamentarische Patenschaftsprogramm zwischen Deutschem Bundestag und US-Kongress.
„Für Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene ist das Austauschprogramm ideal, um internationale Erfahrungen zu sammeln und als Botschafter für die Region Bamberg in die USA zu gehen“, erklärt Silberhorn, Sprecher der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion für Transatlantische Beziehungen.
Jedes Jahr ermöglicht das Parlamentarische Patenschaftsprogramm des Deutschen Bundestags und des US-Kongresses Stipendiatinnen und Stipendiaten aus Deutschland ein Jahr in den USA zu verbringen. Sie leben in Gastfamilien, besuchen eine High School und machen ein Praktikum oder arbeiten in einem amerikanischen Betrieb. Zeitgleich sind junge US-Amerikaner zu Gast in Deutschland, um hier Kultur, Alltag und Politik kennenzulernen. Die Kosten für Reise, Unterkunft und Versicherung werden von den beiden Parlamenten getragen.
Bewerbungen für das Programmjahr 2025/2026 sind ab dem 2. Mai bis zum 13. September 2024 unter www.bundestag.de/ppp möglich.

Article: Philip Jalalpoor beendet seine Bayreuther Spielerkarriere
Nach 25 Jahren im Leistungssport hat sich der Kapitän des BBC Bayreuth entschieden, seine Spielerkarriere zu beenden und eine neue Herausforderung als Trainer anzunehmen. Der 30-Jährige kehrt an die Universität von Vancouver (UBC) zurück, wo er bereits seinen Bachelor-Abschluss gemacht hat, und wird dort ab sofort hauptberuflich als Assistenztrainer arbeiten.
Philip war als Spieler in 7 Ländern aktiv und absolvierte insgesamt 87 Spiele für medi bayreuth und den BBC Bayreuth. Höhepunkt der Karriere des Deutsch-Iraners war die Teilnahme an den Olympischen Spielen 2020 in Tokio.
Philip Jalalpoor: „Nach langen Überlegungen habe ich mich mit meiner Familie dazu entschieden, einen neuen Weg einzuschlagen. Diese Entscheidung ist uns nicht leicht gefallen, da wir vor allem seitens der Fans des BBC Bayreuth und dem gesamten Umfeld wahnsinnig viel Unterstützung erfahren haben. Diese einmalige Gelegenheit ermöglicht es mir, meiner Leidenschaft für Basketball auch nach meiner aktiven Karriere weiter auf höchstem Niveau nachgehen zu können, weshalb ich zu diesem Entschluss gekommen bin. Wir werden Bayreuth immer in sehr guter Erinnerung behalten.“
In der vergangenen Saison hat Philip auf dem Spielfeld eine wichtige Führungsrolle übernommen und sich abseits des Feldes als Trainer im Nachwuchsbereich engagiert und in Zusammenarbeit mit ISPEX ein Nachhaltigkeitskonzept für den BBC Bayreuth entwickelt.
Friedrich Hartung: „Philip ist ein Vorbild für jeden Mitspieler und alle Nachwuchsspieler. Er hat auf dem Feld immer alles gegeben und neben dem Feld seine Erfahrungen geteilt. Natürlich hätten wir Philip auch weiterhin gerne in der Oberfrankenhalle gesehen, aber diese Chance hat er sich erarbeitet und absolut verdient. Im Namen der gesamten Organisation bedanke ich mich deshalb für sein Engagement und wünsche Philip beruflich und privat alles gute für die Zukunft.“

Autofahrt wegen Drogenkonsum gestoppt
Ein 21 Jahre alter Autofahrer wurde am Dienstag nach 01.00 Uhr in Adelsdorf einer Verkehrskontrolle unterzogen. Dabei stellten die Beamten der Polizeiinspektion Höchstadt a.d. Aisch Hinweise auf Drogenkonsum fest und veranlassten eine Blutentnahme bei dem Mann. Bei einem Nachweis von Drogen im Blut drohen ihm ein Fahrverbot von mindestens einem Monat und 500 Euro Geldbuße. Die Fahrt war am Kontrollort erst einmal zu Ende.
Schmierereien
Im Weingartsgraben und An der Steige in Höchstadt wurden in der Zeit von Samstag 20.00 Uhr bis Sonntag 12.00 Uhr ein Haus und ein Omnibus von unbekannten Tätern mit schwarzer und roter Farbe besprüht.

Unfallflucht
In der Zeit von Sonntag 18.00 Uhr bis Montag 04.30 Uhr wurde das Gebäude des Supermarktes REWE in Röttenbach durch ein Fahrzeug massiv beschädigt, wobei der Verursacher davonfuhr und sich nicht um die Schadenregulierung kümmerte. Der Schaden wird mit 5000 Euro angegeben. Die Polizeiinspektion Höchstadt ermittelt deshalb wegen unerlaubten Entfernens vom Unfallort und bittet um sachdienliche Hinweise aus der Bevölkerung. Bei dem Fahrzeug des Unfallfahrers dürfte es sich, ersten Erkenntnissen zufolge, um einen Mini Modell F oder R 55/56 handeln, der im Frontbereich einen deutlichen Schaden haben dürfte.

Erneuter Sieg in der Ferne
Beim dritten Auswärtsspiel in Folge konnte die Spielgemeinschaft den dritten Sieg einfahren und sich damit erneut ein Stück von den Abstiegsplätzen absetzen.
Dabei erwischte die Porzelt-Elf den besseren Start und hatte die erste Gelegenheit durch Sophia Huberth. Darauf hatte Carina Nögel die Führung auf dem Fuß, doch nach einer Ecke von Natascha Porzelt stand die Latte im Weg (5.). Danach kam die Heimmannschaft besser in die Partie, wohingegen die Gäste zu ungeduldig agierten und teilweise unkonzentriert wirkten. Zweimal wurde es dabei gefährlich vor dem SG-Tor. Vor allem in der 34. Spielminute hatte die SG Glück, als Laura Mönch einen Schnitzer in Burks Hintermannschaft nicht ausnutzen konnte und das Spielgerät hauchdünn am Tor vorbeisetzte. Nach einem der nun selteneren Angriffe über Burks linke Angriffsseite flankte Porzelt in die Mitte, wo Selina Pelch goldrichtig stand und zur umjubelten Führung einnetzen konnte (39.). Diese knappe Führung konnte die SG in die Pause retten.
Kurz nach der Halbzeit wurde Pelch von Alexandra Loukas auf die Reise geschickt. Den Abschluss von Pelch aus halbrechter Position konnte Torhüterin Franziska Engelhardt sehenswert zur Ecke lenken (51.). Nach einer Serie an darauffolgenden Eckbällen fiel dann das 2:0 aus Sicht der Gäste. Dabei brachte Porzelt das Spielgerät in die Mitte, wo Loukas wuchtig einköpfte (55.). Danach verflachte der Spielverlauf wieder. Gegen Ende der Partie wurde es dann etwas hitzig. Leider ließ sich auch der Schiedsrichter von den Kommentaren von Außen beirren. Leidtragend waren dabei die Spielerinnen der SG, als vor allem in zwei Situationen sehr zweifelhaft gegen die Gäste entschieden wurde. In der 86. Minute fiel dann die Entscheidung nach erneutem Porzelt-Eckball. Wieder kam Loukas an den Ball, deren Schuss noch abgeblockt werden konnte Letztendlich traf dann eine Heimakteurin ins eigene Tor zum 0:3‑Endstand.

Eine 0:3‑Niederlage, die schon nach 26 Minuten feststand, musste die SpVgg Bayreuth heute Abend in der Regionalliga Bayern bei den Würzburger Kickers hinnehmen.
Im ersten Spiel nach seiner Beförderung zum offiziellen Cheftrainer konnte Lukas Kling außer den Langzeitverletzten Tim Latteier und Jonas Kehl sowie den beiden erkrankten Jakub Mintal und Tobias Weber auf den vollen Kader zurückgreifen. Auch David Ismail war nach seiner Verletzungspause wieder im Aufgebot.
Die bereits als Regionalligameister feststehenden Würzburger und die Altstadt, die einen einstelligen Tabellenplatz als aktuelles Saisonziel ausgegeben hat, lieferten sich von Anfang an eine muntere Partie. In der 18. Minute hatten die Gastgeber eine erste Chance durch Dardan Kamiani, SpVgg-Keeper Lucas Zahaczewski war jedoch zur Stelle. Besser machte es drei Minuten später Benyas Solomon Junge-Abiol, der nach einer Flanke von Maximilian Zaiser zur 1:0‑Führung für die Kickers einköpfte (21.).
Jetzt sollte es schnell gehen: In der 24. Minute schickte Saliou Sane Dardan Karimani auf die Reise, der frei vor Lucas Zahaczewski die Nerven behielt und zum 2:0 für die Gastgeber einschob. Nur zwei Minuten später erhöhte Dominik Meisel nach toller Vorarbeit von Kapitän Peter Kurzweg auf 3:0 (26.)
Lukas Kling reagierte mit zwei Auswechslungen, Patrick Scheder kam für Bohdan Potalov und Eduard Heckmann für Daniel Haubner. In der 38. Minute hatte Edwin Schwarz die große Chance zum Anschlusstreffer, Kickers-Torwart Vincent Friedsam klärte jedoch mit einer Parade zur Ecke. Kurz darauf klärte Edwin Schwarz im letzten Moment bei einer scharfen Hereingabe von Peter Kurzweg. Mit der 3:0‑Führung der klar besseren Unterfranken ging es schließlich in die Halbzeitpause.
In der 51. Minute musste die SpVgg einen weiteren Nackenschlag hinnehmen: Marco Zietsch sah nach einem Foulspiel die Gelb-Rote Karte. In Überzahl hatten die Kickers die Partie vor 1.621 Zuschauern weiter fest im Griff und konnten souverän agieren. In der 69. Minute hatte der gerade eingewechselte Benjika Caciel aus kurzer Distanz eine Kopfballchance für die Würzburger, verfehlte aber das Gehäuse. In der 88. Minute setzte Benyas Solomon Junge-Abiol den Ball nach einer Hereingabe von Benjica Caciel knapp über den Bayreuther Kasten.
Letztlich blieb es beim 3:0‑Sieg der Gastgeber. Die Altstadt hat nach 32 Spielen jetzt weiter 41 Punkte auf dem Konto. “Es war wahrlich kein gutes Spiel von uns. Wir hatten gehofft, dass das Team nach der Sicherstellung des Klassenerhalts befreit nach vorne aufspielt und vielleicht einen Punkt mitnimmt, dies haben wir aber nicht ansatzweise geschafft. Nach dem ersten Gegentreffer haben wir die Ordnung verloren und nicht mehr wiedergefunden. Binnen fünf Minuten ging es Schlag auf Schlag und es stand 0:3. Dann kam in der 51. Minute noch die Gelb-Rote Karte gegen Marco Zietsch, die uns endgültig das Genick brach. Im Mittelfeld fehlte uns etwas die ordnende Hand. Mit der Einwechslung einiger Nachwuchskräfte hat unser Trainer dann noch einen gewissen Fingerzeig in die Zukunft gegeben. Letztlich sah man einfach, wer der Regionalligameister ist”, analysierte SpVgg-Geschäftsführer Jörg Schmalfuß nach der Partie.

Article: Vorabend-Demo der Jugendorganisationen zum Tag der Arbeit in Erlangen
In Erlangen sind heute schon am Vorabend des 1. Mai die Jugendorganisationen der Gewerkschaften zusammen mit den Jusos, der Jungen Linken und der Grünen Jugend auf die Straße gegangen.
Unter dem Motto „Reiche zur Kasse, Kampf für die Klasse“ forderten die Redner*innen mehr bezahlbaren Wohnraum, mehr Investitionen in die Bildungs- und Sozialpolitik, Mitbestimmung von Beschäftigten, die Abschaffung der Schuldenbremse und eine Zivilklausel für Universitäten. Im Kern der Forderungen standen außerdem höhere Löhne und mehr Tarifbindung.
Außerdem zeigten die Redebeiträge sich solidarisch mit den Beschäftigten der KSG in Erlangen, die aufgrund ihres Einsatzes für bessere Arbeitsbedingungen fristlos gekündigt wurden. Auch sie kamen bei der Abschlusskundgebung vor der Uniklinik im Ulmenweg zu Wort.

Article: Bamberger Landkreisbier „36 Kreisla“ wird ein Export naturtrüb
Im Jubiläumsjahr brauen vier Brauereien der Gemeinde Memmelsdorf den Gerstensaft des Landkreises
Im zehnten Jahr seines Bestehens werden vier Brauereien aus der Gemeinde Memmelsdorf das „36 Kreisla“ brauen: Hummel (Merkendorf), Höhn (Memmelsdorf), Drei Kronen (Memmelsdorf) und Göller (Drosendorf). „Damit haben sich bereits mehr als die Hälfte unserer 65 Brauereien an dem Gemeinschaftsprojekt beteiligt“, ist Landrat Johann Kalb stolz auf die Brautradition im Bamberger Land.
„Der Gerstensaft im Jubiläumsjahr wird ein ‚Export naturtrüb‘ werden.“ Das hat der Landrat in dieser Woche mit den Verantwortlichen der vier Brauereien Isabella Mereien, Julius und Georg Hummel, Jonas Göller und Georg Höhn vereinbart. Ende Juli soll das diesjährige „36 Kreisla“ eingebraut werden. Der Anstich erfolgt jedes Jahr traditionell am sogenannten „Brauersilvester“, am 30. September.
Der Landkreis Bamberg ist von einer über die Jahrhunderte gewachsenen Bierkultur geprägt, die sich in der höchsten Privatbrauereidichte weltweit widerspiegelt. Noch heute existieren 65 Brauereien im Landkreis, meist familiengeführt, handwerklich geprägt und vielfältig im Angebot ihrer Biersorten. Um diese weltweit einmalige Vielfalt zu erhalten und zu stärken, hatte Landrat Johann Kalb 2014 die Idee, ein eigenes Landkreisbier zu entwickeln. 2021 gewinnt das Landkreisbier die „Goldene BierIdee“. Die Auszeichnung würdigt Personen oder Initiativen, die sich in besonderer Weise um die Präsentation bayerischer Bierspezialitäten verdient gemacht haben.

Article: Christine Neubauer kommt nach Eckental ins Kino
Die CASINO Lichtspiele Eckental zeigen am 2. Mai den Film „Hundswut“, eine bayerische Produktion.
Die Schauspielerin Christine Neubauer, der Regisseur Daniel Alvarenga und weitere Crew Mitglieder kommen im Rahmen einer Kinotour zu uns nach Eckental.
Es gibt zwei Veranstaltungen um 16:15 Uhr und um 19:30 Uhr ( bereits ausgebucht)
Kurzinhalt „Hundswut“
In einem bayerischen Dorf von 1932 geschehen grausame Morde. Der Gemeinderat schiebt die Tat einem tollwütigen Wolf zu, um die Dorfbewohner zu beruhigen. Als Gerüchte über einen menschlichen oder gar werwolfähnlichen Mörder aufkommen, wird der Einsiedler Joseph Köhler als Verdächtiger verhaftet. Als er hartnäckig bestreitet, die Taten begangen zu haben, eskaliert die Stimmung und gipfelt schließlich in Gewalt. Die Frauen des Dorfes setzen alles daran, dem irrationalen Wahnsinn der eigentlich vernünftigen Dorfbewohner entgegenzutreten. Inspiriert von einem der letzten dokumentierten Hexenprozesse und eingebettet in die unruhige Ära kurz vor dem Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkriegs entfaltet der Film eine zeitlose Intensität, obwohl seine Handlung vor beinahe 100 Jahren angesiedelt ist

Article: Neue Aktionen von „Buntes Bamberg“ zur Europawahl
Brandmauer, Bierdeckel und überparteilicher Wahlaufruf Mai 2024
Im Vorfeld der Europawahlen plant Buntes Bamberg eine Reihe von Aktionen. Wir wollen damit das Bewusstsein für unsere demokratischen Werte, für Vielfalt, Toleranz und respektvolles Miteinander stärken – und wir wollen gleichzeitig für die Gefahr sensibilisieren, die von populistischen Kräften, Falschinformationen und rechtsextremer Hetze ausgeht.
Ab dem 4. Mai kann man sich in der Bamberger Fußgängerzone über alle Parteien informieren, die zur Europawahl antreten.
Wir sind auch wieder am Start, um mit unserer Brandmauer gegen Rechts daran zu erinnern: Vorsicht vor populistischen Parolen, scheinbar einfachen Antworten, Falschinformationen und rechter Hetze. Wählt Demokratie, wählt eine demokratische Partei! Wer ab dem 5. Mai eine Bamberger Gaststätte oder ein Café besucht, könnte dort unsere „Vielfalt“-Bierfilzchen vorfinden.
Die Idee entstand, als die AfD begann, Stammtische in Lokalen in und um Bamberg abzuhalten. Ziel ist eine friedliche Protestform gemeinsam mit den Betreiber*innen. Und nun können alle interessierten Gaststätten ein Paket von uns anfordern.
Am 5. Mai verteilen wir zudem Pakete in den Gaststätten in der Innenstadt.
In den teilnehmenden Lokalen können ab dann alle Gäste darauf anstoßen, dass Bamberg ist ein Ort der Vielfalt und der Toleranz ist und bleibt.
In Zusammenarbeit mit fast aller demokratischen Bamberger Fraktionen, Parteien und vieler Organisationen der Zivilgesellschaft ist ein Aufruf entstanden, wählen zu gehen, aber demokratisch.
Demokratisch wählen – Aufruf zur Europawahl
Wahltermin: 9. Juni 2024
Wir leben in einem demokratischen Land, mit Grundrechten, die für alle Menschen gelten, insbesondere Meinungsfreiheit und Pressefreiheit. All das ist nicht selbstverständlich, und aktuell wieder bedroht von radikalen Kräften.
Unsere Demokratie ist wehrhaft – allerdings nur, solange sie existiert. Wird eine Demokratie auf demokratischem Weg abgewählt, verschwinden die Möglichkeiten, sie zurückzubringen, oder auch nur das neue System zu kritisieren, meist als erstes.
Was als Protestwahl beginnt, kann als Diktatur enden. Was geschieht, wenn ein System autokratisch wird, sah man 1933 in Deutschland. Man sieht es beispielsweise in Russland oder in Iran. Wie schnell eine stabile Demokratie ins Wanken geraten kann, sieht man u.a. in den USA und in Israel.
Wir leben in einer Zeit von Krisen und Wandel. Frust und Wut sind verständlich. Aber unsere Freiheit und unsere Rechte aufs Spiel zu setzen ist nicht die Antwort.
Aus Protest oder Unzufriedenheit heraus eine in Teilen gesichert rechtsextremistische Partei wie die AfD zu unterstützen, ist keine konstruktive Form von Kritik, politischem Diskurs oder freier Meinungsäußerung. Es ist der Anfang vom Ende dieser Freiheiten.
Parteien, die Prinzipien wie die Würde und die Gleichheit aller Menschen nicht würdigen, können nicht als demokratisch gelten.
Gehen Sie am 9. Juni wählen. Aber wählen Sie demokratisch. Damit Sie auch in Zukunft noch wählen dürfen.
Schulterschluss für Demokratie!

Article: Vortrag „Besser leben ohne Plastik“ in der Forchheimer Stadtbücherei
Referentin Nadine Schubert gab viele Tipps
Veranstaltung zum Earthday 2024 – BLoP – Besser leben ohne Plastik
Frau Nadine Schubert hat sich bereits 2013 entschlossen, ihren Haushalt plastikfrei zu machen und hat diese Entwicklung mit inzwischen 3 Sachbüchern begleitet. Ihre Erfahrungen teilt sie gerne mit und möchte am liebsten gute Nachrichten verbreiten. Der perfekt plastikfreie Haushalt bleibt weiter ihr Ziel. Es ist aber auch klar, dass es in unserer Gesellschaft völlig ohne Kunststoffe nicht mehr geht. Es lohnt sich aber „gutes“ von
„schlechtem“ Plastik zu unterscheiden. „Gutes“ zeichnet sich durch lange Nutzungsdauer aus, diesem sollte man deshalb einen Wert geben. Wenn möglich sollte man besonders Elektrogeräte reparieren lassen, z.B. im Reparatur Café´ im Zukunftshaus in Forchheim. Je kürzer die Nutzungsdauer ist (50 % der Kunststoffprodukte landen immerhin nach weniger als einem Monat im Müll), desto mehr sollte es vermieden werden. „Schlechtes“ Plastik, das man z.B. riechen kann sollte man keinesfalls erwerben, denn es gast Schadstoffe aus. Das belastet die Gesundheit.
Die Kunststoffproduktion sollte bis 2040 dringend reduziert werden, besser für uns Menschen wäre eine Reduktion um 60%. Als Beispiel für schlechtes und damit nicht nötiges Plastik nennt Frau Schubert u.a. beschichtete Bäckertüten. Ein kleiner Backbetrieb verbraucht davon 63.000 Stück im Jahr. Das lässt sich einsparen, indem man zum Bäcker einen Stoffbeutel mitbringt. Der beste Lagerplatz für Backwaren zu Hause ist nach ihrer Ansicht der Backofen. Bezüglich Reinigungs- und Körperpflegemitteln gibt Frau Schubert viele kostengünstige Rezepte auf Kernseifenbasis weiter. Damit vermeiden wir große Mengen an Mikroplastik, das inzwischen auch in vielen menschlichen Organen nachgewiesen ist. Die zahlreichen Plastik-Einspar-Tipps und Rezepte sind in Frau Schuberts Fachbüchern nachzulesen, inzwischen gibt es auch eines für die Jüngsten. Wir als Verbraucher können mit unseren Kaufentscheidungen für Änderungen in Richtung Kreislaufwirtschaft beitragen. Frau Schubert rät deshalb, statt bei großen Geschäften lieber in kleinen Läden, z.B. Unverpackt-Läden einzukaufen, regional und saisonal. Damit wird unser Geld bei „Bessermachern“ ausgegeben.

Article: Werfer der UAC Kulmbach/TSV Stadtsteinach auf dem Werfertag in Wiesau
Am Samstag den 27. April fand in Wiesau bei Sonnenschein, aber kühlem Wind der traditionelle Werfertag statt, zu dem 123 Athlet:innen aus 21 Vereinen angetreten sind. Die Werfer der Trainingsgruppe des UAC Kulmbach/TSV Stadtsteinach waren mit 10 Personen aller Altersklassen vertreten.
Neben erfahrenen Athleten waren in den jüngsten Altersgruppen der W12 Valerie Hacker und bei den Jungs Jamie Schulz in seinem ersten Wettkampf in der Altersklasse M13 am Start. Valerie schraubte ihre Bestweite im Hammerwurf mit dem 2 kg ‑Wurfgerät auf eine neue persönliche Bestleistung von beachtlichen 38,01 Metern, Jamie wuchtete seinen 3 kg-Schweren Hammer mit eineinhalb Drehungen auf 30,81 Meter, was ihm neben dem Tagessieg in dieser Altersklasse auch den ersten Platz in der aktuellen bayerischen Bestenliste einbrachte. Auch der 750 g schwere Diskus flog mit 20,45 Metern über die 20 Meter-Marke.
Eintragen auf Platz 2 in die Deutsche Bestenliste im Hammerwurf der Altersklasse M15 durfte sich Kai Konopacki, der den Wettbewerb mit persönlicher Bestleistung von 53,40 Meter vor Oliver Ispan vom TSV Plattling mit 49,21 Metern gewann. In der nächsthöheren Altersklasse U18, in der die 16 und 17 Jährigen antreten, waren die Kulmbach / Stadtsteinacher Werfer durch Matti Hummel im Hammerwurf und Diskus vertreten, der mit dem 5 kg Hammer auf 62,82 Meter warf, wobei deutlich weitere Versuche leider nicht im Sektor landeten und ungültig waren. Der Diskus flog 44,28 Meter, was Platz 2 hinter Christof Zierer aus Plattling (47,25 m) bedeutete, der dafür im Hammerwurfduell mit einer Weite von 32,80 Metern den deutlich kürzeren Wurf hatte.
Einen guten dritten Paltz sicherte sich Paul Hensen im Kugelstossen der U20 mit 11,36 m. Ebenfalls in der U20 startete der aus Staffelstein stammende Max Hübner, der den Sieg im Speerwurf mit 54,81 Meter sowie Platz eins im Hammerwurf (45,74 m) ebenfalls in die Trainingsgruppe holte.
Die für den UAC startende, amtierende Bayerische Winter-Speerwurf Meisterin Alina Schütz musste sich im Speerwurf der Frauen mit Platz 3 begnügen, holte sich dann allerdings im Kugelstossen mit fast einem halben Meter Vorsprung auf die Zweitplatzierte Nele Ganßmüller von der LG Fichtelgebirge mit einem Stoss auf 10,97 Meter in dieser Disziplin den Sieg.
Im Hammerwerfen der Frauen gingen die Plätze 1 mit 52,18 Meter an Leonie Liebenwald und 3 mit 37,06 Meter an Margitta Grötsch ebenfalls nach Oberfranken.
Der Bruder von Leonie, Linus Liebenwald holte sich mit einer Weite von 58,94 Metern in seinem ersten Jahr mit dem 7,26 kg schweren Wurfgerät Platz 1 vor dem deutlich älteren Andreas Bauer aus Burglengenfeld.

Article: Wie schafft Wladimir Putin es, die Geschichte zu verdrehen und seine grausamen Taten mit Wörtern anzudeuten und später zu rechtfertigen? Ein Experte erklärt die Strategie hinter der Sprache des russischen Herrschers. Live. In Farbe. Hier in Greifswald. Der webmoritz. berichtet von Prof. Nicolosis Vortrag am Alfried Krupp Wissenschaftskolleg.
Der 24. Februar 2022 ist der Tag, an dem Undenkbares und überwunden Geglaubtes plötzlich erschütternd echte Realität wird. Russland überfällt nach Befehl von Machthaber Wladimir Putin die Ukraine. Eine “militärische Spezialoperation”, die sich in einen bis heute andauernden, schrecklichen Krieg verwandelt. Am frühen Morgen jenes 24. Februars hält Präsident Putin eine Ansprache, in der er seinen Befehl versucht zu begründen, zu legitimieren und eine Botschaft an die Welt zu senden.
Doch wie schafft er es, seine Sicht der Geschehnisse zu verbreiten? Welche klassischen Elemente der Kriegsrhetorik finden sich bei ihm wieder? Und warum sollte man sich angesichts der grausamen Folgen des Angriffs überhaupt mit so etwas Banalem wie Rhetorik befassen? Antworten auf diese Fragen gab Prof. Riccardo Nicolosi am Montagabend (15.04.) in seinem Vortrag “Putins Kriegsrhetorik” im Greifswalder Alfried Krupp Wissenschaftskolleg. Die gut besuchte Veranstaltung war der Auftakt der Fellow Lectures des Kollegs, die Zuhörer*innen im ganzen Sommersemester spannende Einblicke in verschiedenste Forschungsgebiete eröffnet.
Putin ist kein begnadeter Redner
Prof. Nicolosi stellt zu Beginn direkt klar, was Putin nicht ist: ein begnadeter Redner. Er sei oberlehrerhaft, anstrengend und wenig charismatisch. Er bewegt die Massen nicht. Er überzeugt nicht in Debatten. Er kann bei Großveranstaltungen nicht mitreißen. Warum? Weil er es nicht nötig hat. Bevor der Präsident auch nur sein erstes Wort spricht, hat er Vorkehrungen getroffen, die den „Erfolg“ seiner Rede garantieren sollen. Putin, so Nicolosi, meide Reden vor großen Menschenmassen auf öffentlichen Plätzen. Wer keine demokratische Wahl hat, muss sich auch nicht, wie beispielsweise Merkel 2013, in einem TV-Kanzlerduell den überaus stechenden Fragen eines Stefan Raab stellen. So eine öffentliche Debatte gibt es in Russland, in dessen Inland laut Nicolosi in den vergangenen zwei Jahren noch repressiver und totalitärer agiert wird, schlichtweg nicht. Und selbst wenn Putin sich in einer Fernsehsendung Fragen eines Publikums stellt, sind die Personen sowie deren Fragen selbstverständlich zuvor abgesprochen. Diese Inszenierung diene nur dazu, eine Nähe des Herrschers zu seinem Volk zu suggerieren, erläutert Nicolosi.
Sind die passenden Voraussetzungen geschaffen, kann Putin seine Botschaften verkünden. Dazu bedient er sich verschiedener rhetorischer Mittel. Aber was ist Rhetorik überhaupt? Nicolosi erläutert diesen Grundstein seines Vortrags mit dem antiken griechischen Philosoph Platon. Laut diesem ist Rhetorik eine „ethische Überzeugungskunst zur Konsensbildung“. Eine demokratische Kunst also. Aber nicht in Russland. Dort gibt es keine Konsensbildung. Putin ist der Konsens.
“Die Kunst der Rhetorik ist laut Platon eigentlich eine demokratische Kunst.”
Prof. Riccardo Nicolosi
Die Subform der Kriegsrhetorik ist eine spezielle, wird sie doch nur im Ausnahmezustand genutzt. Laut Nicolosi kreiert diese Rhetorik einen begrenzten Möglichkeitshorizont, in dem Gewaltanwendung legitimiert wird. Was heißt das konkret? Putin stellt sein Land allgemein als ewiges Opfer des Westens dar, welcher eine ständige Bedrohung für das Fortbestehen Russlands sei. Er geht dabei weit in die Geschichte zurück und behauptet, der Westen wolle Revanche für die Niederlage Napoleons im Jahre 1812 (!). Bemerkenswert: In seiner 30-minütigen Rede am 24. Februar 2022 erwähnt Putin die Ukraine in den ersten 15 Minuten nicht ein einziges Mal. In genannter Rede bedient er sich laut Nicolosi klassischer Mittel der Kriegsrhetorik, die schon viele Tyrannen und Herrscher vor ihm verwendeten.
Zu Beginn gibt es die sogenannte Justification Speech, die dazu dient, die Entstehung der Situation zu erläutern und das Vorgehen zu legitimieren. Putin schildert seine Sicht der Vergangenheit, indem er auf einen angeblichen Genozid an der russischsprachigen Bevölkerung im Donbas, in der Ostukraine, verweist. Das leitet auf das nächste Stilmittel ein: die Alternativlosigkeit des Handelns. Der Genozid müsse gestoppt werden, bevor es zu spät ist. Die „ukrainischen Neonazis“ müssten aufgehalten werden. Nicolosi erklärt, dass der Begriff Nazi in Putins Sprachgebrauch generell einen tyrannischen Feind beschreibt und nichts mehr viel mit der eigentlichen Nazi-Ideologie gemein habe. Zum Schluss seiner Rede zu Kriegsbeginn erwähnt Putin zudem klassisch die Siegessicherheit der „Militäroperation“, die die Führung in Kiew ersetzen und eigentlich nur wenige Tage andauern sollte.
Warum sollte man sich überhaupt mit Putins Rhetorik beschäftigen?
Nicolosi ist es wichtig, die Relevanz des Vortragsthemas hervorzuheben. Die Sprache Putins war der Aggressivität seiner Taten immer mindestens einen Schritt voraus. Putin habe in seinen Reden in den vergangenen Jahren immer wieder undeutlich ausgesprochen, dass eine Intervention in der Ukraine nötig sei. Bereits 2014 deutete er dies in seiner „Blut und Boden“ Rede sehr bildhaft an: „Wenn man eine Feder immer weiter zusammendrückt, wird sie irgendwann mit aller Kraft auseinanderspringen“. Damit spielt er auf die Zeit nach dem Fall der Sowjetunion an, in der er Entwicklungen wie die NATO-Osterweiterung beobachten musste, die für ihn und sein Land eine „Demütigung“ seien.
“9 von 10 Russen haben wahrscheinlich noch nie eine Rede Putins gesehen”
Prof. Riccardo Nicolosi
Die Bezeichnung der „militärischen Spezialoperation“ wählt Putin nicht ohne Grund, wie Nicolosi erklärt. Eine Spezialoperation könne man abbrechen, wenn das Ziel erreicht sei. Einen Krieg könne man nur gewinnen oder verlieren. Hoffnung, dass diese Spezialoperation wirklich zeitnah beendet wird, lässt sich daraus aber wohl nicht schöpfen.
Zum Abschluss der Veranstaltung konnte das Publikum Fragen an Professor Nicolosi stellen. Besonders die Frage nach der Wirksamkeit der Reden stand dabei im Zentrum. Nicolosi stellte klar, dass 9 von 10 Bürgern Russlands wahrscheinlich nie eine Rede Putins verfolgt hätten. Ihnen sei auch völlig unklar, was Putin mit Begriffen wie „Entnazifizierung“ überhaupt meine. Es sind programmatische Reden. Putin sei kein Populist, so Nicolosi. Er wolle den Willen der Massen nicht auf sich ziehen. Das stehe ganz im Gegensatz zu jemandem wie Trump, der sich in einem ständigen Wahlkampfmodus befinde.
Nicolosi gelang es in seinem Vortrag, Putins Rhetorik wissenschaftlich einzuordnen und die Zuhörer an ihrem Wissensstand abzuholen. Sein Fachwissen über die Sprache und das russische System trugen zu einer überaus interessanten Abendveranstaltung bei.

Man habe sehr deutlich gemacht, «dass die Arbeit der Universität nicht endlos durch Demonstranten gestört werden kann, die gegen die Regeln verstoßen. Wenn dies weiterhin geschieht, wird dies klare Konsequenzen nach sich ziehen», hieß es in einer Stellungnahme der Hochschule.
Den Dutzenden Studierenden, die die Hamilton Hall besetzt hielten, drohe der Ausschluss. Auch das Weiße Haus übte deutliche Kritik am Vorgehen der Demonstrantinnen und Demonstranten, die gegen Israels Vorgehen im Gaza-Krieg und die Unterstützung des jüdischen Staates durch die US-Regierung protestieren.
Die seit knapp zwei Wochen andauernden Proteste an der Universität in der liberalen Ostküstenmetropole New York waren eskaliert. Demonstrierende drangen in die Hamilton Hall auf dem Campus im Norden Manhattans ein, die schon 1968 während eines Protests gegen den Vietnam-Krieg besetzt worden war.
Protestwelle im ganzen Land
Auch andere Universitäten sind längst von der Protestwelle erfasst worden. Laut US-Medien wurden seit Beginn der Unmutsbekundungen im ganzen Land mehr als 1000 Demonstranten vorläufig festgenommen – gestern griff die Polizei unter anderem in den Bundesstaaten Kalifornien, Georgia und North Carolina ein.
Am Montag hatte die Columbia-Universität angekündigt, Studentinnen und Studenten zu suspendieren, sollten sie ein Protestcamp auf dem Universitätsgelände nicht bis zum Nachmittag verlassen. Doch das Gegenteil geschah: Auf Videos vom Campus war zu sehen, wie Vermummte mit schwarz-weißen Palästinensertüchern Fenster einschlagen und den Eingang der Hamilton Hall mit Stühlen und Tischen verbarrikadieren. Nach Angaben der Studierendenzeitung «Columbia Spectator» drangen mehrere Dutzend Protestierende in das Gebäude ein, während Hunderte weitere davor demonstrierten.
Die Studierendengruppen «Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine» und «Columbia University Apartheid Divest» kündigten an, die Hamilton Hall nicht zu verlassen, bis ihre Forderungen erfüllt würden. «Ein Gebäude zu besetzen, ist ein geringes Risiko im Vergleich zum täglichen Widerstand der Palästinenser im Gazastreifen», hieß es in einer auf der Plattform X, früher Twitter, verbreiteten Stellungnahme. Die Demonstrierenden kritisieren das Vorgehen Israels im Gaza-Krieg und fordern Solidarität mit den Palästinensern. Außerdem verlangen sie von der Hochschule, finanzielle Beziehungen mit Israel zu kappen. Die Universität lehnte das bisher ab.
UN-Generalsekretär: Freie Meinungsäußerung muss möglich sein
Auch die US-Regierung reagierte auf die Besetzung während der Nacht: «Die gewaltsame Übernahme eines Gebäudes auf dem Campus ist der absolut falsche Weg. Das ist kein Beispiel für friedlichen Protest», sagte der Kommunikationsdirektor des Nationalen Sicherheitsrats, John Kirby. Ein kleiner Prozentsatz von Studierenden sollte nicht in der Lage sein, die akademische Ausbildung aller zu stören. «Studenten, die für ihren Universitätsbesuch bezahlen und eine Ausbildung anstreben, sollten dieser ungestört folgen können, und sie sollten sich dabei sicher fühlen können», sagte Kirby. Hassrede und Symbole des Hasses hätten in den USA keinen Platz.
UN-Generalsekretär António Guterres wandte sich ebenfalls gegen Hassrede, betonte aber auch, dass freie Meinungsäußerung möglich sein müsse. Die Universitäten sollten ihre Weisheit nutzen, um angemessen mit der Situation umzugehen.
Kritik an New Yorker Polizei
Vor knapp zwei Wochen hatte ein Einsatz der New Yorker Polizei an der Columbia-Universität für Aufsehen und Kritik gesorgt, in der Folge kam es an Dutzenden Universitäten in den USA zu Protesten und der Errichtung von Zeltlagern. Einigen Demonstrierenden wird Antisemitismus und die Verharmlosung der islamistischen Hamas vorgeworfen, deren Ziel die Vernichtung des Staates Israel ist.
Israels Präsident Izchak Herzog nannte die «entsetzlichen antisemitischen Aktionen» an der Universität Columbia zutiefst beunruhigend. «Die amerikanische Wissenschaft muss sich der Bedrohung bewusst werden», schrieb Herzog auf der Plattform X. Er sprach von «einer klaren und gegenwärtigen Gefahr für die akademische Freiheit und für das Leben der Juden auf dem Campus». Herzog forderte, antisemitische Aktionen auf dem Campus zu unterbinden.
Die Hamas und andere islamistische Gruppen hatten bei ihrem Überfall auf Israel am 7. Oktober vergangenen Jahres etwa 1200 Menschen getötet und mehr als 250 als Geiseln in den Gazastreifen verschleppt. Israel reagierte darauf mit einer Bodenoffensive und Luftangriffen auf das Küstengebiet. In der Folge wurden nach – unabhängig kaum zu verifizierenden – Angaben der von der Hamas kontrollierten Gesundheitsbehörde seit Kriegsbeginn etwa 34 500 Menschen getötet.

Article: Wolfsburg/Langenfeld (dpa/tmn) – Haben Sie ein Profil bei Xing, LinkedIn oder ähnlichen Jobnetzwerken? Für Recruiterinnen und Recruiter sind sie mittlerweile enorm wichtig, wenn es um die Besetzung von Stellen geht. Dabei kommt es aber auch darauf an, wie Jobsuchende die Portale nutzen. Diese Tipps sollten sie befolgen:
1. Profil mit beruflichen Details füttern
Peter Nollido, Senior Recruiter bei Volkswagen, sucht regelmäßig auch in Jobnetzwerken nach potenziellen neuen Mitarbeitern. Dabei achte er auf ein vollständiges Profil, in dem neben bisherigen Berufsstationen vor allem Kenntnisse, Fähigkeiten oder Weiterbildungen angegeben sein sollten.
«Oft fehlen uns als Personaler genauere Details, womit die Kandidaten in ihrem beruflichen Alltag zu tun haben», sagt Nollido. Je mehr Kenntnisse jemand angibt, desto sichtbarer werde er im Netzwerk. Dabei sollten vor allem auch fachliche Spezialisierungen Erwähnung finden, sofern sie für die Jobsuche relevant sein könnten.
2. Auf richtige Einstellungen achten
Jobsuchende sollten darauf achten, das eigene Profil offen zu schalten. Nur so können Personalerinnen und Personaler die Profilinformationen einsehen. «Berufsbezogene Daten fallen nicht unter den Datenschutz. Am Ende sehen wir auch nur den Namen der Person. Da rate ich zu etwas mehr Mut», so Nollido.
Auch ein aktuelles Foto hält der Recruiter für sinnvoll. «Hier hat man, beispielsweise bei LinkedIn, die Möglichkeit, einen Rahmen um das Bild legen zu lassen, in dem #OpenToWork steht. Als Personaler werden wir direkt informiert, wenn ein Kandidat aus unserem Netzwerk diese Frame-Einstellung gemacht hat.»
Gehaltsvorstellungen dagegen haben nichts auf dem Profil verloren, findet der Experte. «Das kann dazu führen, schon vorzeitig aussortiert zu werden.» Das Gehalt sei ein wichtiges und sensibles Thema, das erst im direkten Gespräch aufkommen sollte.
3. Mut bei Kontaktanfragen
VW-Recruiter Nollido empfiehlt, sich bei Interesse an einem konkreten Unternehmen mit dem Personaler oder dem einstellenden Fachbereich zu verbinden. «Durch diesen Kontakt erhält man regelmäßig alle wichtigen Informationen über den Fachbereich, Aktivitäten des Unternehmens oder offene Stellen.»
Und auch über ganz direkte Nachfragen freut sich Peter Nollido. «Selbst wenn heute keine vakante Stelle vorhanden ist, weiß ich so trotzdem, dass der Kandidat Interesse hat. Ich habe dann die Möglichkeit, diesen Kandidaten zu speichern.» Daraus ergebe sich oft die Möglichkeit zu einem weiteren Austausch.
4. Den gegenseitigen Austausch suchen
«Karrierenetzwerke sind nicht nur dafür da, um auf der Karriereleiter den nächsten Schritt zu machen», sagt Beraterin Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig. Sie dienen der Coachin zufolge auch dazu, sich über verschiedene Themen zu informieren und auszutauschen.
Wer sich etwa zu einer bestimmten Branche oder einem Fachthema informieren möchte, könne sich mit entsprechenden Spezialisten vernetzen. «Ich kann auch schauen, ob ich im Netzwerk jemanden finde, der genau den Job hat, der mich interessiert, und um einen Austausch bitten. Die meisten Menschen sind positiv gestimmt und beantworten gerne Fragen.»
5. Langfristig denken
Wer von einem Karrierenetzwerk profitieren will, sollte frühzeitig damit anfangen, es zu pflegen. «Es ist ganz wichtig, das Netzwerk langfristig aufzubauen. Das unterschätzen viele. Ein Netzwerk muss bereits da sein, wenn ich es brauche», sagt Herrmann-Hurtzig.
Das funktioniere aber nur, wenn das Netzwerk als Ort des Nehmens und Geben verstanden würde. «Viele Leute denken, sie könnten nichts geben, aber das stimmt oft nicht. Unabhängig vom Lebensalter kann jeder etwas geben, hat jeder Qualifikationen oder Kompetenzen, die das Netzwerk bereichern.»
6. Lesen, speichern, teilen: Auf Netzwerken aktiv bleiben
Der Schlüssel für ein intaktes Netzwerk liegt dabei auch in der eigenen Aktivität. Wer nie Beiträge anschaut, speichert, kommentiert oder teilt, wird nicht wahrgenommen. «Dann geht das System davon aus, dass kein Interesse an einem Jobwechsel besteht und man rutscht in der Suche ganz weit nach unten», sagt Peter Nollido.
Zu Beginn kann es hilfreich sein, sich andere Profile aus ähnlichen Branchen oder Interessengebieten anzuschauen. «Dann vernetze ich mich mit allen Kontakten, die ich in meiner eigenen Branche brauche. Da sollte man keine Scheu haben», rät Nollido.
7. Anfragen richtig beurteilen
Vorsicht ist geboten, wenn Anfragen kommen, hinter denen keine offizielle Firma steckt. «Manche Unternehmen sammeln nur Daten und geben diese dann weiter. Da würde ich prüfen, ob es die Firma überhaupt gibt, ob sie eine Webseite hat und so weiter», sagt Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig.
Ein weiteres Indiz für einen Betrug sind generisch formulierte Nachrichten, die sich nicht auf das eigene Profil beziehen, sagt Peter Nollido.
Ein bisschen Geduld braucht es manchmal, wenn Headhunter eingeschaltet wurden. In diesem Fall ist es nicht unüblich, dass zunächst keine Informationen über die vakante Stelle oder die suchende Firma geteilt werden dürfen. Spätestens im zweiten Kontakt aber sollte die Anfrage deutlich konkreter werden, sagt Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig.

Article: Köln (dpa/tmn) – Die Spargel-Saison ist in vollem Gange. Wer den Geschmack besonders intensiv auskosten möchte, serviert grünen Spargel mit handgemachtem grünem Spargelpesto. Als Nudelsalat macht das Gericht eine hervorragende Figur zum Grillen oder auf dem Buffet.
Der Spargel wird in diesem Rezept in hauchdünne Streifen geschnitten und nur kurz blanchiert. Das sieht nicht nur hübsch aus, sondern sorgt auch dafür, dass sich der Spargel gut mit den Linguine vermengen lässt. Gleichzeitig bildet er aber mit seinem knackigen Biss auch einen schönen Kontrapunkt zu den weichen Nudeln.
Sein besonders Aroma erhält der Nudelsalat zum einen durch das frische Dressing aus Weißweinessig, Olivenöl und Zitrone und zum anderen durch das cremige Pesto aus grünem Spargel, gerösteten Pinienkernen, Parmesan, Knoblauch und Petersilie.
Zutaten für 4 Portionen:
750 g grüner Spargel
1 TL Zucker
1 TL Salz
1 TL Butter
300 g Linguine
30 g Pinienkerne
20 g Parmesan (am Stück)
15 g Petersilie
1 Bio-Zitrone
1 Zehe Knoblauch
2 EL Weißweinessig
3 EL Olivenöl
Pfeffer
Zubereitung:
1. Spargel gründlich waschen und das untere Drittel schälen. Spargelköpfe und das untere Drittel abschneiden. Die Spargelstangen dann mit einem Sparschäler oder einem scharfen Messer längs in hauchdünne Streifen schneiden.
2. Einen Topf mit ca. 700 ml Wasser mit 1 TL Salz, 1 TL Zucker und 1 TL Butter zum Kochen bringen. Spargel-Enden ins Wasser geben. Ca. 2 Minuten bei mittlerer Temperatur köcheln lassen. Die Spargelköpfe dazugeben noch mal ca. 2 Minuten köcheln lassen. Alles mit einer Schaumkelle aus dem Wasser heben und beiseitestellen. Dann den in Streifen geschnittenen Spargel in das Wasser geben und ca. 1 Minute köcheln lassen. Über einem Sieb abgießen.
3. Linguine laut Packungsanleitung al dente kochen und mit kaltem Wasser abspülen.
4. Pinienkerne in einer Pfanne ohne Öl bei mittlerer Hitze goldbraun rösten. Parmesan fein reiben. Petersilie waschen und trocken schütteln. Zitrone waschen und abtrocknen. Ca. 1 TL von der Schale abreiben, den Saft auspressen. Knoblauch schälen.
5. Die Spargel-Enden, Pinienkerne, Parmesan, Petersilie (samt Stielen), Knoblauch und etwas Wasser mit einem Mixer oder Pürierstab zu einer feinen Creme verarbeiten.
6. In einer großen Schüssel Weißweinessig, Zitronensaft, Zitronenabrieb und Olivenöl vermengen. Spargelpesto unterrühren. Mit Salz und Pfeffer abschmecken.
7. Spargelköpfe längs halbieren und zusammen mit den Spargelstreifen dazugeben. Nudeln unterheben und alles gut vermengen.

Article: Berlin (dpa/tmn). Welche Ketten kommen mit in den Urlaub? Am liebsten alle. Das Problem: Lose im Kosmetiktäschchen oder Kulturbeutel verstaut, können sie sich verknoten oder ineinander verheddern. Das Entwirren kann eine Weile dauern. Also besser vorbeugen – doch was hilft gegen das Ketten-Wirrwarr?
TikTok, Instagram und Co. sind voll von Lifehacks, für fast jedes Problem gibt es eine simple Lösung, die nur wenige Handgriffe erfordert und nicht teuer sein soll. Für das Kettenchaos sollen Strohhalme die rettende Lösung sein.
Doch wir wissen, dass das Internet nicht immer die Wahrheit sagt. Deshalb haben wir den Tipp für knotenfreie Ketten in unserem Hack-Check getestet. Hält der Lifehack was er verspricht – oder ist er ein Flop?
Und so geht's: Für jede Kette braucht man einen Strohhalm – am besten aus Papier, das ist nachhaltiger. Die Kette wird durch den Strohhalm gefädelt und verschlossen – fertig. Bei kürzeren Ketten kann man den Strohhalm einfach abschneiden.
Fazit: Der Hack funktioniert ausgezeichnet. Auch wenn man viele Ketten auf einmal in eine Tasche packt, lassen sie sich dank der Strohhalme wieder leicht voneinander trennen.

Article: Trier (ots).
Am Dienstagabend, 30.04., kam es gegen 23:30 Uhr zu einem Verkehrsunfall am Trierer Pacelliufer, bei dem zwei Pkw miteinander kollidierten. Der 22-Jährige Unfallverursacher, welcher offensichtlich unter Alkoholeinfluss stand, fuhr mit einem Dacia Logan zuvor mit überhöhter Geschwindigkeit auf der B51 in Richtung Trier. Als er eine rote Ampel im Kreuzungsbereich zur Pellinger Straße ignorierte und diese überfuhr, kam es zum Zusammenstoß mit einem einbiegenden Audi.
Der Dacia wurde durch den Zusammenprall in Richtung des Moselradwegs geschleudert und überschlug sich hierbei auch, ehe er auf dem Dach landete.
Glücklicherweise wurden die Insassen durch den Aufprall nicht schwerer verletzt, an beiden Fahrzeugen entstand jedoch ein Totalschaden.
Dem Dacia-Fahrer wurde im Anschluss eine Blutprobe entnommen. Zudem konnte er keine gültige Fahrerlaubnis vorweisen.
Zeugen, welche den Verkehrsunfall beobachtet haben oder Angaben zur Fahrweise des Dacia machen können, werden gebeten sich mit der Polizeiinspektion Trier unter der 0651-9779-5210 in Verbindung zu setzen.

Article: München (dpa) – Bayern-Trainer Thomas Tuchel richtete den Blick nach dem am Ende ärgerlichen 2:2 in der ersten Halbfinal-Begegnung gegen Real Madrid ganz schnell auf das entscheidende Champions-League-Rückspiel in Spanien.
«Es lohnt sich nicht, lange mit dem Ergebnis zu hadern. Die Ausgangslage ist ganz klar. Wir fahren nach Madrid – and the winner takes it all», sagte Tuchel in der Allianz Arena. Der Sieger am Mittwoch kommender Woche wird dann ins Endspiel am 1. Juni im Londoner Wembleystadion einziehen.
Die Bayern hatten die Partie in der Allianz Arena nach dem 0:1-Pausenstand durch Tore von Leroy Sané und Harry Kane gedreht. Aber in der Schlussphase schlug Real durch einen Elfmeter des zweifachen Torschützen Vinicius Junior zurück. «Real hat das schon mit anderen Teams gemacht», bemerkte Tuchel zu Reals Effektivität. «Wir haben die erste Hälfte verloren und die zweite gewonnen», sagte Tuchel: «Es ist immer noch ein Fifty-fifty-Spiel.»
Ähnlich äußerte sich Real-Coach Carlo Ancelotti: «Es ist noch nichts entschieden.» Angesichts des Heimvorteils im Halbfinal-Rückspiel wertete der ehemalige Bayern-Coach das Ergebnis allerdings als «gut fürs Rückspiel».
«Das Bernabeu ist einer der schwersten Orte»
Tuchel weiß, dass es eine große Leistung seiner Bayern braucht, um mit dem Finaleinzug in der Königsklasse die letzte Titelchance der Saison zu erhalten. «Das Bernabeu-Stadion ist einer der schwersten Orte, zu gewinnen», sagte der 50-Jährige. «Wir haben 90 Minuten, 120 Minuten, vielleicht ein Elfmeterschießen. Das Ziel ist klar, wir müssen gewinnen.»

Article: Berlin (dpa/tmn). Der Motor geht aus, im Cockpit leuchten sämtliche Warnlampen, alle Startversuche schlagen fehl. Der Wagen streikt. Wer dann nicht auf die Hilfe eines professionellen Abschleppunternehmens setzen will, muss sich abschleppen lassen. Dabei müssen aber einige Dinge beachtet werden.
Ist das Abschleppen immer erlaubt?
Nein. Laut geltender Gesetzgebung muss ein gerechtfertigter Notstand vorliegen, bevor ein Fahrzeug an den Haken genommen werden darf, erklärt Matthias Strixner von Tüv Süd: «Ein leerer Tank etwa ist kein Grund zum Abschleppen.» Dann müsste man sich via Reservetank selbst behelfen oder einen Pannendienst zur Hilfe holen.
Auch eine leere Batterie oder der Ausfall der Elektrik berechtigten nicht zum Abschleppen, denn beide Fahrzeuge müssten mit aktivierten Warnblinkern unterwegs sein.
Kann der Wagen nicht vor Ort repariert werden, muss der Havarist auf dem kürzesten Weg in die nächste Werkstatt geschleppt werden.
Abschleppen: Warnweste an und Abschleppöse suchen
Führt kein Weg am Abschleppen vorbei, braucht es einige Vorsichtsmaßnahmen. «Im ersten Schritt sollte eine Warnweste angezogen und die Gefahrenstelle abgesichert werden», sagt Jeannine Ulm vom Auto Club Europa (ACE). Dann müssen die Fahrzeuge präpariert werden. Neuere Fahrzeuge verfügen über Abschleppösen, die zunächst eingeschraubt werden müssen. Meist befindet sich das entsprechende Gewinde im Bereich der Stoßstange hinter einer Plastikkappe, die zuvor entfernt werden muss.
Was gilt beim Abschleppen auf der Autobahn?
Wer auf der Autobahn liegenbleibt, für den gelten besondere Regeln. Der ADAC weist darauf hin, dass dort nur abgeschleppt werden darf, wenn die Panne auch dort passiert. Dann gelte es, die Autobahn mit dem havarierten Fahrzeug auf dem kürzesten Weg zu verlassen. Als Transferweg zwischen Pannenort und Werkstatt darf die Autobahn nicht genutzt werden.
Mit welchem Auto sollte abgeschleppt werden?
Hier sind die Kräfteverhältnisse wichtig: «Das Zugfahrzeug muss ordnungsgemäß angemeldet sein und sollte schwerer und größer sein als das abzuschleppende Fahrzeug», rät Philipp Mathey von Automobil-Club Verkehr (ACV). Wichtig: Auf die maximal erlaubte Zugkraft des Abschleppseils bzw. der Abschleppstange achten.
Abschleppstange oder Abschleppseil?
Beide Varianten haben Vor- und Nachteile. «Am besten geeignet sind Nylonseile. Sie dehnen sich und fangen so ruckartige Bewegungen auf», sagt Matthias Strixner. In jedem Fall aber müssten beide Varianten ausreichend dimensioniert sein und der lichte Abstand zwischen beiden Fahrzeugen darf nicht mehr als fünf Meter betragen.
Zudem müssen Seil oder Stange in der Mitte für andere Verkehrsteilnehmer ausreichend sichtbar und kenntlich gemacht werden, zum Beispiel durch einen roten Lappen oder ein Fähnchen. Abschleppstangen sind Strixner zufolge am sichersten, aber auch sperrig und im Vergleich zu Seilen teurer. Dafür sorgt die Stange immer für den richtigen Abstand. Wird mit einem Seil abgeschleppt, muss dieses immer unter Spannung gehalten werden.
Beim Abschleppen: Zündung ein und langsam fahren
Seil oder Stange sollten nie diagonal zum Einsatz kommen, da der Pannenwagen ansonsten in den Gegenverkehr oder auf den Gehweg gezogen werden könnte, warnt Strixner. Wichtig zudem: Das Lenkradschloss darf nicht plötzlich einrasten können. Es muss also muss je nach Ausführung die Fahrposition des Zündschlosses aktiviert sein.
Ansonsten gelte es, mit sehr gemäßigtem Tempo und besonders hoher Aufmerksamkeit unterwegs zu sein. «Es gibt keine Höchstgeschwindigkeit beim Abschleppen. Aber es empfiehlt sich, maximal 50 km/h zu fahren, weil bei ausgeschaltetem Motor des Pannenautos auch Bremsverstärker und Servolenkung nicht aktiviert sind», sagt Philipp Mathey vom ACV. Sonst reicht die Bremskraft eventuell nicht aus und man fährt schlimmstenfalls auf das abschleppende Fahrzeug auf.
Wichtig: Kommunizieren
Bevor sich ein Abschleppgespann in Bewegung setzt, sollten sich die Beteiligten absprechen, wie sie sich während der Fahrt verständigen. Ideal ist hierfür die Freisprecheinrichtung des Mobiltelefons. Da beide Fahrzeuge mit Warnblinkern unterwegs sind, muss das Blinken zudem via Handzeichen aus dem Fenster erfolgen. «Das ist insbesondere beim Rechtsabbiegen anspruchsvoll. Hier kann man aus dem linken Fenster heraus über das Autodach nach rechts zeigen», rät Mathey.
Vorsicht bei Abschleppen von Automatik und Allrad
Fahrzeuge mit Schaltgetriebe können problemlos im Leerlauf abgeschleppt werden, bei einem Automatikgetriebe jedoch gibt es mitunter Einschränkungen. Hier muss die Schaltstufe N gewählt werden. «Viele Automatikgetriebe aber sind empfindlich und können nur für einige Kilometer gefahrlos abgeschleppt werden», sagt ACV-Experte Mathey.
Der Grund sei die starke Wärmeentwicklung beim Abschleppen, die Schäden verursachen könne. Bei vielen modernen Automatikmodellen jedoch lasse sich die Verbindung zwischen Antriebsachse und Getriebe entriegeln. Auch für Allradfahrzeuge kann es Einschränkungen geben. Daher empfiehlt sich vor dem Abschleppen immer ein Blick in die Betriebsanleitung.
Sonderfall E-Auto
E-Autos sollten besser gar nicht abgeschleppt werden. «Die Räder drehen die Elektromotoren mit, wodurch die Motoren Strom erzeugen. Das Auto aber ist nicht betriebsbereit, dadurch kann die Leistungselektronik oder die Batterie beschädigt werden», warnt Jeannine Ulm. Gleiches gelte auch für Hybridfahrzeuge. Wer mit einem Stromer oder Hybridfahrzeug liegenbleibt, sollte den Wagen daher von einem Abschleppunternehmen Huckepack in die Werkstatt bringen lassen.
Abschleppen ist auch ohne Führerschein möglich
Wird ein Auto abgeschleppt, darf der Pannenwagen auch von einer Person ohne gültige Fahrerlaubnis gesteuert werden. «Es empfiehlt sich aber, einen erfahrenen und geeigneten Fahrer ans Lenkrad des defekten Autos zu setzen, da der Abstand zwischen dem ziehenden Fahrzeug und dem Pannenwagen sehr kurz ist und dadurch die Reaktionszeiten sehr gering sind», rät Matthias Strixner. Krafträder dürfen übrigens gar nicht abgeschleppt werden.
Wer zahlt bei Schäden?
Kommt es beim privaten Abschleppen zu einem Unfall, ist laut ACE zunächst einmal jedes Fahrzeug für sich zu betrachten. «Nach der aktuellen Rechtsprechung wird das abgeschleppte Fahrzeug nicht zum Anhänger», so Jeannine Ulm. Wenn daher keinem der Fahrzeugführer:innen ein Vorwurf gemacht werden könne, würden beide in gleichem Umfang haften und somit auch ihre jeweiligen Versicherungen.

Article: Düsseldorf (dpa/tmn) – Die Aussicht auf einen Klinikaufenthalt, die ist wohl für niemanden so richtig schön. Nicht nur, weil sich vorab Ängste melden, ob der Eingriff wie geplant verläuft, ob man die Narkose gut verträgt, wie schnell man wortwörtlich wieder auf die Beine kommt. Die Gedanken kreisen vielleicht auch um Fragen wie: Habe ich an alles gedacht, muss ich noch etwas klären? Hier bekommen Sie einen Überblick:
Was muss ich vorab erledigen?
Der Termin für die Krankenhausbehandlung steht, vielleicht hat man Ihnen schon eine Prognose gegeben, wie viele Nächte Sie dort bleiben müssen. Diese Information sollten Sie weitergeben an alle, die mit Ihrer Abwesenheit planen müssen. Zum Beispiel an den Arbeitgeber, wie Verena Querling, Referentin Pflegerecht bei der Verbraucherzentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen, sagt.
Was sonst noch erledigt werden muss? «Das hängt natürlich von der jeweiligen Lebenssituation ab», sagt Querling. Vielleicht braucht es jemanden, der die Gemüsebeete im Garten in dieser Zeit gießt, die Katze versorgt, den Briefkasten leert, die Tochter zum Turnunterricht fährt. «Am besten spannt man frühzeitig ein Netz, das dann aushelfen kann.»
Und wer springt ein, wenn man zum Beispiel den Partner oder die Mutter pflegt, das aber wegen des Krankenhausaufenthalts für eine Weile nicht kann? Dann kann die Verhinderungspflege eine Option ein. Das bedeutet: Die Pflegeversicherung trägt für Pflegebedürftige der Grade 2 bis 5 die nachgewiesenen Kosten einer Ersatzpflege. Diese Ersatzpflege kann durch einen ambulanten Pflegedienst, durch Einzelpflegekräfte, ehrenamtlich Pflegende, aber auch durch nahe Angehörige erfolgen, heißt es vom Bundesgesundheitsministerium.
Was braucht das Krankenhaus alles von mir?
Ohne Versichertenkarte und Personalausweis geht bei der Anmeldung nichts. Um im Krankenhaus aufgenommen zu werden, muss zudem eine Einweisung vorliegen («Verordnung von Krankenhausbehandlung»), die von Haus- oder Facharzt ausgestellt wird. Wer privat krankenversichert ist, sollte die Kostenzusage der Krankenkasse parat haben.
Sofern man eine Patientenverfügung oder eine Vorsorgevollmacht hat, ist es sinnvoll, auch diese mitzunehmen, rät Verena Querling. Und natürlich sollte man dafür sorgen, dass das Krankenhaus möglichst gut über den eigenen Gesundheitszustand und Besonderheiten Bescheid weiß. Vor einem geplanten Eingriff wird das im Vorgespräch abgefragt.
«Von einem Herzschrittmacher oder einer Prothese müssen die Ärzte natürlich wissen. Und auch, welche Medikamente man einnimmt», sagt Querling. Allergiker bringen ihren Allergie-Pass mit, wer Blutverdünner einnimmt, sollte seinen Marcumar-Pass einstecken. Die meisten Krankenhäuser geben auf ihrer Webseite auch eine Checkliste, welche Dokumente genau benötigt werden.
Wichtig ist zudem, dem Krankenhaus die Kontaktdaten der Hausarztpraxis zu geben, damit Kommunikation und Austausch von Befunden reibungslos klappen können.
Was kommt ansonsten in die Tasche?
Wenn Sie vor dem Kleiderschrank stehen und überlegen, was in die Kliniktasche wandern soll, sollten Sie diesem Grundsatz folgen: «Worin man sich wohlfühlt und was bequem ist, Kleidungsstücke, in denen man auch den Gang im Krankenhaus runterlaufen würde», sagt Verena Querling. Gerade bei frischen OP-Narben sind eher weit geschnittene Kleidungsstücke sinnvoll, da drückt nichts.
Hilfsmittel wie Hörgerät oder Brillen müssen natürlich auch mit. Hier gilt besondere Vorsicht, damit sie nicht verloren gehen, wenn man sie vor dem Eingriff ablegt. «Manchmal werden die einfach in Taschentücher gewickelt und sind dann auf einmal weg», sagt Querling. Besser: sicher in Dose oder Etui verstauen und vorab klären, wie sie wieder den Weg zu einem finden.
Und natürlich sollte man auch Dinge einpacken, die der Langeweile im Krankenhaus etwas entgegensetzen, «ob es das Sudoku-Heft, ein Headset zum Musikhören oder ein schönes Buch ist», sagt Querling.
Wer Serien streamen will, sollte sich vorab über die WLAN-Situation im Krankenhaus informieren. Einer Auswertung von Verivox aus dem Mai 2023 zufolge bieten 70 Prozent der größten Kliniken und Krankenhäuser in Deutschland kostenloses WLAN auf den Patientenzimmern an. Wer doch für die Internetnutzung zahlen muss, kann sich auf Kosten von etwa drei bis fünf Euro pro Tag einstellen.
Und was bleibt besser zu Hause? Wertsachen, insbesondere Schmuck. «Man muss Ringe und Co. ja ohnehin ausziehen, wenn es in den OP geht», sagt Querling.
Was kostet mich der Krankenhausaufenthalt?
Die Zuzahlung liegt für gesetzlich Krankenversicherte ab 18 Jahren bei 10 Euro pro Tag. Wer länger als 28 Tage im Kalenderjahr stationär im Krankenhaus behandelt wird, muss ab dem 29. Tag nichts mehr zuzahlen.
Die Krankenhäuser rechnen dabei direkt mit den Patientinnen und Patienten ab, nach der Entlassung landet also eine Rechnung im Briefkasten.
Apropos Entlassung: Was muss ich dafür alles regeln?
Spätestens, wenn sich das Ende des Klinikaufenthalts abzeichnet, kommt das sogenannte Entlassmanagement des Krankenhauses ins Spiel, das meist beim sozialen Dienst liegt. Dessen Ziel ist es, den Übergang zwischen Krankenhausaufenthalt und der Zeit danach möglichst reibungslos zu gestalten.
Je frühzeitiger man Kontakt zum Entlassmanagement aufnimmt, desto besser – gerade dann, wenn man auch über die Klinikzeit hinaus Unterstützung benötigt, rät Verena Querling. Das Entlassmanagement unterstützt bei Anträgen, zum Beispiel auf einen Pflegegrad. Auch Leistungen wie häusliche Krankenpflege, eine Haushaltshilfe oder Pflegehilfsmittel wie Rollstuhl, Pflegebett oder Toilettenstuhl können aus dem Krankenhaus beantragt und organisiert werden. Und wenn man nach dem Krankenhausaufenthalt noch nicht fit genug für zu Hause ist, kann eine Kurzzeitpflege gesucht werden.
Was muss ich wissen, wenn ich mich selbst entlassen möchte?
«Dann gibt es ein Formular, auf dem man noch einmal darauf hingewiesen wird, dass die Entlassung gegen ärztlichen Rat ist», sagt Verena Querling. Das muss man unterschreiben, wenn man sich selbst entlassen möchte. Dabei geht es um Haftungsfragen. Bleiben durch das vorzeitige Verlassen des Krankenhauses langfristige Schäden zurück, wird es schwierig, diese vor Gericht als ärztlichen Behandlungsfehler anerkennen zu lassen.
Das heißt aber nicht, dass man abgewiesen wird, wenn man doch wieder ärztliche Behandlung benötigt. «Sollte zum Beispiel eine OP-Wunde doch wieder aufgehen, wird man natürlich wieder behandelt», sagt Verena Querling.
Kann das Krankenhaus mich krankschreiben?
Ja, das ist möglich, für bis zu sieben Tage. «Das verschafft einem ein bisschen Luft, sodass man nicht sofort zum Hausarzt muss, wenn man aus dem Krankenhaus kommt», sagt Verena Querling.
Gut möglich, dass man sich aber doch zeitnah auf den Weg zur Arztpraxis machen muss, nämlich dann, wenn man Medikamente benötigt. Denn Krankenhäuser dürfen sie nur begrenzt mitgeben bzw. verordnen.
Wird man vor oder an einem Wochenende oder Feiertag entlassen, darf das Krankenhaus nur so viele Medikamente mitgeben, wie es zur Überbrückung dieser Tage braucht. Die Klinik kann Medikamente aber auch verordnen, sodass man sie nach der Entlassung selbst in der Apotheke abholen kann. Möglich ist dabei allerdings höchstens die kleinste Packungsgröße.

Article: Berlin (dpa/tmn). Wer seine mindestens zehn Jahre alte, zu eigenen Wohnzwecken genutzte Immobilie einer energetischen Sanierung unterzieht, kann dabei steuerlich profitieren. Die Kosten des ausführenden Fachunternehmens sind zu 20 Prozent absetzbar – bis zu einer Höchstgrenze von 40.000 Euro und verteilt über einen Zeitraum von drei Jahren. Wichtige Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass Steuerzahlerinnen und Steuerzahler parallel keine anderen Fördermittel der KfW oder des Bundesamts für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle (BAFA) in Anspruch nehmen. Und, dass sie den Aufwand nicht in Raten bezahlen. Sonst ist der Bonus unter Umständen verspielt.
Genau das ist Steuerzahlern bereits passiert. Auf ein entsprechendes Urteil des Finanzgerichts München (Az.: 8 K 1534/23) verweist der Bund der Steuerzahler. In dem konkreten Fall hatte ein Paar in seinem Einfamilienhaus eine neue Heizungsanlage einbauen lassen. Preis: rund 8120 Euro. Im Jahr der Fertigstellung bezahlte das Paar aber zunächst nur 2000 Euro, der restliche Betrag sollte in Raten abgestottert werden. Das zuständige Finanzamt versagte dem Paar den Steuerabzug daraufhin. Zurecht, wie das Gericht später feststellte.
Aufwand und Zahlung müssen in einem Jahr zusammenfallen
«Ausgaben werden im Steuerrecht in der Regel nur in dem Jahr berücksichtigt, in dem sie anfallen», sagt Daniela Karbe-Geßler vom Bund der Steuerzahler. Zum vollständigen Abschluss einer energetischen Maßnahme zählt aber eben nicht nur die Fertigstellung durch die Handwerker. Auch die vollständige Bezahlung der Arbeiten ist dafür notwendige Bedingung.
Wird die Maßnahme im Jahr der Installation nicht vollständig bezahlt, fallen Aufwand und Zahlung nicht zusammen, wodurch die Kosten grundsätzlich nicht absetzbar sind – weder in Teilen noch zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt.
«Deshalb ist es nach aktueller Rechtsprechung wichtig, den Rechnungsbetrag im Jahr der Fertigstellung der Maßnahme komplett und nicht in Raten zu zahlen», so Karbe-Geßler. Denn selbst wenn alle anderen Voraussetzungen vorbildlich erfüllt sind, also etwa die erforderlichen Bescheinigungen über die Maßnahme vorliegen und die Steuererklärung korrekt ausgefüllt wurde, kann es am Ende genau an der Zahlungsmethode scheitern.

Article: Frankfurt/Main/Düsseldorf (dpa/tmn) – Klar ist: Eine Zweitmeinung kommt nur dann in Betracht, wenn keine Zeitnot besteht. Darauf weist Professor Thomas Meinertz vom Wissenschaftlichen Beirat der Deutschen Herzstiftung hin. Bei einem Herzinfarkt etwa ist schnelles Handeln gefragt.
Aber vor allem das Wie mancher Behandlung kann durchaus abgewogen werden. Ist ein chirurgischer Eingriff nötig, ist eine OP per Herzkatheter möglich oder reichen vielleicht sogar Medikamente – unterschiedliche Ärzte können das jeweils anders beurteilen.
Besonderes Verfahren für bestimmte OPs
Für bestimmte Operationen gibt es ein spezielles Zweitmeinungsverfahren. Beim Herzen ist das etwa das Einsetzen eines Schrittmachers oder eine Verödung am Herzen. In so einem Fall müssen behandelnder Arzt oder Ärztin sogar mindestens zehn Tage vor der Operation darauf hinweisen, dass eine Beratung bei einem entsprechend qualifizierten Arzt möglich ist. Das erklärt die Verbraucherzentrale NRW auf ihrer Webseite.
Diese Beratung kann man dann annehmen oder nicht. Die entsprechenden Zweitexperten müssen besonders qualifiziert und unabhängig sein und brauchen eine Genehmigung der Kassenärztlichen Vereinigung. Eine Auflistung findet sich auf der Website des ärztlichen Bereitschaftsdienstes.
Selbstständig um Zweitmeinung kümmern
Aber auch bei anderen geplanten Herz-OPs kann eine Zweitmeinung sinnvoll sein, sagt Professor Meinertz. Etwa bei einem Herzklappenersatz oder einer Bypass-Operation. Jeder Patient und jede Patientin hat das Recht, sich diese einzuholen. Aber wo? Sich selbst im Internet umzusehen, hält der Herzexperte wegen zu positiver Selbstdarstellungen für problematisch. Besser erkundige man sich der entsprechenden Krankenkasse oder Ärztekammer.
Auch der behandelnde Arzt oder die Ärztin kann jemanden empfehlen. Denn im Idealfall ist er offen für eine weitere Einschätzung. Ein No-Go sei allerdings, sagt Meinertz, dass einfach ein befreundeter Kollege angerufen werde, der voreingenommen nur die Erstmeinung bestätigen solle. Vielmehr sollte der nach einer zweiten Meinung Gefragte nicht von vornherein auf eine bestimmte Methode festgelegt sein.
Was Patienten und Patientinnen jedoch vermeiden sollten: Noch eine Dritt- oder gar Viertmeinung einzuholen. Das verunsichert laut dem Herzspezialisten am Ende nur.

Article: Konflikt
New York (dpa) - Propalästinensischen Demonstrierenden droht nach der Besetzung eines Gebäudes der New Yorker Elite-Universität Columbia der Rausschmiss. Man habe sehr deutlich gemacht, «dass die Arbeit der Universität nicht endlos durch Demonstranten gestört werden kann, die gegen die Regeln verstoßen. Wenn dies weiterhin geschieht, wird dies klare Konsequenzen nach sich ziehen», hieß es in einer Stellungnahme der Hochschule.
Den Dutzenden Studierenden, die die Hamilton Hall besetzt hielten, drohe der Ausschluss. Auch das Weiße Haus übte deutliche Kritik am Vorgehen der Demonstrantinnen und Demonstranten, die gegen Israels Vorgehen im Gaza-Krieg und die Unterstützung des jüdischen Staates durch die US-Regierung protestieren.
Die seit knapp zwei Wochen andauernden Proteste an der Universität in der liberalen Ostküstenmetropole New York waren eskaliert. Demonstrierende drangen in die Hamilton Hall auf dem Campus im Norden Manhattans ein, die schon 1968 während eines Protests gegen den Vietnam-Krieg besetzt worden war.
Protestwelle im ganzen Land
Auch andere Universitäten sind längst von der Protestwelle erfasst worden. Laut US-Medien wurden seit Beginn der Unmutsbekundungen im ganzen Land mehr als 1000 Demonstranten vorläufig festgenommen - gestern griff die Polizei unter anderem in den Bundesstaaten Kalifornien, Georgia und North Carolina ein.
Am Montag hatte die Columbia-Universität angekündigt, Studentinnen und Studenten zu suspendieren, sollten sie ein Protestcamp auf dem Universitätsgelände nicht bis zum Nachmittag verlassen. Doch das Gegenteil geschah: Auf Videos vom Campus war zu sehen, wie Vermummte mit schwarz-weißen Palästinensertüchern Fenster einschlagen und den Eingang der Hamilton Hall mit Stühlen und Tischen verbarrikadieren. Nach Angaben der Studierendenzeitung «Columbia Spectator» drangen mehrere Dutzend Protestierende in das Gebäude ein, während Hunderte weitere davor demonstrierten.
Die Studierendengruppen «Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine» und «Columbia University Apartheid Divest» kündigten an, die Hamilton Hall nicht zu verlassen, bis ihre Forderungen erfüllt würden. «Ein Gebäude zu besetzen, ist ein geringes Risiko im Vergleich zum täglichen Widerstand der Palästinenser im Gazastreifen», hieß es in einer auf der Plattform X, früher Twitter, verbreiteten Stellungnahme. Die Demonstrierenden kritisieren das Vorgehen Israels im Gaza-Krieg und fordern Solidarität mit den Palästinensern. Außerdem verlangen sie von der Hochschule, finanzielle Beziehungen mit Israel zu kappen. Die Universität lehnte das bisher ab.
UN-Generalsekretär: Freie Meinungsäußerung muss möglich sein
Auch die US-Regierung reagierte auf die Besetzung während der Nacht: «Die gewaltsame Übernahme eines Gebäudes auf dem Campus ist der absolut falsche Weg. Das ist kein Beispiel für friedlichen Protest», sagte der Kommunikationsdirektor des Nationalen Sicherheitsrats, John Kirby. Ein kleiner Prozentsatz von Studierenden sollte nicht in der Lage sein, die akademische Ausbildung aller zu stören. «Studenten, die für ihren Universitätsbesuch bezahlen und eine Ausbildung anstreben, sollten dieser ungestört folgen können, und sie sollten sich dabei sicher fühlen können», sagte Kirby. Hassrede und Symbole des Hasses hätten in den USA keinen Platz.
UN-Generalsekretär António Guterres wandte sich ebenfalls gegen Hassrede, betonte aber auch, dass freie Meinungsäußerung möglich sein müsse. Die Universitäten sollten ihre Weisheit nutzen, um angemessen mit der Situation umzugehen.
Kritik an New Yorker Polizei
Vor knapp zwei Wochen hatte ein Einsatz der New Yorker Polizei an der Columbia-Universität für Aufsehen und Kritik gesorgt, in der Folge kam es an Dutzenden Universitäten in den USA zu Protesten und der Errichtung von Zeltlagern. Einigen Demonstrierenden wird Antisemitismus und die Verharmlosung der islamistischen Hamas vorgeworfen, deren Ziel die Vernichtung des Staates Israel ist.
Israels Präsident Izchak Herzog nannte die «entsetzlichen antisemitischen Aktionen» an der Universität Columbia zutiefst beunruhigend. «Die amerikanische Wissenschaft muss sich der Bedrohung bewusst werden», schrieb Herzog auf der Plattform X. Er sprach von «einer klaren und gegenwärtigen Gefahr für die akademische Freiheit und für das Leben der Juden auf dem Campus». Herzog forderte, antisemitische Aktionen auf dem Campus zu unterbinden.
Die Hamas und andere islamistische Gruppen hatten bei ihrem Überfall auf Israel am 7. Oktober vergangenen Jahres etwa 1200 Menschen getötet und mehr als 250 als Geiseln in den Gazastreifen verschleppt. Israel reagierte darauf mit einer Bodenoffensive und Luftangriffen auf das Küstengebiet. In der Folge wurden nach - unabhängig kaum zu verifizierenden - Angaben der von der Hamas kontrollierten Gesundheitsbehörde seit Kriegsbeginn etwa 34 500 Menschen getötet.

Article: Die Ursprünge reichen bis ins alte Ägypten zurück, wo Priester, die sich mit zahlreichen Weisheiten und außergewöhnlichen Technologien zur Manipulation von Energie und Leben auskannten, versuchten, die Welt gemäß ihrer Vision umzugestalten.
Sie stellten sich eine streng hierarchische Gesellschaft vor: eine abgestufte Struktur aus Herren, Dienern und Sklaven, wobei die Sklaven auf bloße biologische Automaten ohne persönlichen Intellekt reduziert wurden.
Um ihr Ziel zu erreichen, wählten sie einen Stamm aus, vernichteten ihn und „retteten“ ihn anschließend in die Wildnis.
Sie führten den verarmten Stamm vierzig Jahre lang durch eine Wüste, die in einer Woche hätte durchquert werden können, und versorgten den Stamm während dieser Zeit mit Grieß aus geheimen Vorräten.
Dies beschreibt die Bildung und globale Zerstreuung des „auserwählten“ Volkes, das mit strengen Anweisungen und einer geheimen Ideologie ausgestattet war.
Eine geheime Initiative zur Rekonstruktion der Welt wurde gestartet. Mit anderen Worten: Die Verschwörung ist im Gange.
Die ultimative Herausforderung für die Bevölkerung bestand darin, mit allen notwendigen Mitteln die Kontrolle über die grundlegenden Aspekte des gesellschaftlichen Lebens zu erlangen: Handel, Justiz, Gesundheitswesen, Bildung, Kultur und Wissenschaft.
Zunächst wurden Geheimbünde wie der Templerorden, der Malteserorden, der Dominikaner und die Gemeinschaft der Freimaurer gegründet.
Diese Gruppen galten als die treibenden Kräfte hinter dem Projekt, das allgemein als „Verschwörung“ bezeichnet wird. Ihnen wurde zugesichert, die größte Belohnung des Lebens zu erhalten, sollte das Projekt erfolgreich sein.
Für den Rest des Volkes wurden Religionen geschaffen . Die Ursprünge von Religionen sind komplex und vielschichtig. Sie haben in der Vergangenheit verschiedene Funktionen erfüllt, von der Bereitstellung von sozialem Zusammenhalt und gemeinsamen Ritualen bis hin zur Bereitstellung von Erklärungen für die menschliche Existenz und das Universum.
Die Glaubenssätze und Narrative innerhalb der Religionen sind vielfältig und dienen oft der Auseinandersetzung mit existenziellen Fragen und menschlichen Erfahrungen.
In allen Religionen gibt es einen gemeinsamen Glauben an das bevorstehende Ende der Welt, die Ankunft katastrophaler Ereignisse, die unvermeidliche Bestrafung von Sündern und die eventuelle Ankunft des Messias.
Den Anhängern wird oft beigebracht, alle gegen sie begangenen Gräueltaten mit Gelassenheit hinzunehmen, sie als Teil von Gottes Plan zu betrachten und auf Selbstverteidigung zu verzichten und sich stattdessen ausschließlich auf die erwartete Ankunft des Messias zu konzentrieren.
Nach der Erstellung begann die nächste Phase: die Formulierung eines umfassenden und genauen Projektplans und die Festlegung von Managementrahmen.
Um diesem Ziel zu dienen, wurde ein Zweig der katholischen Kirche gegründet, der 1534 zur Gründung des Jesuitenordens führte, gefolgt von der Gründung der Illuminaten im Jahr 1776 unter der Führung des Malteserordens.
Anschließend übernahmen die Illuminaten die Kontrolle über die Freimaurer. Verschiedene andere Geheimorden übernahmen bedeutende Aufgaben und erweiterten den Umfang der Jesuiten-Malteser-Illuminaten-Operationen.
Das 20. Jahrhundert ist angekommen. Die wichtigsten gesellschaftlichen Veränderungen, die für den Aufbau der Neuen Weltordnung notwendig waren, fanden statt, nämlich: die Einführung einer einheitlichen Währung (der Dollar), die Schaffung supranationaler Strukturen (UN, WHO usw.) zur Kontrolle nationaler Regierungen und Parlamente usw.
Die Energieversorgung in allen Ländern wurde von den Projektteilnehmern geleitet.
Die verbleibende Aufgabe besteht darin, die letzte Phase durchzuführen, die in den „Schriften“ als Apokalypse bekannt ist und die Enthüllung bedeutet. Diese Phase wird in der Bibel als „Offenbarung des Evangelisten Johannes“ bezeichnet.
Der Begriff „Apokalypse“ wurde erstmals mit Oktober 2019 in Verbindung gebracht. Am 18. und 19. Oktober wurde eine Übung namens „Event 201“ durchgeführt, bei der eine Coronavirus-Pandemie simuliert wurde.
Drei Tage vor diesem Ereignis soll der metaphorische „erste Reiter der Apokalypse“ die Bühne betreten haben und die Pest symbolisieren.
Die Situation eskalierte schnell. Aufgrund der aktuellen Projektphase ist die Zeit knapp. Der Reiter auf dem roten Pferd, das den Krieg symbolisiert, hat seinen Zug bereits gemacht (wir wollen uns nicht weiter mit ihm befassen).
Bei einem kürzlichen Vorfall am 24. April 2024 in London wurden zwei Pferde, ein schwarzes und ein weißes, durch die Straßen stürmen gesehen, wobei das weiße Pferd offenbar blutverschmiert war.
Diese könnten als die letzten beiden Pferde der Apokalypse interpretiert werden : Hungersnot und Tod. Zufälligerweise blieb am selben Tag die berühmte Uhr des Londoner Big Ben Tower um 9 Uhr stehen. Als es anschließend für 10 Uhr klingeln sollte, ertönte es elfmal und erinnerte damit an den Code 9/11.
Tatsächlich wurde der Termin für diese Aufführung nicht zufällig ausgewählt; Schau mal:
Bemerkenswert ist, dass König Charles vor einem Jahr auf einem schwarzen Pferd gesehen wurde, was eine bedeutende Ankündigung zu sein schien.
Sie verbergen nichts mehr und wissen, dass nichts ihren Fortschritt aufhalten kann. Ihre Fähigkeit zur Geheimhaltung und ihre offenen Lügen, gepaart mit der grenzenlosen Leichtgläubigkeit und Leichtgläubigkeit der Menschheit, haben ihren Zweck erfüllt.
In den aufgezeichneten Geboten der Illuminaten aus dem Jahr 1776 heißt es:
- Da die Ziele der Illuminati gerechtfertigt sind, rechtfertigen sie den Einsatz aller notwendigen Mittel zu ihrer Verwirklichung.
-
Das Recht zu lügen ist legitim.
-
Unsere Ressourcen und ihr Einfluss sollten verborgen bleiben, bis sie so gewaltig werden, dass keine andere Kraft oder ein anderer Plan sie schwächen kann.
Entgegen mancher Annahme ist auf dem Ein-Dollar-Schein nicht das Gründungsdatum der Vereinigten Staaten in römischen Ziffern abgebildet – 1776. Stattdessen markiert dieses Datum die Gründung des Illuminati-Ordens, dessen Gründungstag der 1. Mai ist, der symbolische Bedeutung hat .
Darüber hinaus wird die Banknote oft als umfassende Darstellung des Konzepts der „Neuen Weltordnung“ zitiert.
Der einzige Ausweg aus dieser schlimmen Situation ist die universelle Erleuchtung und das Erwachen.
Dieses Konzept wurde schon oft erwähnt und in verschiedenen Filmen und Zeichentrickfilmen anschaulich dargestellt.
Beispielsweise heißt es im Zeichentrickfilm „Fantastic Planet“ (La Planete Sauvage) von 1973 und in der jüngsten Fortsetzung „In Shadow“ ausdrücklich, dass wir uns für den Sieg ihr Wissen aneignen müssen.
Dennoch bleibt die Bevölkerung zutiefst ahnungslos und völlig getäuscht, bis zu dem Punkt, an dem ein Massenerwachen unmöglich erscheint.
Folglich werden ihre Symbole und Zeichen jetzt offenkundig zur Schau gestellt und nicht länger versteckt, da sie eine Geheimhaltung für unnötig halten. Um den Beschluss der Verschwörer zu wiederholen:
„Unsere Ressourcen und ihr Einfluss sollten verborgen bleiben, bis sie so gewaltig werden, dass keine andere Macht oder ein anderer Plan sie schwächen kann.“

Article: Wer eine produktive Arbeit mit gutem Ergebnis beendet hat, der kann sich an diesem Produkt erfreuen und einen gewissen Stolz ob seiner Leistung empfinden.
Das motiviert zu neuen Taten und im Verlauf seines Lebens wird er eine Menge an Arbeit leisten, die ihn dann auf ein erfülltes Leben zufrieden zurückblicken lässt. Von Peter Haisenko
Er kann stolz auf seine Lebensleistung sein. Was geschieht aber, wenn in einer politisch korrekten Welt Stolz nicht mehr zugelassen wird?
Stolz ist ein naher Verwandter von Freude. Nicht zu verwechseln mit Hochmut oder Arroganz. Eltern können stolz auf ihre Kinder sein, Freude an ihnen haben, wenn sich diese gut entwickeln. Es gibt aber auch andere Formen von Stolz.
Zum Beispiel Nationalstolz. Dann freut man sich, zu einer Nation zu gehören. Wenn dem so ist, wird man daran mitarbeiten, dass dieser Stolz auch gerechtfertigt bleibt. Man bringt sich mit ganzem Herzen ein und leistet freudig seinen Teil dazu.
Nationalstolz ist ein wichtiges Bindeglied für die Gesellschaft. Nehmen wir beispielhaft die USA. Ganz gleich, welcher politischen Ausrichtung ein Amerikaner ist, er ist stolz darauf, zur „Worlds leading Nation“ zu gehören. Man ist an erster Stelle Amerikaner und erst danach kommen all die politischen Differenzen. Das unterscheidet die USA von der BRD.
In den meisten Ländern ist die Nationalflagge geradezu heilig. Wird sie beschädigt oder ihr nicht der angemessene Respekt erwiesen, macht man sich strafbar. Gerade in den USA, unserem großen Vorbild, hängen überall die Nationalflaggen. Auch vor privaten Häusern. In den meisten Staaten würde ein Staatschef umgehend entlassen, wenn er der Nationalflagge zu wenig Respekt erweist.
In der BRD hingegen hat die Kanzlerin eine kleine Deutschlandfahne mit deutlicher Abscheu aus dem Blickfeld entsorgt und war danach immer noch Kanzlerin.
Mit dem Ukrainekonflikt waren in der BRD mehr Ukraine-Flaggen zu sehen, als die deutsche. Zur anstehenden Fussball-EM in der BRD wurde darauf hingewiesen, dass das Zeigen der Deutschlandfahne nicht erwünscht ist. Wer diese Fahne in den Vorgarten hängt, ist ein Fall für den Verfassungsschutz als mutmaßlicher Rechtsextremist.
Die BRD ist ein rezessives Modell
In der BRD ist jegliche Form von Nationalstolz verpönt, ja man könnte sagen, verboten. Will man als Autor oder Filmemacher ein gesichertes Auskommen haben, muss man nur Bücher über die Gräueltaten der Wehrmacht oder der SS schreiben oder „Dokus“ herstellen, die zeigen sollen, wie schrecklich und menschenverachtend die Zeit unter Hitler in Deutschland war.
Dass diese Bücher nahezu unverkäuflich sind, spielt für das Autorenhonorar keine Rolle. Dafür werden die „Dokus“ andauernd auf allen Nebenkanälen des ÖRR gezeigt bis zum Überdruss. Schließlich muss auch den Jungen Deutschen beigebracht werden, dass sie zu einer „Köterrasse“ gehören, die kein Recht auf irgendeinen Nationalstolz haben kann.
Und ja, es wurde gerichtlich festgehalten, dass es erlaubt ist, die Deutschen als „Köterrasse“ zu bezeichnen. Das müssen die jungen Deutschen verinnerlichen, die wegen der „Gnade der späten Geburt“ keinerlei Anteil an dem haben können, was vor 1945 geschehen ist.
Der politisch korrekte Deutsche schämt sich seiner Herkunft. Keinesfalls darf es sein, dass man stolz darauf ist, zum ehedem deutschen Volk der Dichter und Denker zu gehören, sein Erbe zu bewahren.
Wer die deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft erwerben will, muss ein Bekenntnis abgeben, Israel immer und überall schützen und fördern zu wollen. Wie kann man da erwarten, dass sich ein stolzer Türke, Araber oder gar Spanier in eine Gesellschaft integrieren, ja assimilieren will, wenn man dafür jeglichen Stolz auf seine neue Staatsbürgerschaft ablegen muss?
Wenn man Mitglied einer Nation wird, die als höchstes Gut die Erinnerung an schlimme Taten der Vorväter pflegt und feiert und alles Gedenken an die Großleistungen Deutscher vor 1933 dem Vergessen überantwortet? In einem Land, in dem es keine Vorbilder gibt, die man verehren könnte?
Der volltrunkene Kanzler hält eine Rede
Am 10. 10. 1973 war ich mit einem kleinen Verlag auf der Frankfurter Buchmesse. Am Abend hielt Willy Brandt die Rede zur Eröffnung. Er war derart betrunken, dass er keinen einzigen Satz korrekt zu Ende bringen konnte.
DAS war also mein Bundeskanzler. Spätestens da habe ich jeglichen Respekt vor Rang und Namen verloren. Aber das Problem war weitreichender. In der gesamten deutschen Politik konnte ich niemanden identifizieren, den ich für mich und mein Leben als Vorbild nehmen könnte. Als Pilot und Kapitän habe ich viele Politiker an Bord meiner Flugzeuge erlebt.
Da gab es „große Namen“, die morgens um 09:00 Uhr volltrunken ins Cockpit kamen, um über ihre Großtaten zu schwadronieren. Genau genommen gab es nur einen einzigen, der sich so benahm, wie man es sich von einem Würdenträger wünschen darf: Franz Josef Strauß. Der war aber als mögliches Vorbild verpönt. So musste ich mein Leben führen, ohne mich an (politischen) Vorbildern orientieren zu können.
Ganz aktuell hat sich diese Situation nicht verbessert. Im Gegenteil zieht sich durch die Geschichte der BRD eine Abfolge von Betrug und Lügen bis in die höchsten Ebenen.
Wer wollte sich heute ein Mitglied aus der Regierung als Vorbild nehmen, es sei denn, er ist ein Psychopath wie diese selbst? Ist es möglich Stolz zu empfinden ob der Auftritte und Leistungen dieser Mitglieder unserer Regierung, die das Bild Deutschlands in die Welt tragen?
Die unser Land ruinieren und der Lächerlichkeit preisgeben? Wer sich noch etwas Nationalstolz erhalten will, der muss sich auf auf die großen Komponisten, Ingenieure, Physiker und Philosophen der letzten Jahrhunderte beschränken.
Für das, was gerade abläuft, kann man sich nicht nur, man muss sich schämen. Ach ja, im Abwasser des Bundestags wurden erhebliche Mengen an Kokain festgestellt. Da sitzen also eine Menge an Koksern, die über die Geschicke unseres Landes bestimmen. Früher Alkohol, heute Kokain.
Worauf sind Amerikaner eigentlich stolz?
Betrachtet man die Geschichte der USA, so tue ich mir schwer etwas zu entdecken, das zumindest unter moralischen Aspekten einen Nationalstolz rechtfertigen könnte. Nicht nur, dass man dort die eingeborene Bevölkerung nahezu vollständig ausgerottet hat, waren vor allem die Südstaaten die größten Importeure für Sklaven aus Afrika.
Man könnte sagen, während der letzten 500 Jahre waren die USA die einzigen, die Sklaven en Masse importiert haben. Und die deutschen Lande? Die waren die einzige Seefahrernation in Europa, die sich nie am Sklavenhandel beteiligt und bereichert hat. In Deutschland hat es niemals Sklavenhaltung gegeben. Deutschland war eines der wenigen Länder, in denen es vor Hitler keinen Rassismus gab.
Nirgendwo waren Juden besser integriert, mit allen bürgerlichen Rechten ausgestattet, als im Deutschen Reich. Ja, darauf kann man Stolz sein, aber auch das wird den Deutschen im Bildungskanon vorenthalten.
Keine Nation, kein Staat oder Land kann auf Dauer existieren, ohne ein gewisses Maß an Nationalstolz. Niemand wird ein Land bewundern, das als höchste Tugend die Selbstbeschmutzung zur Staatsräson gemacht hat. Warum läuft es in Bayern besser als im Rest der BRD? Auch was Probleme mit Migranten betrifft? Ganz einfach: Weil in Bayern noch ein gewisser Rest an Stolz vorhanden ist.
Mir san mir, sagt man und wer hierher kommen will, der soll sich gefälligst den bairischen Gepflogenheiten anpassen. Wir sind Stolz auf die Königsschlösser und von manchen wird der „Kini“ immer noch verehrt.
Als Bayer ist man nicht „rezessiv“ wie weiter im Norden. Warum wird dem englischen Königshaus in Deutschland so viel freundliche Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet? Weil wir in der BRD ein Defizit, geradezu ein Vakuum haben an Persönlichkeiten, die auch nur einen Hauch an Verehrung verdient hätten; auf die wir stolz sein könnten.
Der Niedergang beginnt mit der Sprache
Eine Nation, die Nationalstolz in sein Gegenteil gewandelt hat, muss über Kurz oder Länger untergehen. Eine Nation, die nicht einmal ihre Sprache als solche pflegt, sie mit „Rechtschreibreformen“ immer unklarer macht, mit zahllosen und unsinnigen Anglizismen verunstaltet, wird in einer babylonischen Sprachverwirrung landen und gerade da sind wir schon mittendrin.
Ein Land, in dem nicht einmal mehr im ÖRR ein korrektes Deutsch gesprochen und „Gender-Deutsch“ zur Norm erhoben wird, kann nicht überleben. Und nein, es heißt auf Deutsch nicht „für was“ oder „wegen was“ sondern wofür oder weswegen. Da weiß man dann auch, warum der Genitiv statt des Dativs angebracht ist.
Wer mit sich selbst nicht im Reinen ist, keinen Selbstrespekt hat, der kann auch nicht erwarten, von anderen respektiert zu werden. Der kann nicht erwarten, dass andere seine Freundschaft suchen oder ihn gar als Vorbild nehmen wollen.
Das gilt für Individuen und für ganze Staaten. Wie kann ein Land prosperieren, das einen Wirtschaftsminister kürt, der „mit seinem Land (Deutschland) noch nie etwas anfangen“ konnte? Wie kann man von so einem Mensch erwarten, dass er seinem Amtseid gerecht wird?
Die Umerziehung hat zum Selbsthass geführt
Der deutsche Selbsthass wurde in jahrzehntelanger Umerziehungsarbeit gezielt hergestellt um die deutsche Nation endgültig zu zerstören. Das trägt jetzt Früchte indem die führenden deutschen(!) Politiker dieses 150-Jahre alte Ziel der Engländer vollenden. Wirtschaft, Kultur, Moral und Ehre sind in der BRD schon weitgehend zerstört.
Da lachen sich die Angelsachsen halbtot, wenn deutsche Politiker das vollenden, was sie in zwei Kriegen nicht geschafft haben. Die wissen es nämlich: Keine Nation kann ohne ein angemessenes Maß an Stolz überleben.
Sie praktizieren das in ihren eigenen Ländern, indem sie alles ausblenden, worauf man nun gar nicht stolz sein kann, sein darf.
Nur die Deutschen sind so selbstzerstörerisch, dass sie sich jeglichen Nationalstolz verbieten. Man darf nicht einmal stolz darauf sein, wie schnell es gelungen ist, Deutschland nach dem Krieg wieder aufzubauen. Selbst diese Leistung wird von manchen Deutschlandhassern jetzt den Gastarbeitern zugeschrieben.
Welchen Weg ein Land, eine Nation geht, gehen muss, das keinen Nationalstolz zulässt, kann man gut am Zustand der BRD erkennen, in der man so tief gesunken ist, dass nicht einmal ansatzweise aufgeklärt wird, wer uns die Gasversorgung gesprengt hat.
Ach ja, es könnte sonst sein, dass jemand Stolz empfindet, weil es gelungen ist, die Täter zumindest zu benennen.
Der Selbsthass geht bis in die Schulen. An einer Riesaer Schule in Sachsen wurden Schüler mit der Note 6 bestraft, weil sie die Deutsche Nationalhymne singen wollten: (Schulskandal in Sachsen: Schüler bekommen eine Sechs, weil sie Nationalhymne singen wollen)

Article: Menschen werden in Batterien verwandelt, um das digitale KI-Gefängnis mit Strom zu versorgen.
Das 248-seitige Patent für die Moderna-Technologie, die Menschen im Rahmen der COVID-Impfungen verabreicht wurde, wurde im Jahr 2020 angemeldet.
Das Patent listet mehrere Ausführungsformen oder Variationen dieser Technologie auf. Und obwohl wir nicht wissen, wer welche Ausführungsform erhalten hat, wissen wir, dass mehrere unterschiedliche Chargennummern eingesetzt wurden.
Und einige waren weitaus tödlicher als andere.
Laut Moderna-Patent enthält diese Technologie selbstorganisierte Nanopartikel. Und in bestimmten Varianten können diese Nanopartikel zur kontrollierten Freisetzung von Verbindungen im menschlichen Körper eingesetzt werden.
Diese Lipid-Nanopartikel sind in ein Polymerhydrogel eingekapselt, eine Beschichtung mit kontrollierter Freisetzung, die Polyvinyle enthält. Dies wurde durch die Forschung von Ana Mihalcea und Clifford Carnicom bestätigt. (Horrorberichte nach COVID-Impfungen: Medizinische Fachkraft beschreibt erschütternde Todesfälle und Krankheitsbilder (Videos))
In einem TEDMED-Vortrag 2013 sagt Dr. Ido Bachelet, dass diese Nanoroboter in Israel bereits erfolgreich entwickelt wurden. Und dass sie mit einer einfachen Spritze in den Körper injiziert werden können.
Er zeigt ein Bild davon, wie sie aussehen, und es scheint sich um dieselben Strukturen zu handeln, die die Fünfte Kolonne bei ihrer Forschung gefunden und behauptet hat, dass sie mit 5G betrieben werden, was von Dr. Bachelet bestätigt wurde.
„Mein Team hat Nanoroboter entwickelt, die eine Antenne tragen. Diese Antennen bestehen aus Metallnanopartikeln. Die Antenne ermöglicht es den Nanobots nun, auf von außen angelegte elektromagnetische Felder zu reagieren. Diese Version von Nanobots kann also tatsächlich per Knopfdruck auf einem Joystick aktiviert werden.“ ~ Dr. Ido Bachelet
Im folgenden Video wird es von Entwicklern im Jahr 2015 diskutiert.
Der von uns entworfene und hergestellte Nanoroboter ist eine Maschine, die so programmiert werden kann, dass sie Zielzellen autonom erkennt und Nutzlasten an diese Zellen liefert. ~ Dr. Ido Bachelet
Die Grundidee besteht also darin, einen Käfig oder Korb herzustellen, der eine zerbrechliche, giftige oder wertvolle Nutzlast schützt und sie nur im richtigen Moment freigibt. ~ George Church
Der von uns entworfene Nanoroboter sieht tatsächlich aus wie ein offenes Fass oder eine Muschelschale mit zwei Hälften. Die beiden Hälften dieses offenen Fasses oder dieser Muschelschale sind also durch flexible DNA-Scharniere miteinander verbunden, und die gesamte Struktur wird durch Riegel oder Schlösser verschlossen, bei denen es sich in Wirklichkeit um DNA-Doppelhelixe handelt.
Die Funktionsweise besteht darin, dass in Abwesenheit des Schlüssels, bei dem es sich um ein Molekül oder Protein handelt, die Duplexe ausreichend stark gehalten werden, um die gesamte Struktur geschlossen zu halten.
Aber wenn der Schlüssel vorhanden ist, schaltet sich das Stück DNA, das wir zur Erkennung dieses Schlüssels entwickelt haben, um, um sich an diesen Schlüssel zu binden, und der Duplex-Reißverschluss öffnet sich. ~ Dr. Ido Bachelet
Die Arbeit des Teams von Todd Callender bei vaxxchoice.com kam zu dem Schluss, dass diese Impfungen eine Vielzahl synthetischer Krankheitserreger enthalten, die mit externen 5G-Frequenzen freigesetzt werden können.
Das Moderna-Patent beschreibt diese Nanopartikel-Nachahmer, die die Übertragung einer Vielzahl von Krankheitserregern nachahmen, und listet über hundert davon im Patent auf.
Und laut der Arbeit bei vaxxchoice haben diese synthetischen Krankheitserreger jeweils eine IP-Adresse, sie werden vom Energieministerium katalogisiert und sie verwenden Cäsium-137, mit dem wir aus der Umwelt kontaminiert wurden, als Baustein für ihren Aufbau in unserem Körper mithilfe externer Frequenzen.
Und ihre Forschung zeigt, dass das im Jahr 2020 von Microsoft angemeldete Kryptowährungssystem 060606, das Körperaktivitätsdaten nutzt , jetzt in Kraft ist und dass diese Technologie den menschlichen Körper in eine Antenne verwandelt, die Energie abgeben kann.
Das bedeutet, dass Menschen in Batterien verwandelt werden, um das digitale KI-Gefängnis zu betreiben, das um uns herum gebaut wird. Und wenn Sie sich dazu entschließen, dem nicht nachzukommen, verfügt die Technologie über einen Notausschalter.
Dank vieler unabhängiger Forscher und Wissenschaftler sind wir dabei, ihre Agenda zu ermitteln.
Aber sie bewegen sich weiterhin frei unter uns, ungehindert von jeglicher Gerechtigkeit.

Arzt entdeckt riesige “Struktur” im Blut einer geimpften Frau: “WAS IST DAS?
Der Arzt Wilfredo Stokes Baltazar aus Guatemala zeigt in einem Video das Blut einer 53-jährigen Patientin aus New York. Sie hat zwei Pfizer-Impfungen erhalten und wurde zehnmal auf Corona getestet.
Im Blut ist ein riesiges „Gebilde“ in der Größe von mindestens 2000 verklumpten roten Blutkörperchen zu sehen. Diese Ansammlung von Blutzellen wird auch als Erythrozytenaggregation bezeichnet.
Die Patientin leidet unter starker Müdigkeit und hat in ihrem Heimatland viele Ärzte konsultiert, die ihr jedoch alle gesagt haben, dass alles in Ordnung sei. Sie leidet auch unter schweren neurologischen Problemen und Gelenkschmerzen.
Stokes Baltazar warnt, dass die Frau an diesen Blutproblemen, der sogenannten Blutdyskrasie, sterben kann. „Deshalb ist sie so müde.“
„Das ist eine der Überraschungen von Pfizer“, sagt der Arzt über die Struktur im Blut. „Das führt natürlich zu Thrombosen.“
Er plädiert dafür, die Impfung sofort zu stoppen. „Viele Menschen sind daran gestorben.“
„Es ist eine Todsünde“, betont Stokes Baltazar und spricht von „Mord“.
Schätzungsweise 80 Prozent der US-Bürger würden sterben, sagt der Arzt.
Die Menschen, die ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert wurden, starben nicht an Corona. Sie wurden an Beatmungsgeräte angeschlossen und getötet.

Article: In den letzten zehn Jahren habe ich viele Artikel geschrieben, in denen ich die Beweise für biologische Schäden durch nichtionisierende elektromagnetische Felder (EMF) und Hochfrequenzstrahlung (RFR) aus drahtlosen Technologien diskutiert habe.
Das obige Video zeigt ein Interview, das ich im Februar 2020 mit Siim Land für seinen Body Mind Empowerment-Podcast geführt habe, in dem ich über EMF spreche – was es ist, Ihre größten Expositionsquellen, wie es Ihre Biologie beeinflusst und wie Sie Ihre Exposition minimieren können. Ich gehe auch darauf ein, wie die Telekommunikationsindustrie die Wahrheit manipuliert, um Sie über die möglichen Gefahren im Unklaren zu lassen.
Während die Mobilfunkindustrie davon ausgeht, dass die einzige Art von Strahlung, die Schaden anrichten kann, die ionisierende Strahlung ist – zum Beispiel Röntgenstrahlen -, warnen Forscher seit langem davor, dass auch nichtionisierende und nicht heizende Strahlung Ihre Gesundheit gefährden kann. Dies gilt nicht nur für die menschliche Gesundheit, sondern auch für die von Pflanzen und Tieren.
Im Laufe der Zeit war ich von den schädlichen Auswirkungen von EMF so überzeugt, dass ich drei Jahre brauchte, um “EMF*D” zu schreiben, das 2020 veröffentlicht wurde. Darin überprüfte ich die überwältigenden Beweise, die zeigen, dass EMF eine versteckte Gesundheitsgefahr darstellen, die einfach nicht länger ignoriert werden kann.
Während der Pandemie wurden wir auch Zeuge der Einführung und Installation von 5G im ganzen Land, was die Exposition exponentiell erhöht hat, da es zusätzlich zu der bereits bestehenden drahtlosen Infrastruktur hinzugefügt wurde.
Das kurze Video unten, das von Investigative Europe im Januar 2019 veröffentlicht wurde, gibt einen kurzen Überblick darüber, wie sich 5G von der bisherigen Funktechnologie unterscheidet. Zum damaligen Zeitpunkt gab es nur wenige oder gar keine Forschungsarbeiten zu 5G, aber zwischen 2022 und 2024 wurden zehn neue Studien veröffentlicht, die mehr Licht in diese Technologie der fünften Generation bringen.
5G-Moratoriumsaufrufe trotz Beweisen ignoriert
Der erste davon, der im September 2022 in der Zeitschrift Reviews on Environmental Health veröffentlicht wurde, bietet einen guten Überblick über die Gefahren, die von 5G ausgehen. Die Autoren wiesen darauf hin, dass seit September 2017 über 400 Wissenschaftler und Ärzte gemeinsam sechs Appelle an die Europäische Union gerichtet haben, in denen sie ein Moratorium für die 5G-Technologie forderten. Alle wurden ignoriert.
Der Appell vom September 2021 enthielt ein “umfangreiches Anschreiben”, in dem Experten argumentierten, dass das Vertrauen der EU auf die Richtlinien der Internationalen Kommission zum Schutz vor nichtionisierender Strahlung (ICNIRP) die öffentliche Gesundheit gefährdet, da die Richtlinien nur “die Erwärmung und keine anderen gesundheitsrelevanten biologischen Auswirkungen von RFR” berücksichtigen.
Das Schreiben stellt den ICNIRP-Leitlinien Forschungsergebnisse europäischer und internationaler Expertengruppen entgegen, die zahlreiche negative biologische Auswirkungen von RFR auf Mensch und Umwelt aufzeigen. (Ob Handy, Computer oder in der Küche: Mikrowellen – ein oft unterschätzter unsichtbare Begleiter unseres Alltag)
Laut den Autoren:
“Die Beweise für diese Position stammen aus Studien, die Veränderungen bei Neurotransmittern und Rezeptoren, Schäden an Zellen, Proteinen, DNA, Spermien, dem Immunsystem und der menschlichen Gesundheit, einschließlich Krebs, zeigen.
Der Appell 2021 warnt weiter, dass 5G-Signale wahrscheinlich zusätzlich das Verhalten von Sauerstoff- und Wassermolekülen auf der Quantenebene verändern, Proteine entfalten, die Haut schädigen und Insekten, Vögeln, Fröschen, Pflanzen und Tieren Schaden zufügen.”
Bündelung von Signalen wirft ernste Fragen auf
Unter der Überschrift “Great Plans, Great Promises but False Claims” (Große Pläne, große Versprechungen, aber falsche Behauptungen) heben die Autoren die eigenen Erkenntnisse der Regierung hervor:
“… die potenziellen Gesundheits- und Sicherheitsrisiken im Zusammenhang mit RFR wurden in einer kürzlich von der EU in Auftrag gegebenen Überprüfung der derzeit verfügbaren wissenschaftlichen Beweise, dem EPRS/STOA-Bericht über die gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen von 5G aus dem Jahr 2021 des Europäischen Parlamentarischen Forschungsdienstes, aufgezeigt.
In den Schlussfolgerungen der umfassenden Überprüfung wurde erklärt, dass es genügend Beweise für Krebs durch RFR bei Tieren gibt, dass es genügend Beweise für schädliche Auswirkungen von RFR auf die Fruchtbarkeit von Männern, männlichen Ratten und Mäusen gibt, und dass RFR wahrscheinlich krebserregend für Menschen ist.
Kurz gesagt, der EPRS/STOA-Bericht zeigt, dass RFR gesundheitsschädlich ist. Der Bericht fordert daraufhin Maßnahmen, die Anreize zur Verringerung der HF-EMF-Belastung schaffen (S. 153), wie z. B. die Senkung des Grenzwerts für die zulässige Belastung und die bevorzugte Nutzung von kabelgebundenen Verbindungen.
Ähnlich verhält es sich mit der eingehenden Analyse der EU (ITRE-Ausschuss) von 2019, 5G Deployment: State of Play in Europe, USA and Asia” davor gewarnt, dass 5G zusammen mit 2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi, WIMAX, DECT, Radar usw. zu einer dramatisch höheren Gesamtstrahlung führen wird: nicht nur durch die Verwendung viel höherer Frequenzen in 5G, sondern auch durch das Potenzial für die Aggregation verschiedener Signale, ihre dynamische Natur und die komplexen Interferenzeffekte, die sich daraus ergeben können, insbesondere in dichten städtischen Gebieten (S. 11).
Diese Bedenken beruhen auf der Komplexität der Kommunikationssignale und den Unbekannten ihrer Wechselwirkungen. Elektromagnetische Signale, die von künstlichen Kommunikationsgeräten übertragen werden, sind keine normalen Wellen, sondern eine komplexe Kombination aus ultrahochfrequenten Trägerwellen und Modulationen, die die Nachrichten mit extrem niedrigen und ultraniedrigen Frequenzen kodieren.
Darüber hinaus werden die Signale mit extrem niedrigen Frequenzen gepulst (in kurzen Ein-Aus-Stößen gesendet). Das bedeutet, dass die RFR-Trägerwellen zwar im hochfrequenten GHz-Bereich liegen, ihre Modulationen und Pulsraten aber viel näher an den Frequenzen der Gehirnströme sind, z. B. das 217-Hz-Pulsieren eines GSM-Telefonsignals.
Gepulste oder modulierte RFR-Signale sind nachweislich bioaktiver als einfache Dauerwellen gleicher Intensität und Expositionsdauer. Dies ist in Bezug auf die öffentliche Gesundheit sehr bedenklich und beschränkt sich nicht nur auf die höheren 5G-Frequenzen.
Darüber hinaus hat der Bericht festgestellt, dass die Auswirkungen dieser neuen komplexen, strahlenförmigen Signale unvorhersehbare Ausbreitungsmuster haben, die zu einer inakzeptablen Exposition des Menschen gegenüber elektromagnetischer Strahlung führen könnten (S. 6), aber noch nicht zuverlässig für reale Situationen außerhalb des Labors kartiert wurden.”
5G kann zu neurologischen und psychiatrischen Problemen führen
Die zweite Studie, die im November 2022 veröffentlicht wurde, untersuchte die Auswirkungen von 4,9 GHz (eine von mehreren 5G-Frequenzen) RFR auf das emotionale Verhalten und das räumliche Gedächtnis bei erwachsenen männlichen Mäusen. Es wurde festgestellt, dass die Exposition “depressionsähnliches Verhalten” hervorruft, das durch “neuronale Pyroptose in der Amygdala” verursacht wird.
Pyroptose ist eine Form des programmierten Zelltods, die sich von anderen Formen der Apoptose unterscheidet und durch eine entzündliche Reaktion gekennzeichnet ist. Dabei schwillt die Zelle an und platzt, was zur Freisetzung von entzündungsfördernden Zytokinen und intrazellulären Inhalten führt, die im umliegenden Gewebe eine Immunreaktion auslösen können.
Dieser Prozess wird durch Gasdermin-Proteine gesteuert, die Poren in der Zellmembran bilden, und wird häufig als Reaktion auf Infektionen durch Krankheitserreger oder andere Signale, die auf eine Zellschädigung hinweisen, ausgelöst.
“5G löst den Zelltod in der Amygdala aus, einer Hirnregion, die an der Emotionsregulation, dem Gedächtnis und der Entscheidungsfindung beteiligt ist.”
Die Amygdala ist ein Bereich des Gehirns, der an der Emotionsregulation, dem Gedächtnis und der Entscheidungsfindung beteiligt ist. Daher könnte Pyroptose in diesem Bereich ein Hinweis auf neurologische Schäden oder Entzündungen sein, die sich möglicherweise auf die Emotionsregulation, das Verhalten und die kognitiven Funktionen auswirken.
Dies könnte im Zusammenhang mit neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen, Hirnverletzungen oder Infektionen von Bedeutung sein, die das zentrale Nervensystem beeinträchtigen und zu verschiedenen neurologischen und psychiatrischen Folgen führen.
Vier Studien bestätigen die Auswirkungen von 5G auf die Neurologie
Vier weitere Studien, die 2023 veröffentlicht wurden, zeigen ebenfalls eine Vielzahl von Schäden im Gehirn:
5G erhöht die Durchlässigkeit der Blut-Hirn-Schranke – In der ersten Studie wurde festgestellt, dass HF-Strahlung von 5G-Mobiltelefonen bei 3,5 GHz oder 4,9 GHz für eine Stunde pro Tag über 35 Tage hinweg die Durchlässigkeit der Blut-Hirn-Schranke in der Großhirnrinde von Mäusen erhöht.
RFR beeinträchtigt die Neurogenese und verursacht neuronale DNA-Schäden– In der zweiten Studie wurde gezeigt, dass kontinuierliche RFR von Mobiltelefonen bei 2115 MHz für acht Stunden höhere Werte von Lipidperoxidation, kohlenstoffzentrierten Lipidradikalen und Einzelstrang-DNA-Schäden induziert, was zu einer beeinträchtigten Neurogenese in der Hippocampus-Region und neuronaler Degeneration in der Gyrus dentatus-Region führt. Übersetzung: Handystrahlung kann kognitive Beeinträchtigungen und Defizite, Verhaltensänderungen und dysfunktionale Stimmungsregulierung, neurodegenerative Störungen (aufgrund des oxidativen Stresses innerhalb der Neuronen) und psychiatrische Erkrankungen wie Angst und Depression verursachen.
Elektromagnetische Strahlung in Verbindung mit Angstzuständen – In dieser Studie wurde bei männlichen Mäusen, die 28 Tage lang vier Stunden täglich elektromagnetischer Strahlung bei 2650 MHz ausgesetzt waren, angstähnliches Verhalten festgestellt.
5G kann Demenz fördern – Schließlich kam eine Folgestudie zu früheren Forschungsergebnissen zu dem Schluss, dass RFRs bei 1,8 GHz bis 3,5 GHz:
Neurosin hemmen, ein Enzym, das eine Rolle für die Gesundheit des Gehirns spielt, einschließlich des Abbaus von Proteinen, die, wenn sie nicht richtig gesteuert werden, zu Krankheiten wie Alzheimer führen können. Dieser Befund deutet darauf hin, dass Handystrahlung möglicherweise die Fähigkeit des Gehirns beeinträchtigen könnte, die Ablagerung schädlicher Proteine zu verhindern.
Hemmung der elektrischen Aktivität von Neuronen in vitro – Neuronen kommunizieren miteinander über elektrische Signale, und diese Aktivität ist entscheidend für alles, was das Gehirn tut, von der Verarbeitung sensorischer Informationen bis zur Steuerung von Muskelbewegungen. Die Hemmung der elektrischen Aktivität bedeutet eine Unterbrechung der normalen Kommunikation der Gehirnzellen, was sich möglicherweise auf die Gehirnfunktionen auswirken könnte.
5G wirkt sich auf die Gehirnentwicklung aus
Eine Studie von Bodin et al. vom Oktober 2023 untersuchte die Auswirkungen einer 5G-Exposition während der perinatalen Periode – um den Zeitpunkt der Geburt herum – auf die Neuroentwicklung von Ratten. Das Hauptziel dieser Studie war es zu erforschen, wie sich die Exposition gegenüber 5G-EMF um den Zeitpunkt der Geburt auf die Gehirnentwicklung von Ratten auswirkt, wenn sie zu Jugendlichen und Heranwachsenden heranwachsen.
Sowohl männliche als auch weibliche Rattenwelpen, die 5G EMF ausgesetzt waren, zeigten einen verzögerten Ausbruch der Schneidezähne (Vorderzähne). Dies deutet darauf hin, dass die EMF-Exposition möglicherweise bestimmte Aspekte der körperlichen Entwicklung verlangsamen könnte. Die Studie fand auch bemerkenswerte Unterschiede im Verhalten je nach Geschlecht der Ratten.
Bei heranwachsenden weiblichen Ratten gab es eine signifikante Verringerung (70%) stereotyper Bewegungen, wie z.B. sich wiederholende Verhaltensmuster, im offenen Feldtest. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass die Exposition bestimmte sich wiederholende Verhaltensweisen bei weiblichen Ratten reduzieren kann. Im Gegensatz dazu zeigten männliche Ratten einen 50%igen Anstieg stereotyper Bewegungen, was darauf hindeutet, dass die gleiche Exposition zu einem Anstieg repetitiver Verhaltensweisen führte.
Kurz gesagt, die Forschungsergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die Exposition gegenüber 5G-EMF bei Werten unterhalb des regulatorischen Schwellenwerts während einer kritischen Entwicklungsphase (Perinatalperiode) das Potenzial hat, Störungen der Neuroentwicklung zu verursachen. Diese Auswirkungen sind bei jugendlichen und heranwachsenden Nachkommen zu beobachten und treten bei Männern und Frauen unterschiedlich auf.
Es ist zwar schwer vorherzusagen, welche Auswirkungen dies auf die menschliche Gesundheit haben könnte, aber es ist erwähnenswert, dass repetitive Verhaltensweisen häufig mit neurologischen Entwicklungsstörungen wie Autismus-Spektrum-Störungen (ASD) und Aufmerksamkeitsdefizit-Hyperaktivitätsstörungen (ADHS) in Verbindung gebracht werden. In solchen Fällen können diese Verhaltensweisen auf zugrundeliegende neurologische Unterschiede hinweisen und sich auf die sozialen Interaktionen, das Lernen und das tägliche Funktionieren einer Person auswirken.
In einigen Fällen können sich wiederholende Verhaltensweisen auch ein Symptom für Angstzustände, Zwangsstörungen, stressbedingte Störungen und selbstverletzende Verhaltensweisen wie das Zupfen an der Haut oder das Ziehen der Haare sein. Bei manchen Menschen können repetitive Verhaltensweisen die Aufmerksamkeit und Konzentration beeinträchtigen, was sich auf die schulischen Leistungen, die Produktivität am Arbeitsplatz und die Fähigkeit, tägliche Aufgaben effizient zu erledigen, auswirkt.
Es kann auch die sozialen Interaktionen und Beziehungen einer Person beeinträchtigen und zu sozialer Isolation, Mobbing oder Stigmatisierung führen, insbesondere bei Kindern und Jugendlichen, was wiederum das emotionale Wohlbefinden und das Selbstwertgefühl beeinträchtigt. Sich wiederholende Verhaltensweisen, insbesondere solche, die mit Angst- oder Zwangsstörungen einhergehen, können auch den Schlafrhythmus stören und zu Schlaflosigkeit oder schlechter Schlafqualität führen, was wiederum die allgemeine Gesundheit und das Wohlbefinden beeinträchtigt.
RFR dezimiert die männliche Fruchtbarkeit – Melatonin kann helfen, sie wiederherzustellen
Eine Studie vom Dezember 2023, die die negativen Auswirkungen einer Langzeitexposition bei 2100 MHz RFR auf die Eigenschaften von Rattenspermien untersuchte, brachte sowohl gute als auch schlechte Nachrichten.
Nachteilig war, dass männliche Ratten, die 30 Minuten täglich bei 2100 MHz RFR ausgesetzt waren, einen signifikant höheren Prozentsatz von Spermien mit abnormalen Formen aufwiesen. Auch die Gesamtzahl der Spermien war bei den exponierten Ratten deutlich verringert.
Bei genauerer Betrachtung der Spermienstruktur unter dem Mikroskop (der ultrastrukturellen Ebene) wurden Schäden in kritischen Teilen der Spermien beobachtet, einschließlich der:
- Akrosom, eine kappenartige Struktur, die dem Spermium hilft, in die Eizelle einzudringen
- Axonem, der zentrale Schaft des Spermienschwanzes
- Mitochondrienscheide, die die Bewegung des Spermienschwanzes antreibt
- Äußere dichte Fasern, die Teil des Spermienschwanzes sind
Die gute Nachricht ist, dass eine Melatoninergänzung diese Probleme verhindern konnte. Ratten, denen 10 Milligramm Melatonin pro Kilo Körpergewicht subkutan verabreicht wurden, wiesen eine höhere Spermienzahl auf, und der Anteil der Spermien mit normaler Form nahm zu. Außerdem wurden die ultrastrukturellen Schäden an Spermien, die durch die HF-Exposition verursacht wurden, vollständig rückgängig gemacht. Wie von den Autoren berichtet:
“Der Prozentsatz der abnormalen Spermienmorphologie war signifikant erhöht mit der RF-Exposition, während die Gesamtzahl der Spermien signifikant abnahm … Die Anzahl der gesamten Spermien, die Spermien mit normaler Morphologie nahmen zu und das ultrastrukturelle Erscheinungsbild normalisierte sich durch die Melatonin-Verabreichung.”
Fallstudie eines 8-jährigen Jungen
Im Januar 2024 präsentierten Hardell et al. eine Fallstudie über einen achtjährigen Jungen, der unter starken Kopfschmerzen und anderen Symptomen litt, während er eine Schule in der Nähe eines Mobilfunkmastes mit 5G-Basisstationen besuchte.
Die Schule des Jungen liegt 200 Meter von einem Mobilfunkmast mit 5G-Basisstationen entfernt, sein Klassenzimmer ist 285 Meter entfernt. Kurz nach seiner Einschulung begann er mit Kopfschmerzen, die anfangs nur sporadisch und nicht jeden Tag oder jede Woche auftraten.
Im Herbst 2023 verstärkten sich die Kopfschmerzen des Jungen, traten täglich auf und wurden mit 10 auf einer 10-stufigen Skala bewertet, wobei 0 für keine Beschwerden und 10 für unerträgliche Schmerzen steht. Außerdem litt er unter Müdigkeit (Note 5) und gelegentlichem Schwindel (Note 7), insbesondere in der Schule. Zu Hause hatte er gelegentlich leichte Kopfschmerzen (Note 2), die relativ schnell wieder abklangen.
Im Herbst 2023 begann er, in der Schule sowohl drinnen als auch draußen eine HF-Schutzmütze und Oberbekleidung zu tragen, woraufhin die Kopfschmerzen verschwanden.
Das Papier zitiert auch epidemiologische Studien und Laboruntersuchungen, die eine Verbindung zwischen HF-Strahlungsexposition und Krebs durch Mechanismen wie oxidativen Stress, mRNA-Effekte und DNA-Schäden herstellen, und plädiert für die Einstufung von HF-Strahlung als Karzinogen der Gruppe 1 für den Menschen, wobei es feststellt, dass “diese Einstufung erhebliche Auswirkungen auf Präventionsmaßnahmen haben sollte”.
5G verändert Ihr Mikrobiom
Schließlich untersuchte eine Studie von Wang et al. vom Februar 2024 die Auswirkungen von 5G RFR auf das fäkale Mikrobiom und die Metabolom-Profile von Mäusen. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass die Mäuse, die RFR ausgesetzt waren, signifikante Veränderungen in der Zusammensetzung ihres Darmmikrobioms erfuhren, die durch einen Rückgang der mikrobiellen Vielfalt und Verschiebungen in der Verteilung der mikrobiellen Gemeinschaft gekennzeichnet waren.
Durch Metabolomics-Profiling identifizierten die Forscher 258 Metaboliten, die in den Mäusen, die HF-Feldern ausgesetzt waren, im Vergleich zu den Kontrollen signifikant unterschiedlich häufig vorkamen, was darauf hindeutet, dass dies einen tiefgreifenden Einfluss auf Stoffwechselprozesse haben kann.
Die Autoren kamen zu dem Schluss, dass die Exposition mit 4,9 GHz RFR eine Dysbiose der Darmmikrobiota bei Mäusen verursachen kann, und stellten die Hypothese auf, dass die beobachteten Ungleichgewichte in der Darmmikrobiota und im Stoffwechsel mit dem depressionsähnlichen Verhalten von Mäusen zusammenhängen könnten, das in vielen Studien beobachtet wurde. Das Ungleichgewicht im Stoffwechselprofil könnte auch mit Veränderungen der Immunregulation oder Entzündungen einhergehen.
5G wird jedem Lebewesen schaden
Im September 2019 bat der Minister für Kommunikation, Hon. Paul Fletcher MP, den Ausschuss, eine Untersuchung über die “Einführung, Annahme und Anwendung von 5G in Australien” durchzuführen. Als Antwort darauf reichte Paul Barratt im Namen von ElectricSense ein Dokument ein, das als Download auf aph.org verfügbar ist und in dem es unter anderem heißt:
“5G ist gefährlich und wird jedem Lebewesen schaden. Tausende von Studien bringen die Exposition gegenüber schwacher drahtloser Hochfrequenzstrahlung mit einer langen Liste negativer biologischer Auswirkungen in Verbindung, darunter:
- DNA-Einzel- und Doppelstrangbrüche
- oxidative Schäden
- Störung des Zellstoffwechsels
- erhöhte Durchlässigkeit der Blut-Hirn-Schranke
- Melatonin-Reduktion
- Störung des Glukosestoffwechsels im Gehirn
- Bildung von Stressproteinen
Vergessen wir auch nicht, dass die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) im Jahr 2011 Hochfrequenzstrahlung als mögliches Karzinogen 2B eingestuft hat. Vor kurzem kam das 25 Millionen Dollar teure National Toxicology Program zu dem Schluss, dass Hochfrequenzstrahlung, wie sie derzeit von Mobiltelefonen verwendet wird, Krebs verursachen kann.
Aber wie passt 5G in all dies hinein? Da 5G Frequenzen nutzen wird, die über und unter den bestehenden Frequenzbändern liegen, befindet sich 5G in der Mitte von all dem. Aber die Tendenz (die von Land zu Land unterschiedlich ist) geht dahin, dass 5G die höheren Frequenzbänder nutzen wird. Das bringt seine eigenen Bedenken mit sich.”
Barratt listet 11 Gründe auf, die Anlass zur Sorge über die 5G-Strahlung geben, darunter:
- Stärkerer Elektrosmog
- Hautkrankheiten und Schmerzen, da “Analysen der Eindringtiefe zeigen, dass mehr als 90 % der übertragenen Leistung in der Epidermis- und Dermisschicht absorbiert wird “16
- Schädigung der Augen
- Auswirkungen auf das Herz, einschließlich Auswirkungen auf die Herzfrequenzvariabilität und Herzrhythmusstörungen
- Verminderte Immunfunktion
- Verringerte Zellwachstumsraten und Veränderungen der Zelleigenschaften und der Zellaktivität
- Erhöhtes Risiko für antibiotikaresistente Krankheitserreger
- Nekrosen bei Pflanzen und die Möglichkeit, dass pflanzliche Lebensmittel für den menschlichen Verzehr ungeeignet werden
- Auswirkungen auf die Atmosphäre und Verknappung fossiler Brennstoffe
- Störungen des Ökosystems
- Irreführende 5G-Studienergebnisse, da die meisten die Wellen nicht pulsieren. Dazu Barratt: “Dies ist wichtig, weil die Forschung über Mikrowellen bereits zeigt, dass gepulste Wellen tiefgreifendere biologische Auswirkungen auf unseren Körper haben als ungepulste Wellen. Frühere Studien haben zum Beispiel gezeigt, dass gepulste Frequenzen zu Gentoxizität und DNA-Strangbrüchen führen.
Schützen Sie sich und Ihre Familie vor übermäßiger EMF-Belastung
Es besteht kein Zweifel daran, dass die Exposition gegenüber HF-EMF eine erhebliche Gefahr darstellt, die man angehen muss, wenn man sich Sorgen um seine Gesundheit macht. Die Einführung von 5G macht Abhilfemaßnahmen sicherlich schwieriger, aber die zusätzlichen Gefahren sind ein Grund mehr, sich zu engagieren und alles zu tun, was wir können, um die Belastung zu minimieren.
Hier sind einige Vorschläge, die dazu beitragen, Ihre EMF-Belastung zu verringern und Schäden durch unvermeidbare Expositionen zu mindern. Noch mehr Tipps finden Sie in der unten stehenden Infografik des Environmental Health Trust.
- Ermitteln Sie die wichtigsten EMF-Quellen, z. B. Ihr Mobiltelefon, schnurlose Telefone, Wi-Fi-Router, Bluetooth-Headsets und andere mit Bluetooth ausgestattete Geräte, drahtlose Mäuse, Tastaturen, intelligente Thermostate, Babyphone, intelligente Messgeräte und die Mikrowelle in Ihrer Küche. Im Idealfall sollten Sie sich mit jeder Quelle befassen und herausfinden, wie Sie deren Nutzung am besten einschränken können. Sofern es sich nicht um einen lebensbedrohlichen Notfall handelt, sollten Kinder keine Handys oder drahtlosen Geräte jeglicher Art benutzen. Kinder sind aufgrund ihrer dünneren Schädelknochen weitaus stärker durch Handystrahlung gefährdet als Erwachsene. Die Forschung zeigt auch, dass Kleinkinder unter einem Jahr nicht effektiv Sprache aus Videos lernen und das, was sie auf dem iPad lernen, nicht auf die reale Welt übertragen können; es ist also ein Irrtum zu glauben, dass elektronische Geräte eine wertvolle Ausbildung bieten.
- Verbinden Sie Ihren Desktop-Computer über eine kabelgebundene Ethernet-Verbindung mit dem Internet und stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihr Desktop im Flugzeugmodus ist. Vermeiden Sie auch drahtlose Tastaturen, Trackballs, Mäuse, Spielsysteme, Drucker und tragbare Telefone. Entscheiden Sie sich für die kabelgebundenen Versionen.
- Wenn Sie Wi-Fi verwenden müssen, schalten Sie es aus, wenn Sie es nicht brauchen, insbesondere nachts, wenn Sie schlafen. Idealerweise sollten Sie darauf hinarbeiten, Ihr Haus fest zu verkabeln, damit Sie Wi-Fi ganz abschaffen können. Wenn Sie ein Notebook ohne Ethernet-Anschlüsse haben, können Sie mit einem USB-Ethernet-Adapter eine kabelgebundene Verbindung zum Internet herstellen.
- Vermeiden Sie kabellose Ladegeräte für Ihr Mobiltelefon, da auch sie die EMF in Ihrem Haus erhöhen. Kabellose Ladegeräte sind außerdem weit weniger energieeffizient als ein Dongle, der an einer Steckdose angeschlossen ist, da sie kontinuierlich Strom verbrauchen (und EMF abgeben), egal ob Sie sie benutzen oder nicht.
- Schalten Sie nachts den Strom in Ihrem Schlafzimmer ab. Dadurch werden in der Regel die von den Kabeln in der Wand ausgehenden elektrischen Felder reduziert, es sei denn, neben Ihrem Schlafzimmer befindet sich ein Nebenraum. Wenn das der Fall ist, müssen Sie mit einem Messgerät feststellen, ob Sie auch den Strom im angrenzenden Raum abschalten müssen.
- Verwenden Sie einen batteriebetriebenen Wecker, am besten einen ohne Licht.
- Wenn Sie noch einen Mikrowellenherd benutzen, sollten Sie ihn durch einen Dampfkonvektionsherd ersetzen, der Ihre Speisen genauso schnell und viel sicherer erhitzt.
- Vermeiden Sie die Verwendung von “intelligenten” Geräten und Thermostaten, die auf drahtlose Signale angewiesen sind. Das gilt auch für alle neuen “intelligenten” Fernsehgeräte. Sie werden als intelligent bezeichnet, weil sie ein Wi-Fi-Signal aussenden, das Sie im Gegensatz zu Ihrem Computer nicht abschalten können. Ziehen Sie stattdessen einen großen Computermonitor als Fernseher in Betracht, da dieser kein Wi-Fi-Signal aussendet.
- Verzichten Sie so lange wie möglich auf einen intelligenten Stromzähler in Ihrem Haus, oder fügen Sie einem vorhandenen intelligenten Stromzähler eine Abschirmung hinzu, von denen einige die Strahlung nachweislich um 98 % bis 99 % reduzieren.
- Ziehen Sie in Erwägung, das Bett Ihres Babys in Ihr Zimmer zu verlegen, anstatt ein drahtloses Babyphone zu verwenden. Alternativ können Sie auch ein fest verdrahtetes Gerät verwenden.
- Ersetzen Sie CFL-Glühbirnen durch Glühbirnen. Am besten entfernen Sie alle Leuchtstofflampen aus Ihrem Haus. Sie geben nicht nur ungesundes Licht ab, sondern übertragen auch Strom auf Ihren Körper, wenn Sie sich in der Nähe der Glühbirnen aufhalten.
- Tragen Sie Ihr Handy nicht am Körper, es sei denn, es befindet sich im Flugmodus, und schlafen Sie nie mit ihm im Schlafzimmer, es sei denn, es befindet sich im Flugmodus. Selbst im Flugzeugmodus kann es Signale aussenden, weshalb ich mein Handy in eine Faraday-Tasche stecke.
- Wenn Sie Ihr Handy benutzen, verwenden Sie den Lautsprecher und halten Sie das Telefon mindestens einen Meter von sich entfernt. Versuchen Sie, Ihre Zeit am Handy radikal zu reduzieren. Verwenden Sie stattdessen VoIP-Software-Telefone, die Sie über eine kabelgebundene Verbindung mit dem Internet nutzen können.
- Vermeiden Sie die Benutzung Ihres Mobiltelefons und anderer elektronischer Geräte mindestens eine Stunde (besser mehrere) vor dem Schlafengehen, da sowohl das blaue Licht des Bildschirms als auch die EMF die Melatoninproduktion hemmen. Die Forschung zeigt eindeutig, dass starke Computer- und Handynutzer eher zu Schlaflosigkeit neigen. So ergab eine Studie aus dem Jahr 2008, dass Menschen, die drei Stunden vor dem Schlafengehen der Strahlung ihres Mobiltelefons ausgesetzt waren, größere Schwierigkeiten hatten, einzuschlafen und einen tiefen Schlaf zu halten.
- Die Auswirkungen von EMF werden durch Kalziumkanalblocker gemindert, daher sollten Sie auf eine ausreichende Magnesiumzufuhr achten. Die meisten Menschen haben einen Magnesiummangel, der die Auswirkungen von EMF noch verschlimmert. Wie der EMF-Experte Dr. Martin Pall bereits feststellte:
“Bei Magnesiummangel kommt es zu einer übermäßigen Aktivität der VGCCs. Außerdem kommt es zu einem übermäßigen Kalziumeinstrom über den N-Methyl-D-Aspartat-Rezeptor, der durch Magnesiummangel verursacht wird, was ebenfalls problematisch ist, so dass es wichtig ist, diesen Mangel zu beheben.”
- Pall hat auch eine Arbeit veröffentlicht, die darauf hindeutet, dass eine Erhöhung des Nrf2-Spiegels helfen kann, EMF-Schäden zu lindern. Eine einfache Möglichkeit, Nrf2 zu aktivieren, ist der Verzehr von Nrf2-verstärkenden Nahrungsmitteln. Beispiele hierfür sind sulforaphanhaltiges Kreuzblütlergemüse, Lebensmittel mit hohem Gehalt an phenolischen Antioxidantien, Carotinoide (insbesondere Lycopin), Schwefelverbindungen aus Alluminosen, Isothiocyanate aus der Kohlgruppe und terpenoidreiche Lebensmittel.
- Molekularer Wasserstoff wirkt nachweislich gegen freie Radikale, die als Reaktion auf Strahlung entstehen, wie z. B. Peroxynitrite. Studien haben gezeigt, dass molekularer Wasserstoff etwa 80 % dieser Schäden abschwächen kann. Molekularer Wasserstoff aktiviert auch Nrf2, ein biologisches Hormon, das die Superoxiddismutase, Katalase und alle anderen nützlichen interzellulären Antioxidantien hochreguliert. Dies wiederum senkt Entzündungen, verbessert die Funktion der Mitochondrien und stimuliert die mitochondriale Biogenese.

Article: Wolfsburg/Langenfeld · Ein Foto und die wichtigsten Stationen des Lebenslaufs: Reicht das schon, um via Jobnetzwerk eine neue Stelle zu finden? Wohl kaum. Ein Recruiter und eine Coachin teilen ihre besten Ratschläge.
Haben Sie ein Profil bei Xing, LinkedIn oder ähnlichen Jobnetzwerken? Für Recruiterinnen und Recruiter sind sie mittlerweile enorm wichtig, wenn es um die Besetzung von Stellen geht. Dabei kommt es aber auch darauf an, wie Jobsuchende die Portale nutzen. Diese Tipps sollten sie befolgen:
1. Profil mit beruflichen Details füttern
Peter Nollido, Senior Recruiter bei Volkswagen, sucht regelmäßig auch in Jobnetzwerken nach potenziellen neuen Mitarbeitern. Dabei achte er auf ein vollständiges Profil, in dem neben bisherigen Berufsstationen vor allem Kenntnisse, Fähigkeiten oder Weiterbildungen angegeben sein sollten.
„Oft fehlen uns als Personaler genauere Details, womit die Kandidaten in ihrem beruflichen Alltag zu tun haben“, sagt Nollido. Je mehr Kenntnisse jemand angibt, desto sichtbarer werde er im Netzwerk. Dabei sollten vor allem auch fachliche Spezialisierungen Erwähnung finden, sofern sie für die Jobsuche relevant sein könnten.
2. Auf richtige Einstellungen achten
Jobsuchende sollten darauf achten, das eigene Profil offen zu schalten. Nur so können Personalerinnen und Personaler die Profilinformationen einsehen. „Berufsbezogene Daten fallen nicht unter den Datenschutz. Am Ende sehen wir auch nur den Namen der Person. Da rate ich zu etwas mehr Mut“, so Nollido.
Auch ein aktuelles Foto hält der Recruiter für sinnvoll. „Hier hat man, beispielsweise bei LinkedIn, die Möglichkeit, einen Rahmen um das Bild legen zu lassen, in dem #OpenToWork steht. Als Personaler werden wir direkt informiert, wenn ein Kandidat aus unserem Netzwerk diese Frame-Einstellung gemacht hat.“
Gehaltsvorstellungen dagegen haben nichts auf dem Profil verloren, findet der Experte. „Das kann dazu führen, schon vorzeitig aussortiert zu werden.“ Das Gehalt sei ein wichtiges und sensibles Thema, das erst im direkten Gespräch aufkommen sollte.
3. Mut bei Kontaktanfragen
VW-Recruiter Nollido empfiehlt, sich bei Interesse an einem konkreten Unternehmen mit dem Personaler oder dem einstellenden Fachbereich zu verbinden. „Durch diesen Kontakt erhält man regelmäßig alle wichtigen Informationen über den Fachbereich, Aktivitäten des Unternehmens oder offene Stellen.“
Und auch über ganz direkte Nachfragen freut sich Peter Nollido. „Selbst wenn heute keine vakante Stelle vorhanden ist, weiß ich so trotzdem, dass der Kandidat Interesse hat. Ich habe dann die Möglichkeit, diesen Kandidaten zu speichern.“ Daraus ergebe sich oft die Möglichkeit zu einem weiteren Austausch.
4. Den gegenseitigen Austausch suchen
„Karrierenetzwerke sind nicht nur dafür da, um auf der Karriereleiter den nächsten Schritt zu machen“, sagt Beraterin Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig. Sie dienen der Coachin zufolge auch dazu, sich über verschiedene Themen zu informieren und auszutauschen.
Wer sich etwa zu einer bestimmten Branche oder einem Fachthema informieren möchte, könne sich mit entsprechenden Spezialisten vernetzen. „Ich kann auch schauen, ob ich im Netzwerk jemanden finde, der genau den Job hat, der mich interessiert, und um einen Austausch bitten. Die meisten Menschen sind positiv gestimmt und beantworten gerne Fragen.“
5. Langfristig denken
Wer von einem Karrierenetzwerk profitieren will, sollte frühzeitig damit anfangen, es zu pflegen. „Es ist ganz wichtig, das Netzwerk langfristig aufzubauen. Das unterschätzen viele. Ein Netzwerk muss bereits da sein, wenn ich es brauche“, sagt Herrmann-Hurtzig.
Das funktioniere aber nur, wenn das Netzwerk als Ort des Nehmens und Geben verstanden würde. „Viele Leute denken, sie könnten nichts geben, aber das stimmt oft nicht. Unabhängig vom Lebensalter kann jeder etwas geben, hat jeder Qualifikationen oder Kompetenzen, die das Netzwerk bereichern.“
6. Lesen, speichern, teilen: Auf Netzwerken aktiv bleiben
Der Schlüssel für ein intaktes Netzwerk liegt dabei auch in der eigenen Aktivität. Wer nie Beiträge anschaut, speichert, kommentiert oder teilt, wird nicht wahrgenommen. „Dann geht das System davon aus, dass kein Interesse an einem Jobwechsel besteht und man rutscht in der Suche ganz weit nach unten“, sagt Peter Nollido.
Zu Beginn kann es hilfreich sein, sich andere Profile aus ähnlichen Branchen oder Interessengebieten anzuschauen. „Dann vernetze ich mich mit allen Kontakten, die ich in meiner eigenen Branche brauche. Da sollte man keine Scheu haben“, rät Nollido.
7. Anfragen richtig beurteilen
Vorsicht ist geboten, wenn Anfragen kommen, hinter denen keine offizielle Firma steckt. „Manche Unternehmen sammeln nur Daten und geben diese dann weiter. Da würde ich prüfen, ob es die Firma überhaupt gibt, ob sie eine Webseite hat und so weiter“, sagt Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig.
Ein weiteres Indiz für einen Betrug sind generisch formulierte Nachrichten, die sich nicht auf das eigene Profil beziehen, sagt Peter Nollido.
Ein bisschen Geduld braucht es manchmal, wenn Headhunter eingeschaltet wurden. In diesem Fall ist es nicht unüblich, dass zunächst keine Informationen über die vakante Stelle oder die suchende Firma geteilt werden dürfen. Spätestens im zweiten Kontakt aber sollte die Anfrage deutlich konkreter werden, sagt Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig.

Article: Köln · Die hauchdünnen Streifen des grünen Spargels werden bei Food-Bloggerin Julia Uehren nur blanchiert. So bleiben sie knackig und bilden im Nudelsalat einen schönen Kontrast zu den weichen Linguini.
Die Spargel-Saison ist in vollem Gange. Wer den Geschmack besonders intensiv auskosten möchte, serviert grünen Spargel mit handgemachtem grünem Spargelpesto. Als Nudelsalat macht das Gericht eine hervorragende Figur zum Grillen oder auf dem Buffet.
Der Spargel wird in diesem Rezept in hauchdünne Streifen geschnitten und nur kurz blanchiert. Das sieht nicht nur hübsch aus, sondern sorgt auch dafür, dass sich der Spargel gut mit den Linguine vermengen lässt. Gleichzeitig bildet er aber mit seinem knackigen Biss auch einen schönen Kontrapunkt zu den weichen Nudeln.
Sein besonders Aroma erhält der Nudelsalat zum einen durch das frische Dressing aus Weißweinessig, Olivenöl und Zitrone und zum anderen durch das cremige Pesto aus grünem Spargel, gerösteten Pinienkernen, Parmesan, Knoblauch und Petersilie.
Zutaten für 4 Portionen:
750 g grüner Spargel1 TL Zucker1 TL Salz1 TL Butter300 g Linguine30 g Pinienkerne20 g Parmesan (am Stück)15 g Petersilie1 Bio-Zitrone1 Zehe Knoblauch2 EL Weißweinessig3 EL OlivenölPfeffer
Zubereitung:
1. Spargel gründlich waschen und das untere Drittel schälen. Spargelköpfe und das untere Drittel abschneiden. Die Spargelstangen dann mit einem Sparschäler oder einem scharfen Messer längs in hauchdünne Streifen schneiden.
2. Einen Topf mit ca. 700 ml Wasser mit 1 TL Salz, 1 TL Zucker und 1 TL Butter zum Kochen bringen. Spargel-Enden ins Wasser geben. Ca. 2 Minuten bei mittlerer Temperatur köcheln lassen. Die Spargelköpfe dazugeben noch mal ca. 2 Minuten köcheln lassen. Alles mit einer Schaumkelle aus dem Wasser heben und beiseitestellen. Dann den in Streifen geschnittenen Spargel in das Wasser geben und ca. 1 Minute köcheln lassen. Über einem Sieb abgießen.
3. Linguine laut Packungsanleitung al dente kochen und mit kaltem Wasser abspülen.
4. Pinienkerne in einer Pfanne ohne Öl bei mittlerer Hitze goldbraun rösten. Parmesan fein reiben. Petersilie waschen und trocken schütteln. Zitrone waschen und abtrocknen. Ca. 1 TL von der Schale abreiben, den Saft auspressen. Knoblauch schälen.
5. Die Spargel-Enden, Pinienkerne, Parmesan, Petersilie (samt Stielen), Knoblauch und etwas Wasser mit einem Mixer oder Pürierstab zu einer feinen Creme verarbeiten.
6. In einer großen Schüssel Weißweinessig, Zitronensaft, Zitronenabrieb und Olivenöl vermengen. Spargelpesto unterrühren. Mit Salz und Pfeffer abschmecken.
7. Spargelköpfe längs halbieren und zusammen mit den Spargelstreifen dazugeben. Nudeln unterheben und alles gut vermengen.

Article: Berlin · Fenster, Fassade, Dach: Die energetische Sanierung des Eigenheims kann richtig teuer werden. Wer von Steuervorteilen profitieren möchte, tut aber gut daran, die Maßnahmen nicht in Raten zu begleichen.
Wer seine mindestens zehn Jahre alte, zu eigenen Wohnzwecken genutzte Immobilie einer energetischen Sanierung unterzieht, kann dabei steuerlich profitieren. Die Kosten des ausführenden Fachunternehmens sind zu 20 Prozent absetzbar - bis zu einer Höchstgrenze von 40.000 Euro und verteilt über einen Zeitraum von drei Jahren. Wichtige Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass Steuerzahlerinnen und Steuerzahler parallel keine anderen Fördermittel der KfW oder des Bundesamts für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle (BAFA) in Anspruch nehmen. Und, dass sie den Aufwand nicht in Raten bezahlen. Sonst ist der Bonus unter Umständen verspielt.
Genau das ist Steuerzahlern bereits passiert. Auf ein entsprechendes Urteil des Finanzgerichts München (Az.: 8 K 1534/23) verweist der Bund der Steuerzahler. In dem konkreten Fall hatte ein Paar in seinem Einfamilienhaus eine neue Heizungsanlage einbauen lassen. Preis: rund 8120 Euro. Im Jahr der Fertigstellung bezahlte das Paar aber zunächst nur 2000 Euro, der restliche Betrag sollte in Raten abgestottert werden. Das zuständige Finanzamt versagte dem Paar den Steuerabzug daraufhin. Zurecht, wie das Gericht später feststellte.
Aufwand und Zahlung müssen in einem Jahr zusammenfallen
„Ausgaben werden im Steuerrecht in der Regel nur in dem Jahr berücksichtigt, in dem sie anfallen“, sagt Daniela Karbe-Geßler vom Bund der Steuerzahler. Zum vollständigen Abschluss einer energetischen Maßnahme zählt aber eben nicht nur die Fertigstellung durch die Handwerker. Auch die vollständige Bezahlung der Arbeiten ist dafür notwendige Bedingung.
Wird die Maßnahme im Jahr der Installation nicht vollständig bezahlt, fallen Aufwand und Zahlung nicht zusammen, wodurch die Kosten grundsätzlich nicht absetzbar sind - weder in Teilen noch zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt.
„Deshalb ist es nach aktueller Rechtsprechung wichtig, den Rechnungsbetrag im Jahr der Fertigstellung der Maßnahme komplett und nicht in Raten zu zahlen“, so Karbe-Geßler. Denn selbst wenn alle anderen Voraussetzungen vorbildlich erfüllt sind, also etwa die erforderlichen Bescheinigungen über die Maßnahme vorliegen und die Steuererklärung korrekt ausgefüllt wurde, kann es am Ende genau an der Zahlungsmethode scheitern.

Article: Düsseldorf · Der Termin steht: Ein künstliches Gelenk soll eingesetzt oder ein Tumor entfernt werden, stationär im Krankenhaus. Was muss man vor so einem Klinikaufenthalt regeln, wissen, einpacken?
Die Aussicht auf einen Klinikaufenthalt, die ist wohl für niemanden so richtig schön. Nicht nur, weil sich vorab Ängste melden, ob der Eingriff wie geplant verläuft, ob man die Narkose gut verträgt, wie schnell man wortwörtlich wieder auf die Beine kommt. Die Gedanken kreisen vielleicht auch um Fragen wie: Habe ich an alles gedacht, muss ich noch etwas klären? Hier bekommen Sie einen Überblick:
Was muss ich vorab erledigen?
Der Termin für die Krankenhausbehandlung steht, vielleicht hat man Ihnen schon eine Prognose gegeben, wie viele Nächte Sie dort bleiben müssen. Diese Information sollten Sie weitergeben an alle, die mit Ihrer Abwesenheit planen müssen. Zum Beispiel an den Arbeitgeber, wie Verena Querling, Referentin Pflegerecht bei der Verbraucherzentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen, sagt.
Was sonst noch erledigt werden muss? „Das hängt natürlich von der jeweiligen Lebenssituation ab“, sagt Querling. Vielleicht braucht es jemanden, der die Gemüsebeete im Garten in dieser Zeit gießt, die Katze versorgt, den Briefkasten leert, die Tochter zum Turnunterricht fährt. „Am besten spannt man frühzeitig ein Netz, das dann aushelfen kann.“
Und wer springt ein, wenn man zum Beispiel den Partner oder die Mutter pflegt, das aber wegen des Krankenhausaufenthalts für eine Weile nicht kann? Dann kann die Verhinderungspflege eine Option ein. Das bedeutet: Die Pflegeversicherung trägt für Pflegebedürftige der Grade 2 bis 5 die nachgewiesenen Kosten einer Ersatzpflege. Diese Ersatzpflege kann durch einen ambulanten Pflegedienst, durch Einzelpflegekräfte, ehrenamtlich Pflegende, aber auch durch nahe Angehörige erfolgen, heißt es vom Bundesgesundheitsministerium.
Was braucht das Krankenhaus alles von mir?
Ohne Versichertenkarte und Personalausweis geht bei der Anmeldung nichts. Um im Krankenhaus aufgenommen zu werden, muss zudem eine Einweisung vorliegen („Verordnung von Krankenhausbehandlung“), die von Haus- oder Facharzt ausgestellt wird. Wer privat krankenversichert ist, sollte die Kostenzusage der Krankenkasse parat haben.
Sofern man eine Patientenverfügung oder eine Vorsorgevollmacht hat, ist es sinnvoll, auch diese mitzunehmen, rät Verena Querling. Und natürlich sollte man dafür sorgen, dass das Krankenhaus möglichst gut über den eigenen Gesundheitszustand und Besonderheiten Bescheid weiß. Vor einem geplanten Eingriff wird das im Vorgespräch abgefragt.
„Von einem Herzschrittmacher oder einer Prothese müssen die Ärzte natürlich wissen. Und auch, welche Medikamente man einnimmt“, sagt Querling. Allergiker bringen ihren Allergie-Pass mit, wer Blutverdünner einnimmt, sollte seinen Marcumar-Pass einstecken. Die meisten Krankenhäuser geben auf ihrer Webseite auch eine Checkliste, welche Dokumente genau benötigt werden.
Wichtig ist zudem, dem Krankenhaus die Kontaktdaten der Hausarztpraxis zu geben, damit Kommunikation und Austausch von Befunden reibungslos klappen können.
Was kommt ansonsten in die Tasche?
Wenn Sie vor dem Kleiderschrank stehen und überlegen, was in die Kliniktasche wandern soll, sollten Sie diesem Grundsatz folgen: „Worin man sich wohlfühlt und was bequem ist, Kleidungsstücke, in denen man auch den Gang im Krankenhaus runterlaufen würde“, sagt Verena Querling. Gerade bei frischen OP-Narben sind eher weit geschnittene Kleidungsstücke sinnvoll, da drückt nichts.
Hilfsmittel wie Hörgerät oder Brillen müssen natürlich auch mit. Hier gilt besondere Vorsicht, damit sie nicht verloren gehen, wenn man sie vor dem Eingriff ablegt. „Manchmal werden die einfach in Taschentücher gewickelt und sind dann auf einmal weg“, sagt Querling. Besser: sicher in Dose oder Etui verstauen und vorab klären, wie sie wieder den Weg zu einem finden.
Und natürlich sollte man auch Dinge einpacken, die der Langeweile im Krankenhaus etwas entgegensetzen, „ob es das Sudoku-Heft, ein Headset zum Musikhören oder ein schönes Buch ist“, sagt Querling.
Wer Serien streamen will, sollte sich vorab über die WLAN-Situation im Krankenhaus informieren. Einer Auswertung von Verivox aus dem Mai 2023 zufolge bieten 70 Prozent der größten Kliniken und Krankenhäuser in Deutschland kostenloses WLAN auf den Patientenzimmern an. Wer doch für die Internetnutzung zahlen muss, kann sich auf Kosten von etwa drei bis fünf Euro pro Tag einstellen.
Und was bleibt besser zu Hause? Wertsachen, insbesondere Schmuck. „Man muss Ringe und Co. ja ohnehin ausziehen, wenn es in den OP geht“, sagt Querling.
Was kostet mich der Krankenhausaufenthalt?
Die Zuzahlung liegt für gesetzlich Krankenversicherte ab 18 Jahren bei 10 Euro pro Tag. Wer länger als 28 Tage im Kalenderjahr stationär im Krankenhaus behandelt wird, muss ab dem 29. Tag nichts mehr zuzahlen.
Die Krankenhäuser rechnen dabei direkt mit den Patientinnen und Patienten ab, nach der Entlassung landet also eine Rechnung im Briefkasten.
Apropos Entlassung: Was muss ich dafür alles regeln?
Spätestens, wenn sich das Ende des Klinikaufenthalts abzeichnet, kommt das sogenannte Entlassmanagement des Krankenhauses ins Spiel, das meist beim sozialen Dienst liegt. Dessen Ziel ist es, den Übergang zwischen Krankenhausaufenthalt und der Zeit danach möglichst reibungslos zu gestalten.
Je frühzeitiger man Kontakt zum Entlassmanagement aufnimmt, desto besser - gerade dann, wenn man auch über die Klinikzeit hinaus Unterstützung benötigt, rät Verena Querling. Das Entlassmanagement unterstützt bei Anträgen, zum Beispiel auf einen Pflegegrad. Auch Leistungen wie häusliche Krankenpflege, eine Haushaltshilfe oder Pflegehilfsmittel wie Rollstuhl, Pflegebett oder Toilettenstuhl können aus dem Krankenhaus beantragt und organisiert werden. Und wenn man nach dem Krankenhausaufenthalt noch nicht fit genug für zu Hause ist, kann eine Kurzzeitpflege gesucht werden.
Was muss ich wissen, wenn ich mich selbst entlassen möchte?
„Dann gibt es ein Formular, auf dem man noch einmal darauf hingewiesen wird, dass die Entlassung gegen ärztlichen Rat ist“, sagt Verena Querling. Das muss man unterschreiben, wenn man sich selbst entlassen möchte. Dabei geht es um Haftungsfragen. Bleiben durch das vorzeitige Verlassen des Krankenhauses langfristige Schäden zurück, wird es schwierig, diese vor Gericht als ärztlichen Behandlungsfehler anerkennen zu lassen.
Das heißt aber nicht, dass man abgewiesen wird, wenn man doch wieder ärztliche Behandlung benötigt. „Sollte zum Beispiel eine OP-Wunde doch wieder aufgehen, wird man natürlich wieder behandelt“, sagt Verena Querling.
Kann das Krankenhaus mich krankschreiben?
Ja, das ist möglich, für bis zu sieben Tage. „Das verschafft einem ein bisschen Luft, sodass man nicht sofort zum Hausarzt muss, wenn man aus dem Krankenhaus kommt“, sagt Verena Querling.
Gut möglich, dass man sich aber doch zeitnah auf den Weg zur Arztpraxis machen muss, nämlich dann, wenn man Medikamente benötigt. Denn Krankenhäuser dürfen sie nur begrenzt mitgeben bzw. verordnen.
Wird man vor oder an einem Wochenende oder Feiertag entlassen, darf das Krankenhaus nur so viele Medikamente mitgeben, wie es zur Überbrückung dieser Tage braucht. Die Klinik kann Medikamente aber auch verordnen, sodass man sie nach der Entlassung selbst in der Apotheke abholen kann. Möglich ist dabei allerdings höchstens die kleinste Packungsgröße.

Article: Frankfurt/Main/Düsseldorf · Eine Operation am Herzen ist kein kleiner Eingriff. Wer bei einer planbaren OP unsicher ist, kann sich eine zweite Meinung einholen. Wann ist sie sinnvoll und an wen kann ich mich wenden?
Klar ist: Eine Zweitmeinung kommt nur dann in Betracht, wenn keine Zeitnot besteht. Darauf weist Professor Thomas Meinertz vom Wissenschaftlichen Beirat der Deutschen Herzstiftung hin. Bei einem Herzinfarkt etwa ist schnelles Handeln gefragt.
Aber vor allem das Wie mancher Behandlung kann durchaus abgewogen werden. Ist ein chirurgischer Eingriff nötig, ist eine OP per Herzkatheter möglich oder reichen vielleicht sogar Medikamente - unterschiedliche Ärzte können das jeweils anders beurteilen.
Besonderes Verfahren für bestimmte OPs
Für bestimmte Operationen gibt es ein spezielles Zweitmeinungsverfahren. Beim Herzen ist das etwa das Einsetzen eines Schrittmachers oder eine Verödung am Herzen. In so einem Fall müssen behandelnder Arzt oder Ärztin sogar mindestens zehn Tage vor der Operation darauf hinweisen, dass eine Beratung bei einem entsprechend qualifizierten Arzt möglich ist. Das erklärt die Verbraucherzentrale NRW auf ihrer Webseite.
Diese Beratung kann man dann annehmen oder nicht. Die entsprechenden Zweitexperten müssen besonders qualifiziert und unabhängig sein und brauchen eine Genehmigung der Kassenärztlichen Vereinigung. Eine Auflistung findet sich auf der Website des ärztlichen Bereitschaftsdienstes.
Selbstständig um Zweitmeinung kümmern
Aber auch bei anderen geplanten Herz-OPs kann eine Zweitmeinung sinnvoll sein, sagt Professor Meinertz. Etwa bei einem Herzklappenersatz oder einer Bypass-Operation. Jeder Patient und jede Patientin hat das Recht, sich diese einzuholen. Aber wo? Sich selbst im Internet umzusehen, hält der Herzexperte wegen zu positiver Selbstdarstellungen für problematisch. Besser erkundige man sich der entsprechenden Krankenkasse oder Ärztekammer.
Auch der behandelnde Arzt oder die Ärztin kann jemanden empfehlen. Denn im Idealfall ist er offen für eine weitere Einschätzung. Ein No-Go sei allerdings, sagt Meinertz, dass einfach ein befreundeter Kollege angerufen werde, der voreingenommen nur die Erstmeinung bestätigen solle. Vielmehr sollte der nach einer zweiten Meinung Gefragte nicht von vornherein auf eine bestimmte Methode festgelegt sein.
Was Patienten und Patientinnen jedoch vermeiden sollten: Noch eine Dritt- oder gar Viertmeinung einzuholen. Das verunsichert laut dem Herzspezialisten am Ende nur.

Article: New York · Polizeieinsätze, Festnahmen und ein besetztes Gebäude: An US-Universitäten spitzt sich die Lage um propalästinensische Proteste zu.
Propalästinensischen Demonstrierenden droht nach der Besetzung eines Gebäudes der New Yorker Elite-Universität Columbia der Rausschmiss. Man habe sehr deutlich gemacht, „dass die Arbeit der Universität nicht endlos durch Demonstranten gestört werden kann, die gegen die Regeln verstoßen. Wenn dies weiterhin geschieht, wird dies klare Konsequenzen nach sich ziehen“, hieß es in einer Stellungnahme der Hochschule.
Den Dutzenden Studierenden, die die Hamilton Hall besetzt hielten, drohe der Ausschluss. Auch das Weiße Haus übte deutliche Kritik am Vorgehen der Demonstrantinnen und Demonstranten, die gegen Israels Vorgehen im Gaza-Krieg und die Unterstützung des jüdischen Staates durch die US-Regierung protestieren.
Die seit knapp zwei Wochen andauernden Proteste an der Universität in der liberalen Ostküstenmetropole New York waren eskaliert. Demonstrierende drangen in die Hamilton Hall auf dem Campus im Norden Manhattans ein, die schon 1968 während eines Protests gegen den Vietnam-Krieg besetzt worden war.
Protestwelle im ganzen Land
Auch andere Universitäten sind längst von der Protestwelle erfasst worden. Laut US-Medien wurden seit Beginn der Unmutsbekundungen im ganzen Land mehr als 1000 Demonstranten vorläufig festgenommen - gestern griff die Polizei unter anderem in den Bundesstaaten Kalifornien, Georgia und North Carolina ein.
Am Montag hatte die Columbia-Universität angekündigt, Studentinnen und Studenten zu suspendieren, sollten sie ein Protestcamp auf dem Universitätsgelände nicht bis zum Nachmittag verlassen. Doch das Gegenteil geschah: Auf Videos vom Campus war zu sehen, wie Vermummte mit schwarz-weißen Palästinensertüchern Fenster einschlagen und den Eingang der Hamilton Hall mit Stühlen und Tischen verbarrikadieren. Nach Angaben der Studierendenzeitung „Columbia Spectator“ drangen mehrere Dutzend Protestierende in das Gebäude ein, während Hunderte weitere davor demonstrierten.
Die Studierendengruppen „Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine“ und „Columbia University Apartheid Divest“ kündigten an, die Hamilton Hall nicht zu verlassen, bis ihre Forderungen erfüllt würden. „Ein Gebäude zu besetzen, ist ein geringes Risiko im Vergleich zum täglichen Widerstand der Palästinenser im Gazastreifen“, hieß es in einer auf der Plattform X, früher Twitter, verbreiteten Stellungnahme. Die Demonstrierenden kritisieren das Vorgehen Israels im Gaza-Krieg und fordern Solidarität mit den Palästinensern. Außerdem verlangen sie von der Hochschule, finanzielle Beziehungen mit Israel zu kappen. Die Universität lehnte das bisher ab.
UN-Generalsekretär: Freie Meinungsäußerung muss möglich sein
Auch die US-Regierung reagierte auf die Besetzung während der Nacht: „Die gewaltsame Übernahme eines Gebäudes auf dem Campus ist der absolut falsche Weg. Das ist kein Beispiel für friedlichen Protest“, sagte der Kommunikationsdirektor des Nationalen Sicherheitsrats, John Kirby. Ein kleiner Prozentsatz von Studierenden sollte nicht in der Lage sein, die akademische Ausbildung aller zu stören. „Studenten, die für ihren Universitätsbesuch bezahlen und eine Ausbildung anstreben, sollten dieser ungestört folgen können, und sie sollten sich dabei sicher fühlen können“, sagte Kirby. Hassrede und Symbole des Hasses hätten in den USA keinen Platz.
UN-Generalsekretär António Guterres wandte sich ebenfalls gegen Hassrede, betonte aber auch, dass freie Meinungsäußerung möglich sein müsse. Die Universitäten sollten ihre Weisheit nutzen, um angemessen mit der Situation umzugehen.
Kritik an New Yorker Polizei
Vor knapp zwei Wochen hatte ein Einsatz der New Yorker Polizei an der Columbia-Universität für Aufsehen und Kritik gesorgt, in der Folge kam es an Dutzenden Universitäten in den USA zu Protesten und der Errichtung von Zeltlagern. Einigen Demonstrierenden wird Antisemitismus und die Verharmlosung der islamistischen Hamas vorgeworfen, deren Ziel die Vernichtung des Staates Israel ist.
Israels Präsident Izchak Herzog nannte die „entsetzlichen antisemitischen Aktionen“ an der Universität Columbia zutiefst beunruhigend. „Die amerikanische Wissenschaft muss sich der Bedrohung bewusst werden“, schrieb Herzog auf der Plattform X. Er sprach von „einer klaren und gegenwärtigen Gefahr für die akademische Freiheit und für das Leben der Juden auf dem Campus“. Herzog forderte, antisemitische Aktionen auf dem Campus zu unterbinden.
Die Hamas und andere islamistische Gruppen hatten bei ihrem Überfall auf Israel am 7. Oktober vergangenen Jahres etwa 1200 Menschen getötet und mehr als 250 als Geiseln in den Gazastreifen verschleppt. Israel reagierte darauf mit einer Bodenoffensive und Luftangriffen auf das Küstengebiet. In der Folge wurden nach - unabhängig kaum zu verifizierenden - Angaben der von der Hamas kontrollierten Gesundheitsbehörde seit Kriegsbeginn etwa 34 500 Menschen getötet.

Article: München · Thomas Tuchel richtet den Blick nach dem 2:2 in der ersten Halbfinal-Runde gegen Real sofort nach vorne. Man fahre jetzt nach Madrid - „and the winner takes it all“. Wembley bleibt das Bayern-Ziel.
Bayern-Trainer Thomas Tuchel richtete den Blick nach dem am Ende ärgerlichen 2:2 in der ersten Halbfinal-Begegnung gegen Real Madrid ganz schnell auf das entscheidende Champions-League-Rückspiel in Spanien.
„Es lohnt sich nicht, lange mit dem Ergebnis zu hadern. Die Ausgangslage ist ganz klar. Wir fahren nach Madrid - and the winner takes it all“, sagte Tuchel in der Allianz Arena. Der Sieger am Mittwoch kommender Woche wird dann ins Endspiel am 1. Juni im Londoner Wembleystadion einziehen.
Die Bayern hatten die Partie in der Allianz Arena nach dem 0:1-Pausenstand durch Tore von Leroy Sané und Harry Kane gedreht. Aber in der Schlussphase schlug Real durch einen Elfmeter des zweifachen Torschützen Vinicius Junior zurück. „Real hat das schon mit anderen Teams gemacht“, bemerkte Tuchel zu Reals Effektivität. „Wir haben die erste Hälfte verloren und die zweite gewonnen“, sagte Tuchel: „Es ist immer noch ein Fifty-fifty-Spiel.“
Ähnlich äußerte sich Real-Coach Carlo Ancelotti: „Es ist noch nichts entschieden.“ Angesichts des Heimvorteils im Halbfinal-Rückspiel wertete der ehemalige Bayern-Coach das Ergebnis allerdings als „gut fürs Rückspiel“.
„Das Bernabeu ist einer der schwersten Orte“
Tuchel weiß, dass es eine große Leistung seiner Bayern braucht, um mit dem Finaleinzug in der Königsklasse die letzte Titelchance der Saison zu erhalten. „Das Bernabeu-Stadion ist einer der schwersten Orte, zu gewinnen“, sagte der 50-Jährige. „Wir haben 90 Minuten, 120 Minuten, vielleicht ein Elfmeterschießen. Das Ziel ist klar, wir müssen gewinnen.“

Die Spargel-Saison ist in vollem Gange. Wer den Geschmack besonders intensiv auskosten möchte, serviert grünen Spargel mit handgemachtem grünem Spargelpesto. Als Nudelsalat macht das Gericht eine hervorragende Figur zum Grillen oder auf dem Buffet.
Der Spargel wird in diesem Rezept in hauchdünne Streifen geschnitten und nur kurz blanchiert. Das sieht nicht nur hübsch aus, sondern sorgt auch dafür, dass sich der Spargel gut mit den Linguine vermengen lässt. Gleichzeitig bildet er aber mit seinem knackigen Biss auch einen schönen Kontrapunkt zu den weichen Nudeln.
Sein besonders Aroma erhält der Nudelsalat zum einen durch das frische Dressing aus Weißweinessig, Olivenöl und Zitrone und zum anderen durch das cremige Pesto aus grünem Spargel, gerösteten Pinienkernen, Parmesan, Knoblauch und Petersilie.
Zutaten für 4 Portionen:
750 g grüner Spargel
1 TL Zucker
1 TL Salz
1 TL Butter
300 g Linguine
30 g Pinienkerne
20 g Parmesan (am Stück)
15 g Petersilie
1 Bio-Zitrone
1 Zehe Knoblauch
2 EL Weißweinessig
3 EL Olivenöl
Pfeffer
Zubereitung:
1. Spargel gründlich waschen und das untere Drittel schälen. Spargelköpfe und das untere Drittel abschneiden. Die Spargelstangen dann mit einem Sparschäler oder einem scharfen Messer längs in hauchdünne Streifen schneiden.
2. Einen Topf mit ca. 700 ml Wasser mit 1 TL Salz, 1 TL Zucker und 1 TL Butter zum Kochen bringen. Spargel-Enden ins Wasser geben. Ca. 2 Minuten bei mittlerer Temperatur köcheln lassen. Die Spargelköpfe dazugeben noch mal ca. 2 Minuten köcheln lassen. Alles mit einer Schaumkelle aus dem Wasser heben und beiseitestellen. Dann den in Streifen geschnittenen Spargel in das Wasser geben und ca. 1 Minute köcheln lassen. Über einem Sieb abgießen.
3. Linguine laut Packungsanleitung al dente kochen und mit kaltem Wasser abspülen.
4. Pinienkerne in einer Pfanne ohne Öl bei mittlerer Hitze goldbraun rösten. Parmesan fein reiben. Petersilie waschen und trocken schütteln. Zitrone waschen und abtrocknen. Ca. 1 TL von der Schale abreiben, den Saft auspressen. Knoblauch schälen.
5. Die Spargel-Enden, Pinienkerne, Parmesan, Petersilie (samt Stielen), Knoblauch und etwas Wasser mit einem Mixer oder Pürierstab zu einer feinen Creme verarbeiten.
6. In einer großen Schüssel Weißweinessig, Zitronensaft, Zitronenabrieb und Olivenöl vermengen. Spargelpesto unterrühren. Mit Salz und Pfeffer abschmecken.
7. Spargelköpfe längs halbieren und zusammen mit den Spargelstreifen dazugeben. Nudeln unterheben und alles gut vermengen.

Article: Ratenzahlung für energetische Maßnahmen ist nicht ratsam
Fenster, Fassade, Dach: Die energetische Sanierung des Eigenheims kann richtig teuer werden. Wer von Steuervorteilen profitieren möchte, tut aber gut daran, die Maßnahmen nicht in Raten zu begleichen.
Wer seine mindestens zehn Jahre alte, zu eigenen Wohnzwecken genutzte Immobilie einer energetischen Sanierung unterzieht, kann dabei steuerlich profitieren. Die Kosten des ausführenden Fachunternehmens sind zu 20 Prozent absetzbar - bis zu einer Höchstgrenze von 40.000 Euro und verteilt über einen Zeitraum von drei Jahren. Wichtige Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass Steuerzahlerinnen und Steuerzahler parallel keine anderen Fördermittel der KfW oder des Bundesamts für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle (BAFA) in Anspruch nehmen. Und, dass sie den Aufwand nicht in Raten bezahlen. Sonst ist der Bonus unter Umständen verspielt.
Genau das ist Steuerzahlern bereits passiert. Auf ein entsprechendes Urteil des Finanzgerichts München (Az.: 8 K 1534/23) verweist der Bund der Steuerzahler. In dem konkreten Fall hatte ein Paar in seinem Einfamilienhaus eine neue Heizungsanlage einbauen lassen. Preis: rund 8120 Euro. Im Jahr der Fertigstellung bezahlte das Paar aber zunächst nur 2000 Euro, der restliche Betrag sollte in Raten abgestottert werden. Das zuständige Finanzamt versagte dem Paar den Steuerabzug daraufhin. Zurecht, wie das Gericht später feststellte.
Aufwand und Zahlung müssen in einem Jahr zusammenfallen
"Ausgaben werden im Steuerrecht in der Regel nur in dem Jahr berücksichtigt, in dem sie anfallen", sagt Daniela Karbe-Geßler vom Bund der Steuerzahler. Zum vollständigen Abschluss einer energetischen Maßnahme zählt aber eben nicht nur die Fertigstellung durch die Handwerker. Auch die vollständige Bezahlung der Arbeiten ist dafür notwendige Bedingung.
Wird die Maßnahme im Jahr der Installation nicht vollständig bezahlt, fallen Aufwand und Zahlung nicht zusammen, wodurch die Kosten grundsätzlich nicht absetzbar sind - weder in Teilen noch zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt.
"Deshalb ist es nach aktueller Rechtsprechung wichtig, den Rechnungsbetrag im Jahr der Fertigstellung der Maßnahme komplett und nicht in Raten zu zahlen", so Karbe-Geßler. Denn selbst wenn alle anderen Voraussetzungen vorbildlich erfüllt sind, also etwa die erforderlichen Bescheinigungen über die Maßnahme vorliegen und die Steuererklärung korrekt ausgefüllt wurde, kann es am Ende genau an der Zahlungsmethode scheitern.

Article: Columbia-Universität droht wegen Protesten mit Rauswurf
Polizeieinsätze, Festnahmen und ein besetztes Gebäude: An US-Universitäten spitzt sich die Lage um propalästinensische Proteste zu.
Propalästinensischen Demonstrierenden droht nach der Besetzung eines Gebäudes der New Yorker Elite-Universität Columbia der Rausschmiss. Man habe sehr deutlich gemacht, "dass die Arbeit der Universität nicht endlos durch Demonstranten gestört werden kann, die gegen die Regeln verstoßen. Wenn dies weiterhin geschieht, wird dies klare Konsequenzen nach sich ziehen", hieß es in einer Stellungnahme der Hochschule.
Den Dutzenden Studierenden, die die Hamilton Hall besetzt hielten, drohe der Ausschluss. Auch das Weiße Haus übte deutliche Kritik am Vorgehen der Demonstrantinnen und Demonstranten, die gegen Israels Vorgehen im Gaza-Krieg und die Unterstützung des jüdischen Staates durch die US-Regierung protestieren.
Die seit knapp zwei Wochen andauernden Proteste an der Universität in der liberalen Ostküstenmetropole New York waren eskaliert. Demonstrierende drangen in die Hamilton Hall auf dem Campus im Norden Manhattans ein, die schon 1968 während eines Protests gegen den Vietnam-Krieg besetzt worden war.
Protestwelle im ganzen Land
Auch andere Universitäten sind längst von der Protestwelle erfasst worden. Laut US-Medien wurden seit Beginn der Unmutsbekundungen im ganzen Land mehr als 1000 Demonstranten vorläufig festgenommen - gestern griff die Polizei unter anderem in den Bundesstaaten Kalifornien, Georgia und North Carolina ein.
Am Montag hatte die Columbia-Universität angekündigt, Studentinnen und Studenten zu suspendieren, sollten sie ein Protestcamp auf dem Universitätsgelände nicht bis zum Nachmittag verlassen. Doch das Gegenteil geschah: Auf Videos vom Campus war zu sehen, wie Vermummte mit schwarz-weißen Palästinensertüchern Fenster einschlagen und den Eingang der Hamilton Hall mit Stühlen und Tischen verbarrikadieren. Nach Angaben der Studierendenzeitung "Columbia Spectator" drangen mehrere Dutzend Protestierende in das Gebäude ein, während Hunderte weitere davor demonstrierten.
Die Studierendengruppen "Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine" und "Columbia University Apartheid Divest" kündigten an, die Hamilton Hall nicht zu verlassen, bis ihre Forderungen erfüllt würden. "Ein Gebäude zu besetzen, ist ein geringes Risiko im Vergleich zum täglichen Widerstand der Palästinenser im Gazastreifen", hieß es in einer auf der Plattform X, früher Twitter, verbreiteten Stellungnahme. Die Demonstrierenden kritisieren das Vorgehen Israels im Gaza-Krieg und fordern Solidarität mit den Palästinensern. Außerdem verlangen sie von der Hochschule, finanzielle Beziehungen mit Israel zu kappen. Die Universität lehnte das bisher ab.
UN-Generalsekretär: Freie Meinungsäußerung muss möglich sein
Auch die US-Regierung reagierte auf die Besetzung während der Nacht: "Die gewaltsame Übernahme eines Gebäudes auf dem Campus ist der absolut falsche Weg. Das ist kein Beispiel für friedlichen Protest", sagte der Kommunikationsdirektor des Nationalen Sicherheitsrats, John Kirby. Ein kleiner Prozentsatz von Studierenden sollte nicht in der Lage sein, die akademische Ausbildung aller zu stören. "Studenten, die für ihren Universitätsbesuch bezahlen und eine Ausbildung anstreben, sollten dieser ungestört folgen können, und sie sollten sich dabei sicher fühlen können", sagte Kirby. Hassrede und Symbole des Hasses hätten in den USA keinen Platz.
UN-Generalsekretär António Guterres wandte sich ebenfalls gegen Hassrede, betonte aber auch, dass freie Meinungsäußerung möglich sein müsse. Die Universitäten sollten ihre Weisheit nutzen, um angemessen mit der Situation umzugehen.
Kritik an New Yorker Polizei
Vor knapp zwei Wochen hatte ein Einsatz der New Yorker Polizei an der Columbia-Universität für Aufsehen und Kritik gesorgt, in der Folge kam es an Dutzenden Universitäten in den USA zu Protesten und der Errichtung von Zeltlagern. Einigen Demonstrierenden wird Antisemitismus und die Verharmlosung der islamistischen Hamas vorgeworfen, deren Ziel die Vernichtung des Staates Israel ist.
Israels Präsident Izchak Herzog nannte die "entsetzlichen antisemitischen Aktionen" an der Universität Columbia zutiefst beunruhigend. "Die amerikanische Wissenschaft muss sich der Bedrohung bewusst werden", schrieb Herzog auf der Plattform X. Er sprach von "einer klaren und gegenwärtigen Gefahr für die akademische Freiheit und für das Leben der Juden auf dem Campus". Herzog forderte, antisemitische Aktionen auf dem Campus zu unterbinden.
Die Hamas und andere islamistische Gruppen hatten bei ihrem Überfall auf Israel am 7. Oktober vergangenen Jahres etwa 1200 Menschen getötet und mehr als 250 als Geiseln in den Gazastreifen verschleppt. Israel reagierte darauf mit einer Bodenoffensive und Luftangriffen auf das Küstengebiet. In der Folge wurden nach - unabhängig kaum zu verifizierenden - Angaben der von der Hamas kontrollierten Gesundheitsbehörde seit Kriegsbeginn etwa 34 500 Menschen getötet.

Article: Chris Hemsworth hat erneut über seine Rolle bei der schlechten Aufnahme nachgedacht Thor: Liebe und Donnerund trägt die Schuld dafür, dass er sich zu sehr auf die extreme Albernheit des Films einlässt.
In einer neuen Titelgeschichte mit Vanity FairHemsworth erklärte: „Ich verfiel in die Improvisation und die Verrücktheit und wurde zu einer Parodie auf mich selbst.“ Ich habe die Landung nicht geschafft.“
Der Star der Thor Franchise sprach zuvor mit über den vierten Teil GQ Letztes Jahr brachte er seine Befürchtungen zum Ausdruck, dass der Film „zu albern“ gewesen sein könnte, was ihn dazu veranlasste, „eine Weile andere Dinge zu tun“.
Im Interview mit Vanity FairEs ist klar, dass sich Hemsworths Gefühle zu diesem Thema seitdem nur noch gefestigt haben – aber er ist hin- und hergerissen zwischen seinem Wunsch, von Regisseuren wie Greta Gerwig und Steven Spielberg „ernst genommen“ zu werden, und der Überzeugung, dass „er dem Publikum etwas anderes schuldet“. Thor nach einem gefühlten Hauch.“
Im gesamten Profil betonte Hemsworth auch, wie dankbar er für die lebensverändernde Gelegenheit ist, die Rolle des Thor als damals 25-jährigen unbekannten Schauspieler angeboten zu bekommen.
Vanity Fair habe mich auch an ihn gewandt Thor: Ragnarok Co-Star Cate Blanchett, die am Set den Wert seiner unbeschwerten Energie bestätigte. „Ich hatte keine Ahnung, was für ein Idiot er ist. Er ist ein kompletter Idiot“, teilte sie mit. „Er gibt am Set den Ton an – jeder wird geschätzt. Jeder ist willkommen. Ich verehre und bewundere ihn zutiefst.“
Langjähriger Marvel-Co-Star und Ironman Schauspieler Robert Downey Jr. lieferte ebenfalls eine positive Perspektive und erzählte Vanity Fair„Thor als Charakter war sehr schwierig anzupassen – viele implizite Einschränkungen –, aber er und Ken Branagh haben herausgefunden, wie man darüber hinausgeht und ihn irgendwie sympathisch, aber gottähnlich macht.“
Er fuhr fort: „Hemsworth ist meiner Meinung nach der komplexeste Psyche von uns allen Avengers.“ Er hat Witz und Ernsthaftigkeit, aber auch Zurückhaltung, Feuer und Sanftmut.“
Thor: Liebe und Donner Das Drehbuch und die Regie übernahm Oscar-Gewinnerin Taika Waititi, die auch Regie führte Thor: Ragnarok, hat aber das Drehbuch nicht geschrieben. Während Thor: Ragnarok als dringend benötigter frischer Wind für die Figur aufgenommen wurde, hatten viele Zuschauer das Gefühl, dass der nächste Eintrag die Momente der Unbeschwertheit zu sehr betonte.
Während Hemsworth immer noch die Schuld auf sich nahm, gab er auch zu, dass es für ihn nervig wurde, so lange eine Figur zu spielen. „Du lebst sozusagen nur mit Dampf, und dann tauchst du vor etwas auf, das wenig im Tank hat, und du fängst an, die Dinge auseinanderzunehmen: Warum mache ich diesen Film?“ Warum ist dieses Skript nicht besser?“
Im Bereich der „anderen Dinge“, auf die Hemsworth neugierig war, blieb er ausgebucht und beschäftigt. Als nächstes wird er in erscheinen Furiosa: Eine Mad-Max-Saga gegenüber Anya Taylor-Joy, und hat es auch getan Transformers One für September in Sicht.

Article: Einen wunderschönen guten Morgen! Kaum hatte ich in dieser Zeitung den krassen Fehlstart von Grêmio Porto Alegre in Brasileirão und Copa Libertadores thematisiert, schon zuckte der vermeintlich im Sterben liegende Klub auch schon wieder. Erst folgten zwei Heimsiege gegen Paranaense und Cuiaba – gut, letztere verteidigen punkt- und torlos auch eisern die Rote Laterne der Meisterschaft der Brasucas. Dann überraschte der Tricolor Gaúcho in der Copa Libertadores die Argentinier von Estudiantes auswärts in La Plata, wo das vom Henker des HSV, Renato Portaluppi, dirigierte Team in Unterzahl mit 0:1 vom Platz ging. Die ersten Punkte für Grêmio, doch daheim in der Arena do Grêmio, dürfen Estudantes und The Strongest aus La Paz noch schaulaufen. Die Achtelfinals der Libertadores sind wieder in Reichweite. Eingeweiht wurde die Arena übrigens vor zwölf Jahren mit einem Match gegen den HSV, als Hommage an das Weltpokalfinale, das beide Klubs 1983 in Tokio bestritten.
Am Wochenende gab Grêmio mir wieder Recht und war bei Bahia in San Salvador unterlegen (0:1). Der ehemalige Atlético-Madrid-Star Diego Costa erhielt auf der Bank die rote Fleppe, längst ausgewechselt – seinen Zenit hat er übrigens überschritten, schon bei Chelsea faulte er langsam an. Solche Fälle erinnern mich immer an Claudio Paul Caniggia bei der Asien-WM 2002, der damals den Schiri beleidigt hatte. Er spielte bei der schlechtesten WM der Argentinier aller Zeiten keine Minute. Keine Ahnung, warum Marcelo Bielsa ihn überhaupt mitgenommen hatte, vielleicht als Maskottchen.
Den Brasileirão führt nach dem 2:0 im Maracanã gegen das von Adenor Bacchi (Tite) gecoachte Flamengo der Lokalrivale Botafogo an, gefolgt von dem von Ex-Barça Gabriel Milito trainierten Atlético Mineiro (3:0 bei Cuiaba) und dem Brauseklub Bragantino (1:1 bei Fortaleza) aus São Paulo. Vasco da Gama aus Rio de Janeiro verlor zu Hause erdrutschartig mit 0:4 gegen den Criciúma EC aus dem Bundesstaat Santa Catarina – die dritte Niederlage in Folge, das war zu viel, der argentinische Trainer Ramón Díaz, der im Juli vergangenen Jahres anheuerte und den Cariocas noch die Klasse gesichert hatte, musste gehen. Díaz war 1979 in Japan der Torschützenkönig der zweiten U20-WM (damals noch U19), die Argentinien überragend im Finale gegen den Titelverteidiger Sowjetunion mit 3:1 gewann. Seitdem waren Maradona und Ramón Díaz Todfeinde, niemand stiehlt Diego ungestraft die Show. Der Rauswurf von Díaz wurde vom Klub bereits Minuten nach Abpfiff auf X (ehemals Twitter) verbreitet, war also vermutlich schon vor dem Match beschlossen. Als Interimstrainer wurde Rafael Paiva bestimmt, der bislang das U20-Team des Klubs betreute. Das Spiel endete mit Schmähchören.
Vasco liegt aktuell auf einem Abstiegsplatz, nur einen Punkt davor stehen Klub-Vizeweltmeister Fluminense, der siebenfache Meister Corinthians, Herzensklub von Staatspräsident Lula da Silva, und Pokalgewinner FC São Paulo. Auch Titelverteidiger SE Palmeiras hängt noch in den Seilen. Die südamerikanischen Ligen sind deutlich kompetitiver als die europäischen und also ausgeglichener, beinahe immer kann jeder jeden schlagen.

Article: Istanbul. Die türkischen Behörden sperren das Zentrum der Millionenmetropole Istanbul zum 1. Mai weiträumig ab. Zudem erließen sie ein Demonstrationsverbot für den zentralen Taksim-Platz. Wichtige Verbindungsstraßen um das Zentrum herum werden ab dem frühen Mittwoch morgen für den Verkehr gesperrt, wie das Gouverneursamt am Dienstag mitteilte. Zudem werde der U-Bahn-Verkehr rund um den Taksim-Platz eingestellt. Der Fährverkehr durch den Bosporus, der den europäischen und asiatischen Kontinent verbindet, werde stark eingeschränkt. Bereits am Montag hatten die Behörden ein Demonstrationsverbot für den Taksim-Platz erlassen. Stattdessen genehmigten sie Versammlungen nur außerhalb des Stadtzentrums. Innenminister Ali Yerlikaya sagte, der Platz sei für Versammlungen »nicht geeignet«. Er begründete dies unter anderem mit Sicherheitsbedenken. Rund 42.000 Polizisten sollen demnach alleine in Istanbul im Einsatz sein. Gewerkschaften und Opposition fordern dagegen, sich auf dem Taksim-Platz versammeln zu dürfen. Den Gewerkschaftlern wird lediglich erlaubt, einen Kranz niederzulegen. Für Gewerkschaften hat der Platz eine besondere Bedeutung. Am 1. Mai 1977 hatten dort Heckenschützen auf eine Demonstration mit rund 500.000 Teilnehmern geschossen und zahlreiche Menschen getötet. (dpa/jW)

Article: Tel Aviv. Die angekündigte Offensive Israels in Rafah im Süden des Gazastreifens soll nach Angaben des Ministerpräsidenten Benjamin Netanjahu mit oder ohne »Geisel-Deal« mit der Hamas stattfinden. Bei einem Treffen mit Angehörigen israelischer Geiseln und gefallener Soldaten sagte Netanjahu am Dienstag nach Angaben seines Büros: »Wir werden nach Rafah hineingehen und die Bataillone der Hamas dort zerschlagen - mit Deal oder ohne Deal.« Der Regierungschef sagte demnach weiter : »Die Idee, dass wir den Krieg stoppen, bevor alle seine Ziele erreicht sind, kommt nicht in Frage.« Ziel sei weiter der »totale Sieg« über die Hamas. Seine Gesprächspartner hätten ihn dazu aufgerufen, die Kriegsziele zu erreichen und internationalem Druck standzuhalten. In Kairo laufen gegenwärtig indirekte Verhandlungen über eine Feuerpause im Gaza-Krieg und die Freilassung weiterer von der Hamas festgehaltener Israelis im Gegenzug für palästinensische Gefangene in israelischer Hand. Unterstellt wurde dabei bislang, dass Israel im Fall einer Einigung zunächst von einem Militäreinsatz in Rafah absehen würde. (dpa/jW)

Article: Genf. Die Nerven der Menschen in der Grenzstadt Rafah sind laut UNRWA-Chef Philippe Lazzarini aus Angst vor einem Angriff der israelischen Armee bis aufs Äußerste gespannt. Bis Dienstag habe das israelische Militär die Menschen dort noch nicht aufgefordert, das Gebiet, in das viele Palästinenser aus anderen Orten des Gazastreifens geflüchtet sind, zu verlassen, aber damit werde jeden Moment gerechnet, sagte der Chef des UN-Palästinenserhilfswerks am Dienstag in Genf. Vieles hänge nun von den laufenden Verhandlungen über eine Feuerpause und Freilassung von Geiseln ab. »Unsere Kollegen vor Ort berichten von außerordentlicher, tief sitzender Angst«, sagte Lazzarini. Im Norden des Gazastreifens kämen entgegen israelischen Angaben noch immer nicht genügend Lebensmittel an, sagte er. Israelische Stellen verweigerten Konvois des UNRWA mit Hilfsgütern systematisch die Genehmigung, in den Norden zu fahren.
Lazzarini berichtete, dass die meisten der 16 Länder, die Zahlungen an UNRWA gestoppt hatten, blockiertes Geld wieder freigegeben hätten. Dies ging zurück auf Vorwürfe, dass UNRWA-Mitarbeiter an den palästinensischen Massakern des 7. Oktober in Israel beteiligt waren. Eine UN-Untersuchung kam zu dem Schluss, dass das Hilfswerk seine Neutralität im Großen und Ganzen gut wahrt, aber Verbesserungen nötig sind. Unter den Ländern, die noch nicht wieder zahlen, seien die USA, Großbritannien und Österreich, sagte Lazzarini. Insgesamt seien noch 267 Millionen Dollar blockiert. Dem Hilfswerk sei es in den vergangenen sechs Monaten gelungen, 115 Millionen Dollar an privaten Spenden einzunehmen. (dpa/jW)

Article: Der Internationale Gerichtshof (IGH) in Den Haag hat mit 15 zu eins Stimmen eine Eingabe Nicaraguas zurückgewiesen, Deutschlands Rüstungsexporte nach Israel mit einem Eilantrag zu stoppen. Es werde keine Dringlichkeitsanordnung erlassen, teilte das Gericht am Dienstag nachmittag mit. Man sei dennoch tief besorgt angesichts der humanitären Situation der palästinensischen Bevölkerung im Gazastreifen. Der Gerichtshof gab aber auch einem deutschen Antrag auf Abweisung des Falles nicht statt, so dass der Prozess weitergeführt werden kann.
Nicaragua wollte mit seiner Klage erreichen, dass das höchste UN-Gericht Deutschland dazu verpflichtet, die Waffenexporte an Israel einzustellen. Nicaragua hatte damit argumentiert, dass im Gazastreifen wegen des Vorgehens des israelischen Militärs die ernste Gefahr eines Völkermords bestehe. Berlin habe daher gegen die Völkermordkonvention von 1948 verstoßen, weil es Israel weiterhin mit Waffen beliefere. Die Richter des IGH hätten zuvor entschieden, es sei plausibel, dass Israel während seines Angriffs auf Gaza einige in der Völkermordkonvention garantierte Rechte verletzt habe. Die israelische Regierung bestreitet dies.
Die Bundesregierung hatte im Vorfeld die Vorwürfe Nicaraguas zurückgewiesen. Sie argumentiert zum einen mit dem Selbstverteidigungsrecht Israels. Zum anderen wird auf die umfangreiche humanitäre Hilfe für die palästinensische Zivilbevölkerung verwiesen. Deutschland gehört hier zu den größten internationalen Geldgebern. Zwar hatte Berlin Zahlungen an das UN-Palästinenserhilfswerk UNRWA in Gaza nach bislang unbewiesenen Anschuldigungen aus Israel, Mitarbeiter desselben seien an dem Angriff der Hamas vom Oktober beteiligt gewesen, zwischenzeitlich unterbrochen. In der vergangenen Woche hatte die Bundesregierung aber entschieden, die Zahlungen an UNRWA wiederaufzunehmen. Auch das war von Nicaragua in seiner Klage neben der Einstellung der Waffenlieferungen verlangt worden.

Article: Ramallah. Beim Besuch eines deutschen Repräsentanten nahe Ramallah im Westjordanland ist es am Dienstag zu wütenden Protesten palästinensischer Studenten gekommen. Der Leiter des deutschen Vertretungsbüros in Ramallah, Oliver Owcza, hatte gemeinsam mit anderen EU-Missionsleitern an einer Tagung im Nationalmuseum auf dem Gelände der Birzeit-Universität teilgenommen. Studentenvertretungen der Hochschule hatten zuvor dazu aufgerufen, sich »denen entgegenzustellen, die das Töten unseres Volkes in Gaza erlauben und den zionistischen deutschen Botschafter von der Universität der Märtyrer zu vertreiben«.
Auf Videoaufnahmen war zu sehen, wie Diplomaten, die das Museum besucht hatten, sich eilig entfernten. Aufgebrachte Studenten rannten ihnen hinterher. Einige rüttelten heftig an der Tür eines Fahrzeugs und brachen dann den Rückspiegel ab. Aus Diplomatenkreisen hieß es allerdings, der deutsche Repräsentant sei nicht auf den Videoaufnahmen zu sehen, die im Internet zirkulierten. Auch das Fahrzeug des Vertretungsbüros sei nicht beschädigt worden.
Owcza schrieb anschließend beim Kurnachrichtendienst X: »Friedliche Proteste und Dialog haben immer ihren Platz.« Er bedauere jedoch, dass ein Treffen von EU-Missionsleitern im Nationalmuseum auf dem Gelände der Universität »ungebührlich von Protestierenden unterbrochen wurde«. Dennoch werde man »die konstruktive Arbeit mit unseren palästinensischen Partnern fortsetzen«. Aus dem Auswärtigen Amt hieß es, die Teilnehmer der Tagung hätten sich angesichts der Proteste »entschieden, aus Sicherheitsgründen den Ort zu verlassen«. (dpa/jW)

Article: Warschau. Polens Ministerpräsident Donald Tusk hat angekündigt, die Regierungszeit der nationalkonservativen Partei Recht und Gerechtigkeit (PiS) nicht nur mit politischen, sondern auch mit juristischen Mitteln aufzuarbeiten. Fälle von Machtmissbrauch der Vorgängerregierung dürften nicht ungestraft bleiben, sagte der ehemalige EU-Ratspräsident in einer Ansprache am Dienstag. Die Regierung der PiS war durch den Sieg eines von Tusk angeführten Bündnisses bei der Parlamentswahl am 15. Oktober beendet worden. »Die Menschen wollen wissen, ob wir diejenigen, die am 15. Oktober verloren haben, für ihre Vergehen zur Verantwortung ziehen werden«, zitierte ihn die Nachrichtenagentur PAP. »Niemand wird all das Böse vergessen, das vor dem 15. Oktober geschehen ist«, versicherte der Regierungschef. Als konkretes Beispiel nannte Tusk den Verdacht, dass der teilstaatliche Ölkonzern Orlen Medienberichten zufolge während der PiS-Regierungszeit mit einem Unternehmer zusammengearbeitet habe, der eine Nähe zur libanesischen Hisbollah gehabt haben soll.
Am selben Tag bestätigte die nationale Staatsanwaltschaft in einer Pressekonferenz, dass sie diesen Verdacht untersuche. Außerdem habe sie bereits Ermittlungen in mindestens zwei anderen Verdachtsfällen in Zusammenhang mit Orlen begonnen. Dabei gehe es um den Verkauf von Raffinerieanteilen und eine umstrittene Firmenfusion, die beide für den Konzern und den polnischen Staat nachteilig gewesen seien. Die Staatsanwaltschaft nehme den Verdacht in allen diesen Fällen sehr ernst, weil es dabei um die Sicherheit Polens gehe, sagte Staatsanwalt Dariusz Korneluk vor Journalisten in Warschau. (dpa/jW)

Article: Berlin. Im TV-Talk bei Lanz ging es um die Frage, ob Bedenken gegen das Aus der Kernenergie wegen grüner Ideologe unterdrückt wurde:
Bundeswirtschaftsminister Robert Habeck hat bestritten, in der Entscheidungsfindung über den Atomausstieg Bedenken innerhalb von Regierungsbehörden unterdrückt zu haben. In der ZDF-Sendung „Markus Lanz“ bekräftigte er am Dienstagabend, in dieser Debatte sei nichts verheimlicht worden. Dem zuständigen Bundestagsausschuss würden alle Akten zur Verfügung gestellt.
Auslöser der Kontroverse war ein Bericht des Magazins „Cicero“, wonach sowohl im Wirtschafts- als auch im Umweltministerium im Frühjahr 2022 interne Bedenken von Fachleuten zum damals noch für den folgenden Jahreswechsel geplanten Atomausstieg unterdrückt worden sein sollen - was beide Ministerien aber bestreiten. Ein „Cicero“-Journalist hatte die Herausgabe der Akten vor Gericht erstritten - und erhielt zwei dicke Aktenordner. Bis dahin hatte Habecks Wirtschaftsministerium nur einen Teil der geforderten Dokumente übergeben und dies mit der Vertraulichkeit der Beratungen begründet.

Habeck: Genau diese Debatte haben wir ja monatelang geführt
Der Wirtschaftsminister wies den Vorwurf zurück, er hätte die Entscheidung zum Atomausstieg anders getroffen, wenn er einen Aktenvermerk eines Referenten gelesen hätte, in dem dieser darüber reflektiert habe, Gas könne bei einem längeren Betrieb von Atomkraftwerken eingespart werden. Zwar habe er diesen Vermerk in der Tat nicht gesehen, aber genau diese Frage sei „rauf und runter“ mit allen im Ministerium und auch mit den Betreibern der Atomkraftwerke diskutiert worden. „Da war auch überhaupt nichts geheim“. Deswegen sei der Vorwurf nicht richtig.

Der Minister bleibt dabei: Es gab keine Brennelemente mehr
Das könne man alles nachlesen in Briefen der Atomkraftwerksbetreiber an ihn und sein Ministerium von März 2022, in denen alle sagten, die Atomkraftwerke und die Brennelemente seien nicht mehr leistungsfähig am Ende des Jahres, die Neubeschaffung sei schwierig. Wäre es anders gewesen, hätte man die Atomkraftwerke zu diesem Zeitpunkt länger betrieben, sagte Habeck.
Die Diskussion um die deutsche Energieversorgung war nach dem Angriff des damals wichtigsten Gaslieferanten Russland auf die Ukraine im Frühjahr 2022 neu aufgeflammt. Am Ende wurde der Betrieb der letzten drei deutschen Atomkraftwerke um einige Monate verlängert. Vor rund einem Jahr wurden sie abgeschaltet.

Moderator Markus Lanz unterstellte, die Entscheidung sei dennoch zu diesem Zeitpunkt letztlich dennoch grüne Ideologie gewesen. Und die Unternehmerin und Präsidentin des Verbandes der Familienunternehmer blieb in der Sendung bei ihrer Kritik: Brennelemente hätte man mit politischen Willen beschaffen können, zum Beispiel bei amerikanischen oder französischen Energiebetrieben. Mit dem weiteren Betrieb der Akw hätte man dann sowohl die Klimaziele besser erreicht, als auch die Energiepreise deutlich günstiger halten können. Eine Kritik, die auch der Bundesrechnungshof vor einiger Zeit an der Abschaltung der Akw festgemacht hatte: Damit habe die Regierung letztlich die Versorgungssicherheit im Lande gefährdet.

Den Neubau von Kraftwerken wies der Wirtschaftsminister zurück. Die Baukosten seien schlicht zu hoch, wie die Beispiele aus Frankreich, Finnland und Großbritannien zeigten.. Dadurch würde Energie deutlich teurer als mit der deutschen Energiewende. (ftg/dpa)

Article: New York. Polizeieinsätze, Festnahmen und ein besetztes Gebäude: An US-Universitäten spitzt sich die Lage um propalästinensische Proteste zu.
Propalästinensischen Demonstrierenden droht nach der Besetzung eines Gebäudes der New Yorker Elite-Universität Columbia der Rausschmiss. Man habe sehr deutlich gemacht, „dass die Arbeit der Universität nicht endlos durch Demonstranten gestört werden kann, die gegen die Regeln verstoßen. Wenn dies weiterhin geschieht, wird dies klare Konsequenzen nach sich ziehen“, hieß es in einer Stellungnahme der Hochschule.
Den Dutzenden Studierenden, die die Hamilton Hall besetzt hielten, drohe der Ausschluss. Auch das Weiße Haus übte deutliche Kritik am Vorgehen der Demonstrantinnen und Demonstranten, die gegen Israels Vorgehen im Gaza-Krieg und die Unterstützung des jüdischen Staates durch die US-Regierung protestieren.
Die seit knapp zwei Wochen andauernden Proteste an der Universität in der liberalen Ostküstenmetropole New York waren eskaliert. Demonstrierende drangen in die Hamilton Hall auf dem Campus im Norden Manhattans ein, die schon 1968 während eines Protests gegen den Vietnam-Krieg besetzt worden war.
Protestwelle im ganzen Land
Auch andere Universitäten sind längst von der Protestwelle erfasst worden. Laut US-Medien wurden seit Beginn der Unmutsbekundungen im ganzen Land mehr als 1000 Demonstranten vorläufig festgenommen - gestern griff die Polizei unter anderem in den Bundesstaaten Kalifornien, Georgia und North Carolina ein.
Am Montag hatte die Columbia-Universität angekündigt, Studentinnen und Studenten zu suspendieren, sollten sie ein Protestcamp auf dem Universitätsgelände nicht bis zum Nachmittag verlassen. Doch das Gegenteil geschah: Auf Videos vom Campus war zu sehen, wie Vermummte mit schwarz-weißen Palästinensertüchern Fenster einschlagen und den Eingang der Hamilton Hall mit Stühlen und Tischen verbarrikadieren. Nach Angaben der Studierendenzeitung „Columbia Spectator“ drangen mehrere Dutzend Protestierende in das Gebäude ein, während Hunderte weitere davor demonstrierten.
Die Studierendengruppen „Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine“ und „Columbia University Apartheid Divest“ kündigten an, die Hamilton Hall nicht zu verlassen, bis ihre Forderungen erfüllt würden. „Ein Gebäude zu besetzen, ist ein geringes Risiko im Vergleich zum täglichen Widerstand der Palästinenser im Gazastreifen“, hieß es in einer auf der Plattform X, früher Twitter, verbreiteten Stellungnahme. Die Demonstrierenden kritisieren das Vorgehen Israels im Gaza-Krieg und fordern Solidarität mit den Palästinensern. Außerdem verlangen sie von der Hochschule, finanzielle Beziehungen mit Israel zu kappen. Die Universität lehnte das bisher ab.
UN-Generalsekretär: Freie Meinungsäußerung muss möglich sein
Auch die US-Regierung reagierte auf die Besetzung während der Nacht: „Die gewaltsame Übernahme eines Gebäudes auf dem Campus ist der absolut falsche Weg. Das ist kein Beispiel für friedlichen Protest“, sagte der Kommunikationsdirektor des Nationalen Sicherheitsrats, John Kirby. Ein kleiner Prozentsatz von Studierenden sollte nicht in der Lage sein, die akademische Ausbildung aller zu stören. „Studenten, die für ihren Universitätsbesuch bezahlen und eine Ausbildung anstreben, sollten dieser ungestört folgen können, und sie sollten sich dabei sicher fühlen können“, sagte Kirby. Hassrede und Symbole des Hasses hätten in den USA keinen Platz.
UN-Generalsekretär António Guterres wandte sich ebenfalls gegen Hassrede, betonte aber auch, dass freie Meinungsäußerung möglich sein müsse. Die Universitäten sollten ihre Weisheit nutzen, um angemessen mit der Situation umzugehen.
Kritik an New Yorker Polizei
Vor knapp zwei Wochen hatte ein Einsatz der New Yorker Polizei an der Columbia-Universität für Aufsehen und Kritik gesorgt, in der Folge kam es an Dutzenden Universitäten in den USA zu Protesten und der Errichtung von Zeltlagern. Einigen Demonstrierenden wird Antisemitismus und die Verharmlosung der islamistischen Hamas vorgeworfen, deren Ziel die Vernichtung des Staates Israel ist.
Israels Präsident Izchak Herzog nannte die „entsetzlichen antisemitischen Aktionen“ an der Universität Columbia zutiefst beunruhigend. „Die amerikanische Wissenschaft muss sich der Bedrohung bewusst werden“, schrieb Herzog auf der Plattform X. Er sprach von „einer klaren und gegenwärtigen Gefahr für die akademische Freiheit und für das Leben der Juden auf dem Campus“. Herzog forderte, antisemitische Aktionen auf dem Campus zu unterbinden.
Die Hamas und andere islamistische Gruppen hatten bei ihrem Überfall auf Israel am 7. Oktober vergangenen Jahres etwa 1200 Menschen getötet und mehr als 250 als Geiseln in den Gazastreifen verschleppt. Israel reagierte darauf mit einer Bodenoffensive und Luftangriffen auf das Küstengebiet. In der Folge wurden nach - unabhängig kaum zu verifizierenden - Angaben der von der Hamas kontrollierten Gesundheitsbehörde seit Kriegsbeginn etwa 34 500 Menschen getötet.

Article: Düsseldorf (dpa/tmn). Der Termin steht: Ein künstliches Gelenk soll eingesetzt oder ein Tumor entfernt werden, stationär im Krankenhaus. Was muss man vor so einem Klinikaufenthalt regeln, wissen, einpacken?
Die Aussicht auf einen Klinikaufenthalt, die ist wohl für niemanden so richtig schön. Nicht nur, weil sich vorab Ängste melden, ob der Eingriff wie geplant verläuft, ob man die Narkose gut verträgt, wie schnell man wortwörtlich wieder auf die Beine kommt. Die Gedanken kreisen vielleicht auch um Fragen wie: Habe ich an alles gedacht, muss ich noch etwas klären? Hier bekommen Sie einen Überblick:
Was muss ich vorab erledigen?
Der Termin für die Krankenhausbehandlung steht, vielleicht hat man Ihnen schon eine Prognose gegeben, wie viele Nächte Sie dort bleiben müssen. Diese Information sollten Sie weitergeben an alle, die mit Ihrer Abwesenheit planen müssen. Zum Beispiel an den Arbeitgeber, wie Verena Querling, Referentin Pflegerecht bei der Verbraucherzentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen, sagt.
Was sonst noch erledigt werden muss? „Das hängt natürlich von der jeweiligen Lebenssituation ab“, sagt Querling. Vielleicht braucht es jemanden, der die Gemüsebeete im Garten in dieser Zeit gießt, die Katze versorgt, den Briefkasten leert, die Tochter zum Turnunterricht fährt. „Am besten spannt man frühzeitig ein Netz, das dann aushelfen kann.“
Und wer springt ein, wenn man zum Beispiel den Partner oder die Mutter pflegt, das aber wegen des Krankenhausaufenthalts für eine Weile nicht kann? Dann kann die Verhinderungspflege eine Option ein. Das bedeutet: Die Pflegeversicherung trägt für Pflegebedürftige der Grade 2 bis 5 die nachgewiesenen Kosten einer Ersatzpflege. Diese Ersatzpflege kann durch einen ambulanten Pflegedienst, durch Einzelpflegekräfte, ehrenamtlich Pflegende, aber auch durch nahe Angehörige erfolgen, heißt es vom Bundesgesundheitsministerium.
Was braucht das Krankenhaus alles von mir?
Ohne Versichertenkarte und Personalausweis geht bei der Anmeldung nichts. Um im Krankenhaus aufgenommen zu werden, muss zudem eine Einweisung vorliegen („Verordnung von Krankenhausbehandlung“), die von Haus- oder Facharzt ausgestellt wird. Wer privat krankenversichert ist, sollte die Kostenzusage der Krankenkasse parat haben.
Sofern man eine Patientenverfügung oder eine Vorsorgevollmacht hat, ist es sinnvoll, auch diese mitzunehmen, rät Verena Querling. Und natürlich sollte man dafür sorgen, dass das Krankenhaus möglichst gut über den eigenen Gesundheitszustand und Besonderheiten Bescheid weiß. Vor einem geplanten Eingriff wird das im Vorgespräch abgefragt.
„Von einem Herzschrittmacher oder einer Prothese müssen die Ärzte natürlich wissen. Und auch, welche Medikamente man einnimmt“, sagt Querling. Allergiker bringen ihren Allergie-Pass mit, wer Blutverdünner einnimmt, sollte seinen Marcumar-Pass einstecken. Die meisten Krankenhäuser geben auf ihrer Webseite auch eine Checkliste, welche Dokumente genau benötigt werden.
Wichtig ist zudem, dem Krankenhaus die Kontaktdaten der Hausarztpraxis zu geben, damit Kommunikation und Austausch von Befunden reibungslos klappen können.
Was kommt ansonsten in die Tasche?
Wenn Sie vor dem Kleiderschrank stehen und überlegen, was in die Kliniktasche wandern soll, sollten Sie diesem Grundsatz folgen: „Worin man sich wohlfühlt und was bequem ist, Kleidungsstücke, in denen man auch den Gang im Krankenhaus runterlaufen würde“, sagt Verena Querling. Gerade bei frischen OP-Narben sind eher weit geschnittene Kleidungsstücke sinnvoll, da drückt nichts.
Hilfsmittel wie Hörgerät oder Brillen müssen natürlich auch mit. Hier gilt besondere Vorsicht, damit sie nicht verloren gehen, wenn man sie vor dem Eingriff ablegt. „Manchmal werden die einfach in Taschentücher gewickelt und sind dann auf einmal weg“, sagt Querling. Besser: sicher in Dose oder Etui verstauen und vorab klären, wie sie wieder den Weg zu einem finden.
Und natürlich sollte man auch Dinge einpacken, die der Langeweile im Krankenhaus etwas entgegensetzen, „ob es das Sudoku-Heft, ein Headset zum Musikhören oder ein schönes Buch ist“, sagt Querling.
Wer Serien streamen will, sollte sich vorab über die WLAN-Situation im Krankenhaus informieren. Einer Auswertung von Verivox aus dem Mai 2023 zufolge bieten 70 Prozent der größten Kliniken und Krankenhäuser in Deutschland kostenloses WLAN auf den Patientenzimmern an. Wer doch für die Internetnutzung zahlen muss, kann sich auf Kosten von etwa drei bis fünf Euro pro Tag einstellen.
Und was bleibt besser zu Hause? Wertsachen, insbesondere Schmuck. „Man muss Ringe und Co. ja ohnehin ausziehen, wenn es in den OP geht“, sagt Querling.
Was kostet mich der Krankenhausaufenthalt?
Die Zuzahlung liegt für gesetzlich Krankenversicherte ab 18 Jahren bei 10 Euro pro Tag. Wer länger als 28 Tage im Kalenderjahr stationär im Krankenhaus behandelt wird, muss ab dem 29. Tag nichts mehr zuzahlen.
Die Krankenhäuser rechnen dabei direkt mit den Patientinnen und Patienten ab, nach der Entlassung landet also eine Rechnung im Briefkasten.
Apropos Entlassung: Was muss ich dafür alles regeln?
Spätestens, wenn sich das Ende des Klinikaufenthalts abzeichnet, kommt das sogenannte Entlassmanagement des Krankenhauses ins Spiel, das meist beim sozialen Dienst liegt. Dessen Ziel ist es, den Übergang zwischen Krankenhausaufenthalt und der Zeit danach möglichst reibungslos zu gestalten.
Je frühzeitiger man Kontakt zum Entlassmanagement aufnimmt, desto besser - gerade dann, wenn man auch über die Klinikzeit hinaus Unterstützung benötigt, rät Verena Querling. Das Entlassmanagement unterstützt bei Anträgen, zum Beispiel auf einen Pflegegrad. Auch Leistungen wie häusliche Krankenpflege, eine Haushaltshilfe oder Pflegehilfsmittel wie Rollstuhl, Pflegebett oder Toilettenstuhl können aus dem Krankenhaus beantragt und organisiert werden. Und wenn man nach dem Krankenhausaufenthalt noch nicht fit genug für zu Hause ist, kann eine Kurzzeitpflege gesucht werden.
Was muss ich wissen, wenn ich mich selbst entlassen möchte?
„Dann gibt es ein Formular, auf dem man noch einmal darauf hingewiesen wird, dass die Entlassung gegen ärztlichen Rat ist“, sagt Verena Querling. Das muss man unterschreiben, wenn man sich selbst entlassen möchte. Dabei geht es um Haftungsfragen. Bleiben durch das vorzeitige Verlassen des Krankenhauses langfristige Schäden zurück, wird es schwierig, diese vor Gericht als ärztlichen Behandlungsfehler anerkennen zu lassen.
Das heißt aber nicht, dass man abgewiesen wird, wenn man doch wieder ärztliche Behandlung benötigt. „Sollte zum Beispiel eine OP-Wunde doch wieder aufgehen, wird man natürlich wieder behandelt“, sagt Verena Querling.
Kann das Krankenhaus mich krankschreiben?
Ja, das ist möglich, für bis zu sieben Tage. „Das verschafft einem ein bisschen Luft, sodass man nicht sofort zum Hausarzt muss, wenn man aus dem Krankenhaus kommt“, sagt Verena Querling.
Gut möglich, dass man sich aber doch zeitnah auf den Weg zur Arztpraxis machen muss, nämlich dann, wenn man Medikamente benötigt. Denn Krankenhäuser dürfen sie nur begrenzt mitgeben bzw. verordnen.
Wird man vor oder an einem Wochenende oder Feiertag entlassen, darf das Krankenhaus nur so viele Medikamente mitgeben, wie es zur Überbrückung dieser Tage braucht. Die Klinik kann Medikamente aber auch verordnen, sodass man sie nach der Entlassung selbst in der Apotheke abholen kann. Möglich ist dabei allerdings höchstens die kleinste Packungsgröße.

Article: Frankfurt/Main/Düsseldorf (dpa/tmn). Eine Operation am Herzen ist kein kleiner Eingriff. Wer bei einer planbaren OP unsicher ist, kann sich eine zweite Meinung einholen. Wann ist sie sinnvoll und an wen kann ich mich wenden?
Klar ist: Eine Zweitmeinung kommt nur dann in Betracht, wenn keine Zeitnot besteht. Darauf weist Professor Thomas Meinertz vom Wissenschaftlichen Beirat der Deutschen Herzstiftung hin. Bei einem Herzinfarkt etwa ist schnelles Handeln gefragt.
Aber vor allem das Wie mancher Behandlung kann durchaus abgewogen werden. Ist ein chirurgischer Eingriff nötig, ist eine OP per Herzkatheter möglich oder reichen vielleicht sogar Medikamente - unterschiedliche Ärzte können das jeweils anders beurteilen.
Besonderes Verfahren für bestimmte OPs
Für bestimmte Operationen gibt es ein spezielles Zweitmeinungsverfahren. Beim Herzen ist das etwa das Einsetzen eines Schrittmachers oder eine Verödung am Herzen. In so einem Fall müssen behandelnder Arzt oder Ärztin sogar mindestens zehn Tage vor der Operation darauf hinweisen, dass eine Beratung bei einem entsprechend qualifizierten Arzt möglich ist. Das erklärt die Verbraucherzentrale NRW auf ihrer Webseite.
Diese Beratung kann man dann annehmen oder nicht. Die entsprechenden Zweitexperten müssen besonders qualifiziert und unabhängig sein und brauchen eine Genehmigung der Kassenärztlichen Vereinigung. Eine Auflistung findet sich auf der Website des ärztlichen Bereitschaftsdienstes.
Selbstständig um Zweitmeinung kümmern
Aber auch bei anderen geplanten Herz-OPs kann eine Zweitmeinung sinnvoll sein, sagt Professor Meinertz. Etwa bei einem Herzklappenersatz oder einer Bypass-Operation. Jeder Patient und jede Patientin hat das Recht, sich diese einzuholen. Aber wo? Sich selbst im Internet umzusehen, hält der Herzexperte wegen zu positiver Selbstdarstellungen für problematisch. Besser erkundige man sich der entsprechenden Krankenkasse oder Ärztekammer.
Auch der behandelnde Arzt oder die Ärztin kann jemanden empfehlen. Denn im Idealfall ist er offen für eine weitere Einschätzung. Ein No-Go sei allerdings, sagt Meinertz, dass einfach ein befreundeter Kollege angerufen werde, der voreingenommen nur die Erstmeinung bestätigen solle. Vielmehr sollte der nach einer zweiten Meinung Gefragte nicht von vornherein auf eine bestimmte Methode festgelegt sein.
Was Patienten und Patientinnen jedoch vermeiden sollten: Noch eine Dritt- oder gar Viertmeinung einzuholen. Das verunsichert laut dem Herzspezialisten am Ende nur.

Article: Teheran. Ramin Yektarapast soll sowohl bei einem Mord in Duisburg als auch bei einem Anschlag auf eine Bochumer Schule die Fäden gezogen haben.
Im Iran ist ein international gesuchter früherer Boss des Rockerclubs „Hells Angels“ getötet worden. Wie die iranische Nachrichtenagentur Tasnim am Dienstag berichtete, kam Ramin Yektaparast nach ersten Informationen bei einem persönlichen Konflikt ums Leben. Yektaparast, einst Vize der Hells Angels in Oberhausen und später Chef des Charters in Mönchengladbach besaß auch die deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft und wurde wegen Mordes und Mordversuchs gesucht.
Rockerboss organisierte auf Geheiß der iranischen Regierung Attentat in NRW
Tasnim wies zugleich Berichte zurück, denen zufolge Irans Erzfeind Israel für die Tötung des Mannes verantwortlich sein soll. Iranische Exil-Medien hatten zuvor berichtet, dass Yektaparast als mutmaßliches Mitglied der mächtigen iranischen Revolutionsgarden Ziel eines Mordanschlags gewesen sein soll.
Hauptverdächtiger in einem Mord mit zerstückelter Leiche
Der Ex-Rockerboss war im Dezember bei einem Prozess vor dem Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf auch als Auftraggeber für einen Brandanschlag auf eine Bochumer Schule benannt worden. Ziel war ab er eigentlich eine benachbarte Synagoge. Nach Überzeugung des Gerichts ging die Tat auf eine staatliche iranische Stelle zurück. Für die Landesregierung in NRW war der Fall ein deutlicher Hinweis, wie iranische Stellen in dem Bundesland ihr Unwesen treiben.

Yektaparast galt zudem als Hauptverdächtiger im Fall eines ermordeten Rockers, dessen Leiche zerstückelt wurde und dessen Arm in einem Duisburger Hafenbecken auftgauchte. (ftg/dpa)

Article: Berlin (dpa/tmn). Lifehacks im Netz versprechen für fast jedes Problem eine simple Lösung. Ob der Tipp hält, was er verspricht, testen wir mit unserem Hack-Check.
Welche Ketten kommen mit in den Urlaub? Am liebsten alle. Das Problem: Lose im Kosmetiktäschchen oder Kulturbeutel verstaut, können sie sich verknoten oder ineinander verheddern. Das Entwirren kann eine Weile dauern. Also besser vorbeugen - doch was hilft gegen das Ketten-Wirrwarr?
TikTok, Instagram und Co. sind voll von Lifehacks, für fast jedes Problem gibt es eine simple Lösung, die nur wenige Handgriffe erfordert und nicht teuer sein soll. Für das Kettenchaos sollen Strohhalme die rettende Lösung sein.
Doch wir wissen, dass das Internet nicht immer die Wahrheit sagt. Deshalb haben wir den Tipp für knotenfreie Ketten in unserem Hack-Check getestet. Hält der Lifehack was er verspricht - oder ist er ein Flop?
Und so geht's: Für jede Kette braucht man einen Strohhalm - am besten aus Papier, das ist nachhaltiger. Die Kette wird durch den Strohhalm gefädelt und verschlossen - fertig. Bei kürzeren Ketten kann man den Strohhalm einfach abschneiden.
Fazit: Der Hack funktioniert ausgezeichnet. Auch wenn man viele Ketten auf einmal in eine Tasche packt, lassen sie sich dank der Strohhalme wieder leicht voneinander trennen.

Article: Berlin (dpa/tmn). Fenster, Fassade, Dach: Die energetische Sanierung des Eigenheims kann richtig teuer werden. Wer von Steuervorteilen profitieren möchte, tut aber gut daran, die Maßnahmen nicht in Raten zu begleichen.
Wer seine mindestens zehn Jahre alte, zu eigenen Wohnzwecken genutzte Immobilie einer energetischen Sanierung unterzieht, kann dabei steuerlich profitieren. Die Kosten des ausführenden Fachunternehmens sind zu 20 Prozent absetzbar - bis zu einer Höchstgrenze von 40.000 Euro und verteilt über einen Zeitraum von drei Jahren. Wichtige Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass Steuerzahlerinnen und Steuerzahler parallel keine anderen Fördermittel der KfW oder des Bundesamts für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle (BAFA) in Anspruch nehmen. Und, dass sie den Aufwand nicht in Raten bezahlen. Sonst ist der Bonus unter Umständen verspielt.
Genau das ist Steuerzahlern bereits passiert. Auf ein entsprechendes Urteil des Finanzgerichts München (Az.: 8 K 1534/23) verweist der Bund der Steuerzahler. In dem konkreten Fall hatte ein Paar in seinem Einfamilienhaus eine neue Heizungsanlage einbauen lassen. Preis: rund 8120 Euro. Im Jahr der Fertigstellung bezahlte das Paar aber zunächst nur 2000 Euro, der restliche Betrag sollte in Raten abgestottert werden. Das zuständige Finanzamt versagte dem Paar den Steuerabzug daraufhin. Zurecht, wie das Gericht später feststellte.
Aufwand und Zahlung müssen in einem Jahr zusammenfallen
„Ausgaben werden im Steuerrecht in der Regel nur in dem Jahr berücksichtigt, in dem sie anfallen“, sagt Daniela Karbe-Geßler vom Bund der Steuerzahler. Zum vollständigen Abschluss einer energetischen Maßnahme zählt aber eben nicht nur die Fertigstellung durch die Handwerker. Auch die vollständige Bezahlung der Arbeiten ist dafür notwendige Bedingung.
Wird die Maßnahme im Jahr der Installation nicht vollständig bezahlt, fallen Aufwand und Zahlung nicht zusammen, wodurch die Kosten grundsätzlich nicht absetzbar sind - weder in Teilen noch zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt.
„Deshalb ist es nach aktueller Rechtsprechung wichtig, den Rechnungsbetrag im Jahr der Fertigstellung der Maßnahme komplett und nicht in Raten zu zahlen“, so Karbe-Geßler. Denn selbst wenn alle anderen Voraussetzungen vorbildlich erfüllt sind, also etwa die erforderlichen Bescheinigungen über die Maßnahme vorliegen und die Steuererklärung korrekt ausgefüllt wurde, kann es am Ende genau an der Zahlungsmethode scheitern.

Article: Wolfsburg/Langenfeld (dpa/tmn). Ein Foto und die wichtigsten Stationen des Lebenslaufs: Reicht das schon, um via Jobnetzwerk eine neue Stelle zu finden? Wohl kaum. Ein Recruiter und eine Coachin teilen ihre besten Ratschläge.
Haben Sie ein Profil bei Xing, LinkedIn oder ähnlichen Jobnetzwerken? Für Recruiterinnen und Recruiter sind sie mittlerweile enorm wichtig, wenn es um die Besetzung von Stellen geht. Dabei kommt es aber auch darauf an, wie Jobsuchende die Portale nutzen. Diese Tipps sollten sie befolgen:
1. Profil mit beruflichen Details füttern
Peter Nollido, Senior Recruiter bei Volkswagen, sucht regelmäßig auch in Jobnetzwerken nach potenziellen neuen Mitarbeitern. Dabei achte er auf ein vollständiges Profil, in dem neben bisherigen Berufsstationen vor allem Kenntnisse, Fähigkeiten oder Weiterbildungen angegeben sein sollten.
„Oft fehlen uns als Personaler genauere Details, womit die Kandidaten in ihrem beruflichen Alltag zu tun haben“, sagt Nollido. Je mehr Kenntnisse jemand angibt, desto sichtbarer werde er im Netzwerk. Dabei sollten vor allem auch fachliche Spezialisierungen Erwähnung finden, sofern sie für die Jobsuche relevant sein könnten.
2. Auf richtige Einstellungen achten
Jobsuchende sollten darauf achten, das eigene Profil offen zu schalten. Nur so können Personalerinnen und Personaler die Profilinformationen einsehen. „Berufsbezogene Daten fallen nicht unter den Datenschutz. Am Ende sehen wir auch nur den Namen der Person. Da rate ich zu etwas mehr Mut“, so Nollido.
Auch ein aktuelles Foto hält der Recruiter für sinnvoll. „Hier hat man, beispielsweise bei LinkedIn, die Möglichkeit, einen Rahmen um das Bild legen zu lassen, in dem #OpenToWork steht. Als Personaler werden wir direkt informiert, wenn ein Kandidat aus unserem Netzwerk diese Frame-Einstellung gemacht hat.“
Gehaltsvorstellungen dagegen haben nichts auf dem Profil verloren, findet der Experte. „Das kann dazu führen, schon vorzeitig aussortiert zu werden.“ Das Gehalt sei ein wichtiges und sensibles Thema, das erst im direkten Gespräch aufkommen sollte.
3. Mut bei Kontaktanfragen
VW-Recruiter Nollido empfiehlt, sich bei Interesse an einem konkreten Unternehmen mit dem Personaler oder dem einstellenden Fachbereich zu verbinden. „Durch diesen Kontakt erhält man regelmäßig alle wichtigen Informationen über den Fachbereich, Aktivitäten des Unternehmens oder offene Stellen.“
Und auch über ganz direkte Nachfragen freut sich Peter Nollido. „Selbst wenn heute keine vakante Stelle vorhanden ist, weiß ich so trotzdem, dass der Kandidat Interesse hat. Ich habe dann die Möglichkeit, diesen Kandidaten zu speichern.“ Daraus ergebe sich oft die Möglichkeit zu einem weiteren Austausch.
4. Den gegenseitigen Austausch suchen
„Karrierenetzwerke sind nicht nur dafür da, um auf der Karriereleiter den nächsten Schritt zu machen“, sagt Beraterin Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig. Sie dienen der Coachin zufolge auch dazu, sich über verschiedene Themen zu informieren und auszutauschen.
Wer sich etwa zu einer bestimmten Branche oder einem Fachthema informieren möchte, könne sich mit entsprechenden Spezialisten vernetzen. „Ich kann auch schauen, ob ich im Netzwerk jemanden finde, der genau den Job hat, der mich interessiert, und um einen Austausch bitten. Die meisten Menschen sind positiv gestimmt und beantworten gerne Fragen.“
5. Langfristig denken
Wer von einem Karrierenetzwerk profitieren will, sollte frühzeitig damit anfangen, es zu pflegen. „Es ist ganz wichtig, das Netzwerk langfristig aufzubauen. Das unterschätzen viele. Ein Netzwerk muss bereits da sein, wenn ich es brauche“, sagt Herrmann-Hurtzig.
Das funktioniere aber nur, wenn das Netzwerk als Ort des Nehmens und Geben verstanden würde. „Viele Leute denken, sie könnten nichts geben, aber das stimmt oft nicht. Unabhängig vom Lebensalter kann jeder etwas geben, hat jeder Qualifikationen oder Kompetenzen, die das Netzwerk bereichern.“
6. Lesen, speichern, teilen: Auf Netzwerken aktiv bleiben
Der Schlüssel für ein intaktes Netzwerk liegt dabei auch in der eigenen Aktivität. Wer nie Beiträge anschaut, speichert, kommentiert oder teilt, wird nicht wahrgenommen. „Dann geht das System davon aus, dass kein Interesse an einem Jobwechsel besteht und man rutscht in der Suche ganz weit nach unten“, sagt Peter Nollido.
Zu Beginn kann es hilfreich sein, sich andere Profile aus ähnlichen Branchen oder Interessengebieten anzuschauen. „Dann vernetze ich mich mit allen Kontakten, die ich in meiner eigenen Branche brauche. Da sollte man keine Scheu haben“, rät Nollido.
7. Anfragen richtig beurteilen
Vorsicht ist geboten, wenn Anfragen kommen, hinter denen keine offizielle Firma steckt. „Manche Unternehmen sammeln nur Daten und geben diese dann weiter. Da würde ich prüfen, ob es die Firma überhaupt gibt, ob sie eine Webseite hat und so weiter“, sagt Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig.
Ein weiteres Indiz für einen Betrug sind generisch formulierte Nachrichten, die sich nicht auf das eigene Profil beziehen, sagt Peter Nollido.
Ein bisschen Geduld braucht es manchmal, wenn Headhunter eingeschaltet wurden. In diesem Fall ist es nicht unüblich, dass zunächst keine Informationen über die vakante Stelle oder die suchende Firma geteilt werden dürfen. Spätestens im zweiten Kontakt aber sollte die Anfrage deutlich konkreter werden, sagt Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig.

UN-Generalsekretär: Freie Meinungsäußerung muss möglich sein
Auch die US-Regierung reagierte auf die Besetzung während der Nacht: „Die gewaltsame Übernahme eines Gebäudes auf dem Campus ist der absolut falsche Weg. Das ist kein Beispiel für friedlichen Protest“, sagte der Kommunikationsdirektor des Nationalen Sicherheitsrats, John Kirby. Ein kleiner Prozentsatz von Studierenden sollte nicht in der Lage sein, die akademische Ausbildung aller zu stören. „Studenten, die für ihren Universitätsbesuch bezahlen und eine Ausbildung anstreben, sollten dieser ungestört folgen können, und sie sollten sich dabei sicher fühlen können“, sagte Kirby. Hassrede und Symbole des Hasses hätten in den USA keinen Platz.
UN-Generalsekretär António Guterres wandte sich ebenfalls gegen Hassrede, betonte aber auch, dass freie Meinungsäußerung möglich sein müsse. Die Universitäten sollten ihre Weisheit nutzen, um angemessen mit der Situation umzugehen.
Kritik an New Yorker Polizei
Vor knapp zwei Wochen hatte ein Einsatz der New Yorker Polizei an der Columbia-Universität für Aufsehen und Kritik gesorgt, in der Folge kam es an Dutzenden Universitäten in den USA zu Protesten und der Errichtung von Zeltlagern. Einigen Demonstrierenden wird Antisemitismus und die Verharmlosung der islamistischen Hamas vorgeworfen, deren Ziel die Vernichtung des Staates Israel ist.
Israels Präsident Izchak Herzog nannte die „entsetzlichen antisemitischen Aktionen“ an der Universität Columbia zutiefst beunruhigend. „Die amerikanische Wissenschaft muss sich der Bedrohung bewusst werden“, schrieb Herzog auf der Plattform X. Er sprach von „einer klaren und gegenwärtigen Gefahr für die akademische Freiheit und für das Leben der Juden auf dem Campus“. Herzog forderte, antisemitische Aktionen auf dem Campus zu unterbinden.
Die Hamas und andere islamistische Gruppen hatten bei ihrem Überfall auf Israel am 7. Oktober vergangenen Jahres etwa 1200 Menschen getötet und mehr als 250 als Geiseln in den Gazastreifen verschleppt. Israel reagierte darauf mit einer Bodenoffensive und Luftangriffen auf das Küstengebiet. In der Folge wurden nach - unabhängig kaum zu verifizierenden - Angaben der von der Hamas kontrollierten Gesundheitsbehörde seit Kriegsbeginn etwa 34 500 Menschen getötet.

Article: Wolfsburg/Langenfeld · Ein Foto und die wichtigsten Stationen des Lebenslaufs: Reicht das schon, um via Jobnetzwerk eine neue Stelle zu finden? Wohl kaum. Ein Recruiter und eine Coachin teilen ihre besten Ratschläge.
Haben Sie ein Profil bei Xing, LinkedIn oder ähnlichen Jobnetzwerken? Für Recruiterinnen und Recruiter sind sie mittlerweile enorm wichtig, wenn es um die Besetzung von Stellen geht. Dabei kommt es aber auch darauf an, wie Jobsuchende die Portale nutzen. Diese Tipps sollten sie befolgen:
1. Profil mit beruflichen Details füttern
Peter Nollido, Senior Recruiter bei Volkswagen, sucht regelmäßig auch in Jobnetzwerken nach potenziellen neuen Mitarbeitern. Dabei achte er auf ein vollständiges Profil, in dem neben bisherigen Berufsstationen vor allem Kenntnisse, Fähigkeiten oder Weiterbildungen angegeben sein sollten.
„Oft fehlen uns als Personaler genauere Details, womit die Kandidaten in ihrem beruflichen Alltag zu tun haben“, sagt Nollido. Je mehr Kenntnisse jemand angibt, desto sichtbarer werde er im Netzwerk. Dabei sollten vor allem auch fachliche Spezialisierungen Erwähnung finden, sofern sie für die Jobsuche relevant sein könnten.
2. Auf richtige Einstellungen achten
Jobsuchende sollten darauf achten, das eigene Profil offen zu schalten. Nur so können Personalerinnen und Personaler die Profilinformationen einsehen. „Berufsbezogene Daten fallen nicht unter den Datenschutz. Am Ende sehen wir auch nur den Namen der Person. Da rate ich zu etwas mehr Mut“, so Nollido.
Auch ein aktuelles Foto hält der Recruiter für sinnvoll. „Hier hat man, beispielsweise bei LinkedIn, die Möglichkeit, einen Rahmen um das Bild legen zu lassen, in dem #OpenToWork steht. Als Personaler werden wir direkt informiert, wenn ein Kandidat aus unserem Netzwerk diese Frame-Einstellung gemacht hat.“
Gehaltsvorstellungen dagegen haben nichts auf dem Profil verloren, findet der Experte. „Das kann dazu führen, schon vorzeitig aussortiert zu werden.“ Das Gehalt sei ein wichtiges und sensibles Thema, das erst im direkten Gespräch aufkommen sollte.
3. Mut bei Kontaktanfragen
VW-Recruiter Nollido empfiehlt, sich bei Interesse an einem konkreten Unternehmen mit dem Personaler oder dem einstellenden Fachbereich zu verbinden. „Durch diesen Kontakt erhält man regelmäßig alle wichtigen Informationen über den Fachbereich, Aktivitäten des Unternehmens oder offene Stellen.“
Und auch über ganz direkte Nachfragen freut sich Peter Nollido. „Selbst wenn heute keine vakante Stelle vorhanden ist, weiß ich so trotzdem, dass der Kandidat Interesse hat. Ich habe dann die Möglichkeit, diesen Kandidaten zu speichern.“ Daraus ergebe sich oft die Möglichkeit zu einem weiteren Austausch.
4. Den gegenseitigen Austausch suchen
„Karrierenetzwerke sind nicht nur dafür da, um auf der Karriereleiter den nächsten Schritt zu machen“, sagt Beraterin Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig. Sie dienen der Coachin zufolge auch dazu, sich über verschiedene Themen zu informieren und auszutauschen.
Wer sich etwa zu einer bestimmten Branche oder einem Fachthema informieren möchte, könne sich mit entsprechenden Spezialisten vernetzen. „Ich kann auch schauen, ob ich im Netzwerk jemanden finde, der genau den Job hat, der mich interessiert, und um einen Austausch bitten. Die meisten Menschen sind positiv gestimmt und beantworten gerne Fragen.“
5. Langfristig denken
Wer von einem Karrierenetzwerk profitieren will, sollte frühzeitig damit anfangen, es zu pflegen. „Es ist ganz wichtig, das Netzwerk langfristig aufzubauen. Das unterschätzen viele. Ein Netzwerk muss bereits da sein, wenn ich es brauche“, sagt Herrmann-Hurtzig.
Das funktioniere aber nur, wenn das Netzwerk als Ort des Nehmens und Geben verstanden würde. „Viele Leute denken, sie könnten nichts geben, aber das stimmt oft nicht. Unabhängig vom Lebensalter kann jeder etwas geben, hat jeder Qualifikationen oder Kompetenzen, die das Netzwerk bereichern.“
6. Lesen, speichern, teilen: Auf Netzwerken aktiv bleiben
Der Schlüssel für ein intaktes Netzwerk liegt dabei auch in der eigenen Aktivität. Wer nie Beiträge anschaut, speichert, kommentiert oder teilt, wird nicht wahrgenommen. „Dann geht das System davon aus, dass kein Interesse an einem Jobwechsel besteht und man rutscht in der Suche ganz weit nach unten“, sagt Peter Nollido.
Zu Beginn kann es hilfreich sein, sich andere Profile aus ähnlichen Branchen oder Interessengebieten anzuschauen. „Dann vernetze ich mich mit allen Kontakten, die ich in meiner eigenen Branche brauche. Da sollte man keine Scheu haben“, rät Nollido.
7. Anfragen richtig beurteilen
Vorsicht ist geboten, wenn Anfragen kommen, hinter denen keine offizielle Firma steckt. „Manche Unternehmen sammeln nur Daten und geben diese dann weiter. Da würde ich prüfen, ob es die Firma überhaupt gibt, ob sie eine Webseite hat und so weiter“, sagt Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig.
Ein weiteres Indiz für einen Betrug sind generisch formulierte Nachrichten, die sich nicht auf das eigene Profil beziehen, sagt Peter Nollido.
Ein bisschen Geduld braucht es manchmal, wenn Headhunter eingeschaltet wurden. In diesem Fall ist es nicht unüblich, dass zunächst keine Informationen über die vakante Stelle oder die suchende Firma geteilt werden dürfen. Spätestens im zweiten Kontakt aber sollte die Anfrage deutlich konkreter werden, sagt Tanja Herrmann-Hurtzig.

Article: Berlin · Wenn das Auto streikt, hilft manchmal nur noch Abschleppen. Doch so einfach ist das nicht. Denn Abschleppen ist nicht immer erlaubt - und auch nicht bei allen Fahrzeugtypen.
Der Motor geht aus, im Cockpit leuchten sämtliche Warnlampen, alle Startversuche schlagen fehl. Der Wagen streikt. Wer dann nicht auf die Hilfe eines professionellen Abschleppunternehmens setzen will, muss sich abschleppen lassen. Dabei müssen aber einige Dinge beachtet werden.
Ist das Abschleppen immer erlaubt?
Nein. Laut geltender Gesetzgebung muss ein gerechtfertigter Notstand vorliegen, bevor ein Fahrzeug an den Haken genommen werden darf, erklärt Matthias Strixner von Tüv Süd: „Ein leerer Tank etwa ist kein Grund zum Abschleppen.“ Dann müsste man sich via Reservetank selbst behelfen oder einen Pannendienst zur Hilfe holen.
Auch eine leere Batterie oder der Ausfall der Elektrik berechtigten nicht zum Abschleppen, denn beide Fahrzeuge müssten mit aktivierten Warnblinkern unterwegs sein.
Kann der Wagen nicht vor Ort repariert werden, muss der Havarist auf dem kürzesten Weg in die nächste Werkstatt geschleppt werden.
Abschleppen: Warnweste an und Abschleppöse suchen
Führt kein Weg am Abschleppen vorbei, braucht es einige Vorsichtsmaßnahmen. „Im ersten Schritt sollte eine Warnweste angezogen und die Gefahrenstelle abgesichert werden“, sagt Jeannine Ulm vom Auto Club Europa (ACE). Dann müssen die Fahrzeuge präpariert werden. Neuere Fahrzeuge verfügen über Abschleppösen, die zunächst eingeschraubt werden müssen. Meist befindet sich das entsprechende Gewinde im Bereich der Stoßstange hinter einer Plastikkappe, die zuvor entfernt werden muss.
Was gilt beim Abschleppen auf der Autobahn?
Wer auf der Autobahn liegenbleibt, für den gelten besondere Regeln. Der ADAC weist darauf hin, dass dort nur abgeschleppt werden darf, wenn die Panne auch dort passiert. Dann gelte es, die Autobahn mit dem havarierten Fahrzeug auf dem kürzesten Weg zu verlassen. Als Transferweg zwischen Pannenort und Werkstatt darf die Autobahn nicht genutzt werden.
Mit welchem Auto sollte abgeschleppt werden?
Hier sind die Kräfteverhältnisse wichtig: „Das Zugfahrzeug muss ordnungsgemäß angemeldet sein und sollte schwerer und größer sein als das abzuschleppende Fahrzeug“, rät Philipp Mathey von Automobil-Club Verkehr (ACV). Wichtig: Auf die maximal erlaubte Zugkraft des Abschleppseils bzw. der Abschleppstange achten.
Abschleppstange oder Abschleppseil?
Beide Varianten haben Vor- und Nachteile. „Am besten geeignet sind Nylonseile. Sie dehnen sich und fangen so ruckartige Bewegungen auf“, sagt Matthias Strixner. In jedem Fall aber müssten beide Varianten ausreichend dimensioniert sein und der lichte Abstand zwischen beiden Fahrzeugen darf nicht mehr als fünf Meter betragen.
Zudem müssen Seil oder Stange in der Mitte für andere Verkehrsteilnehmer ausreichend sichtbar und kenntlich gemacht werden, zum Beispiel durch einen roten Lappen oder ein Fähnchen. Abschleppstangen sind Strixner zufolge am sichersten, aber auch sperrig und im Vergleich zu Seilen teurer. Dafür sorgt die Stange immer für den richtigen Abstand. Wird mit einem Seil abgeschleppt, muss dieses immer unter Spannung gehalten werden.
Beim Abschleppen: Zündung ein und langsam fahren
Seil oder Stange sollten nie diagonal zum Einsatz kommen, da der Pannenwagen ansonsten in den Gegenverkehr oder auf den Gehweg gezogen werden könnte, warnt Strixner. Wichtig zudem: Das Lenkradschloss darf nicht plötzlich einrasten können. Es muss also muss je nach Ausführung die Fahrposition des Zündschlosses aktiviert sein.
Ansonsten gelte es, mit sehr gemäßigtem Tempo und besonders hoher Aufmerksamkeit unterwegs zu sein. „Es gibt keine Höchstgeschwindigkeit beim Abschleppen. Aber es empfiehlt sich, maximal 50 km/h zu fahren, weil bei ausgeschaltetem Motor des Pannenautos auch Bremsverstärker und Servolenkung nicht aktiviert sind“, sagt Philipp Mathey vom ACV. Sonst reicht die Bremskraft eventuell nicht aus und man fährt schlimmstenfalls auf das abschleppende Fahrzeug auf.
Wichtig: Kommunizieren
Bevor sich ein Abschleppgespann in Bewegung setzt, sollten sich die Beteiligten absprechen, wie sie sich während der Fahrt verständigen. Ideal ist hierfür die Freisprecheinrichtung des Mobiltelefons. Da beide Fahrzeuge mit Warnblinkern unterwegs sind, muss das Blinken zudem via Handzeichen aus dem Fenster erfolgen. „Das ist insbesondere beim Rechtsabbiegen anspruchsvoll. Hier kann man aus dem linken Fenster heraus über das Autodach nach rechts zeigen“, rät Mathey.
Vorsicht bei Abschleppen von Automatik und Allrad
Fahrzeuge mit Schaltgetriebe können problemlos im Leerlauf abgeschleppt werden, bei einem Automatikgetriebe jedoch gibt es mitunter Einschränkungen. Hier muss die Schaltstufe N gewählt werden. „Viele Automatikgetriebe aber sind empfindlich und können nur für einige Kilometer gefahrlos abgeschleppt werden“, sagt ACV-Experte Mathey.
Der Grund sei die starke Wärmeentwicklung beim Abschleppen, die Schäden verursachen könne. Bei vielen modernen Automatikmodellen jedoch lasse sich die Verbindung zwischen Antriebsachse und Getriebe entriegeln. Auch für Allradfahrzeuge kann es Einschränkungen geben. Daher empfiehlt sich vor dem Abschleppen immer ein Blick in die Betriebsanleitung.
Sonderfall E-Auto
E-Autos sollten besser gar nicht abgeschleppt werden. „Die Räder drehen die Elektromotoren mit, wodurch die Motoren Strom erzeugen. Das Auto aber ist nicht betriebsbereit, dadurch kann die Leistungselektronik oder die Batterie beschädigt werden“, warnt Jeannine Ulm. Gleiches gelte auch für Hybridfahrzeuge. Wer mit einem Stromer oder Hybridfahrzeug liegenbleibt, sollte den Wagen daher von einem Abschleppunternehmen Huckepack in die Werkstatt bringen lassen.
Abschleppen ist auch ohne Führerschein möglich
Wird ein Auto abgeschleppt, darf der Pannenwagen auch von einer Person ohne gültige Fahrerlaubnis gesteuert werden. „Es empfiehlt sich aber, einen erfahrenen und geeigneten Fahrer ans Lenkrad des defekten Autos zu setzen, da der Abstand zwischen dem ziehenden Fahrzeug und dem Pannenwagen sehr kurz ist und dadurch die Reaktionszeiten sehr gering sind“, rät Matthias Strixner. Krafträder dürfen übrigens gar nicht abgeschleppt werden.
Wer zahlt bei Schäden?
Kommt es beim privaten Abschleppen zu einem Unfall, ist laut ACE zunächst einmal jedes Fahrzeug für sich zu betrachten. „Nach der aktuellen Rechtsprechung wird das abgeschleppte Fahrzeug nicht zum Anhänger“, so Jeannine Ulm. Wenn daher keinem der Fahrzeugführer:innen ein Vorwurf gemacht werden könne, würden beide in gleichem Umfang haften und somit auch ihre jeweiligen Versicherungen.

Article: Berlin · Fenster, Fassade, Dach: Die energetische Sanierung des Eigenheims kann richtig teuer werden. Wer von Steuervorteilen profitieren möchte, tut aber gut daran, die Maßnahmen nicht in Raten zu begleichen.
Wer seine mindestens zehn Jahre alte, zu eigenen Wohnzwecken genutzte Immobilie einer energetischen Sanierung unterzieht, kann dabei steuerlich profitieren. Die Kosten des ausführenden Fachunternehmens sind zu 20 Prozent absetzbar - bis zu einer Höchstgrenze von 40.000 Euro und verteilt über einen Zeitraum von drei Jahren. Wichtige Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass Steuerzahlerinnen und Steuerzahler parallel keine anderen Fördermittel der KfW oder des Bundesamts für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle (BAFA) in Anspruch nehmen. Und, dass sie den Aufwand nicht in Raten bezahlen. Sonst ist der Bonus unter Umständen verspielt.
Genau das ist Steuerzahlern bereits passiert. Auf ein entsprechendes Urteil des Finanzgerichts München (Az.: 8 K 1534/23) verweist der Bund der Steuerzahler. In dem konkreten Fall hatte ein Paar in seinem Einfamilienhaus eine neue Heizungsanlage einbauen lassen. Preis: rund 8120 Euro. Im Jahr der Fertigstellung bezahlte das Paar aber zunächst nur 2000 Euro, der restliche Betrag sollte in Raten abgestottert werden. Das zuständige Finanzamt versagte dem Paar den Steuerabzug daraufhin. Zurecht, wie das Gericht später feststellte.
Aufwand und Zahlung müssen in einem Jahr zusammenfallen
„Ausgaben werden im Steuerrecht in der Regel nur in dem Jahr berücksichtigt, in dem sie anfallen“, sagt Daniela Karbe-Geßler vom Bund der Steuerzahler. Zum vollständigen Abschluss einer energetischen Maßnahme zählt aber eben nicht nur die Fertigstellung durch die Handwerker. Auch die vollständige Bezahlung der Arbeiten ist dafür notwendige Bedingung.
Wird die Maßnahme im Jahr der Installation nicht vollständig bezahlt, fallen Aufwand und Zahlung nicht zusammen, wodurch die Kosten grundsätzlich nicht absetzbar sind - weder in Teilen noch zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt.
„Deshalb ist es nach aktueller Rechtsprechung wichtig, den Rechnungsbetrag im Jahr der Fertigstellung der Maßnahme komplett und nicht in Raten zu zahlen“, so Karbe-Geßler. Denn selbst wenn alle anderen Voraussetzungen vorbildlich erfüllt sind, also etwa die erforderlichen Bescheinigungen über die Maßnahme vorliegen und die Steuererklärung korrekt ausgefüllt wurde, kann es am Ende genau an der Zahlungsmethode scheitern.

Article: Köln · Die hauchdünnen Streifen des grünen Spargels werden bei Food-Bloggerin Julia Uehren nur blanchiert. So bleiben sie knackig und bilden im Nudelsalat einen schönen Kontrast zu den weichen Linguini.
Die Spargel-Saison ist in vollem Gange. Wer den Geschmack besonders intensiv auskosten möchte, serviert grünen Spargel mit handgemachtem grünem Spargelpesto. Als Nudelsalat macht das Gericht eine hervorragende Figur zum Grillen oder auf dem Buffet.
Der Spargel wird in diesem Rezept in hauchdünne Streifen geschnitten und nur kurz blanchiert. Das sieht nicht nur hübsch aus, sondern sorgt auch dafür, dass sich der Spargel gut mit den Linguine vermengen lässt. Gleichzeitig bildet er aber mit seinem knackigen Biss auch einen schönen Kontrapunkt zu den weichen Nudeln.
Sein besonders Aroma erhält der Nudelsalat zum einen durch das frische Dressing aus Weißweinessig, Olivenöl und Zitrone und zum anderen durch das cremige Pesto aus grünem Spargel, gerösteten Pinienkernen, Parmesan, Knoblauch und Petersilie.
Zutaten für 4 Portionen:
750 g grüner Spargel1 TL Zucker1 TL Salz1 TL Butter300 g Linguine30 g Pinienkerne20 g Parmesan (am Stück)15 g Petersilie1 Bio-Zitrone1 Zehe Knoblauch2 EL Weißweinessig3 EL OlivenölPfeffer
Zubereitung:
1. Spargel gründlich waschen und das untere Drittel schälen. Spargelköpfe und das untere Drittel abschneiden. Die Spargelstangen dann mit einem Sparschäler oder einem scharfen Messer längs in hauchdünne Streifen schneiden.
2. Einen Topf mit ca. 700 ml Wasser mit 1 TL Salz, 1 TL Zucker und 1 TL Butter zum Kochen bringen. Spargel-Enden ins Wasser geben. Ca. 2 Minuten bei mittlerer Temperatur köcheln lassen. Die Spargelköpfe dazugeben noch mal ca. 2 Minuten köcheln lassen. Alles mit einer Schaumkelle aus dem Wasser heben und beiseitestellen. Dann den in Streifen geschnittenen Spargel in das Wasser geben und ca. 1 Minute köcheln lassen. Über einem Sieb abgießen.
3. Linguine laut Packungsanleitung al dente kochen und mit kaltem Wasser abspülen.
4. Pinienkerne in einer Pfanne ohne Öl bei mittlerer Hitze goldbraun rösten. Parmesan fein reiben. Petersilie waschen und trocken schütteln. Zitrone waschen und abtrocknen. Ca. 1 TL von der Schale abreiben, den Saft auspressen. Knoblauch schälen.
5. Die Spargel-Enden, Pinienkerne, Parmesan, Petersilie (samt Stielen), Knoblauch und etwas Wasser mit einem Mixer oder Pürierstab zu einer feinen Creme verarbeiten.
6. In einer großen Schüssel Weißweinessig, Zitronensaft, Zitronenabrieb und Olivenöl vermengen. Spargelpesto unterrühren. Mit Salz und Pfeffer abschmecken.
7. Spargelköpfe längs halbieren und zusammen mit den Spargelstreifen dazugeben. Nudeln unterheben und alles gut vermengen.

Article: Düsseldorf · Der Termin steht: Ein künstliches Gelenk soll eingesetzt oder ein Tumor entfernt werden, stationär im Krankenhaus. Was muss man vor so einem Klinikaufenthalt regeln, wissen, einpacken?
Die Aussicht auf einen Klinikaufenthalt, die ist wohl für niemanden so richtig schön. Nicht nur, weil sich vorab Ängste melden, ob der Eingriff wie geplant verläuft, ob man die Narkose gut verträgt, wie schnell man wortwörtlich wieder auf die Beine kommt. Die Gedanken kreisen vielleicht auch um Fragen wie: Habe ich an alles gedacht, muss ich noch etwas klären? Hier bekommen Sie einen Überblick:
Was muss ich vorab erledigen?
Der Termin für die Krankenhausbehandlung steht, vielleicht hat man Ihnen schon eine Prognose gegeben, wie viele Nächte Sie dort bleiben müssen. Diese Information sollten Sie weitergeben an alle, die mit Ihrer Abwesenheit planen müssen. Zum Beispiel an den Arbeitgeber, wie Verena Querling, Referentin Pflegerecht bei der Verbraucherzentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen, sagt.
Was sonst noch erledigt werden muss? „Das hängt natürlich von der jeweiligen Lebenssituation ab“, sagt Querling. Vielleicht braucht es jemanden, der die Gemüsebeete im Garten in dieser Zeit gießt, die Katze versorgt, den Briefkasten leert, die Tochter zum Turnunterricht fährt. „Am besten spannt man frühzeitig ein Netz, das dann aushelfen kann.“
Und wer springt ein, wenn man zum Beispiel den Partner oder die Mutter pflegt, das aber wegen des Krankenhausaufenthalts für eine Weile nicht kann? Dann kann die Verhinderungspflege eine Option ein. Das bedeutet: Die Pflegeversicherung trägt für Pflegebedürftige der Grade 2 bis 5 die nachgewiesenen Kosten einer Ersatzpflege. Diese Ersatzpflege kann durch einen ambulanten Pflegedienst, durch Einzelpflegekräfte, ehrenamtlich Pflegende, aber auch durch nahe Angehörige erfolgen, heißt es vom Bundesgesundheitsministerium.
Was braucht das Krankenhaus alles von mir?
Ohne Versichertenkarte und Personalausweis geht bei der Anmeldung nichts. Um im Krankenhaus aufgenommen zu werden, muss zudem eine Einweisung vorliegen („Verordnung von Krankenhausbehandlung“), die von Haus- oder Facharzt ausgestellt wird. Wer privat krankenversichert ist, sollte die Kostenzusage der Krankenkasse parat haben.
Sofern man eine Patientenverfügung oder eine Vorsorgevollmacht hat, ist es sinnvoll, auch diese mitzunehmen, rät Verena Querling. Und natürlich sollte man dafür sorgen, dass das Krankenhaus möglichst gut über den eigenen Gesundheitszustand und Besonderheiten Bescheid weiß. Vor einem geplanten Eingriff wird das im Vorgespräch abgefragt.
„Von einem Herzschrittmacher oder einer Prothese müssen die Ärzte natürlich wissen. Und auch, welche Medikamente man einnimmt“, sagt Querling. Allergiker bringen ihren Allergie-Pass mit, wer Blutverdünner einnimmt, sollte seinen Marcumar-Pass einstecken. Die meisten Krankenhäuser geben auf ihrer Webseite auch eine Checkliste, welche Dokumente genau benötigt werden.
Wichtig ist zudem, dem Krankenhaus die Kontaktdaten der Hausarztpraxis zu geben, damit Kommunikation und Austausch von Befunden reibungslos klappen können.
Was kommt ansonsten in die Tasche?
Wenn Sie vor dem Kleiderschrank stehen und überlegen, was in die Kliniktasche wandern soll, sollten Sie diesem Grundsatz folgen: „Worin man sich wohlfühlt und was bequem ist, Kleidungsstücke, in denen man auch den Gang im Krankenhaus runterlaufen würde“, sagt Verena Querling. Gerade bei frischen OP-Narben sind eher weit geschnittene Kleidungsstücke sinnvoll, da drückt nichts.
Hilfsmittel wie Hörgerät oder Brillen müssen natürlich auch mit. Hier gilt besondere Vorsicht, damit sie nicht verloren gehen, wenn man sie vor dem Eingriff ablegt. „Manchmal werden die einfach in Taschentücher gewickelt und sind dann auf einmal weg“, sagt Querling. Besser: sicher in Dose oder Etui verstauen und vorab klären, wie sie wieder den Weg zu einem finden.
Und natürlich sollte man auch Dinge einpacken, die der Langeweile im Krankenhaus etwas entgegensetzen, „ob es das Sudoku-Heft, ein Headset zum Musikhören oder ein schönes Buch ist“, sagt Querling.
Wer Serien streamen will, sollte sich vorab über die WLAN-Situation im Krankenhaus informieren. Einer Auswertung von Verivox aus dem Mai 2023 zufolge bieten 70 Prozent der größten Kliniken und Krankenhäuser in Deutschland kostenloses WLAN auf den Patientenzimmern an. Wer doch für die Internetnutzung zahlen muss, kann sich auf Kosten von etwa drei bis fünf Euro pro Tag einstellen.
Und was bleibt besser zu Hause? Wertsachen, insbesondere Schmuck. „Man muss Ringe und Co. ja ohnehin ausziehen, wenn es in den OP geht“, sagt Querling.
Was kostet mich der Krankenhausaufenthalt?
Die Zuzahlung liegt für gesetzlich Krankenversicherte ab 18 Jahren bei 10 Euro pro Tag. Wer länger als 28 Tage im Kalenderjahr stationär im Krankenhaus behandelt wird, muss ab dem 29. Tag nichts mehr zuzahlen.
Die Krankenhäuser rechnen dabei direkt mit den Patientinnen und Patienten ab, nach der Entlassung landet also eine Rechnung im Briefkasten.
Apropos Entlassung: Was muss ich dafür alles regeln?
Spätestens, wenn sich das Ende des Klinikaufenthalts abzeichnet, kommt das sogenannte Entlassmanagement des Krankenhauses ins Spiel, das meist beim sozialen Dienst liegt. Dessen Ziel ist es, den Übergang zwischen Krankenhausaufenthalt und der Zeit danach möglichst reibungslos zu gestalten.
Je frühzeitiger man Kontakt zum Entlassmanagement aufnimmt, desto besser - gerade dann, wenn man auch über die Klinikzeit hinaus Unterstützung benötigt, rät Verena Querling. Das Entlassmanagement unterstützt bei Anträgen, zum Beispiel auf einen Pflegegrad. Auch Leistungen wie häusliche Krankenpflege, eine Haushaltshilfe oder Pflegehilfsmittel wie Rollstuhl, Pflegebett oder Toilettenstuhl können aus dem Krankenhaus beantragt und organisiert werden. Und wenn man nach dem Krankenhausaufenthalt noch nicht fit genug für zu Hause ist, kann eine Kurzzeitpflege gesucht werden.
Was muss ich wissen, wenn ich mich selbst entlassen möchte?
„Dann gibt es ein Formular, auf dem man noch einmal darauf hingewiesen wird, dass die Entlassung gegen ärztlichen Rat ist“, sagt Verena Querling. Das muss man unterschreiben, wenn man sich selbst entlassen möchte. Dabei geht es um Haftungsfragen. Bleiben durch das vorzeitige Verlassen des Krankenhauses langfristige Schäden zurück, wird es schwierig, diese vor Gericht als ärztlichen Behandlungsfehler anerkennen zu lassen.
Das heißt aber nicht, dass man abgewiesen wird, wenn man doch wieder ärztliche Behandlung benötigt. „Sollte zum Beispiel eine OP-Wunde doch wieder aufgehen, wird man natürlich wieder behandelt“, sagt Verena Querling.
Kann das Krankenhaus mich krankschreiben?
Ja, das ist möglich, für bis zu sieben Tage. „Das verschafft einem ein bisschen Luft, sodass man nicht sofort zum Hausarzt muss, wenn man aus dem Krankenhaus kommt“, sagt Verena Querling.
Gut möglich, dass man sich aber doch zeitnah auf den Weg zur Arztpraxis machen muss, nämlich dann, wenn man Medikamente benötigt. Denn Krankenhäuser dürfen sie nur begrenzt mitgeben bzw. verordnen.
Wird man vor oder an einem Wochenende oder Feiertag entlassen, darf das Krankenhaus nur so viele Medikamente mitgeben, wie es zur Überbrückung dieser Tage braucht. Die Klinik kann Medikamente aber auch verordnen, sodass man sie nach der Entlassung selbst in der Apotheke abholen kann. Möglich ist dabei allerdings höchstens die kleinste Packungsgröße.

Article: Berlin · Lifehacks im Netz versprechen für fast jedes Problem eine simple Lösung. Ob der Tipp hält, was er verspricht, testen wir mit unserem Hack-Check.
Welche Ketten kommen mit in den Urlaub? Am liebsten alle. Das Problem: Lose im Kosmetiktäschchen oder Kulturbeutel verstaut, können sie sich verknoten oder ineinander verheddern. Das Entwirren kann eine Weile dauern. Also besser vorbeugen - doch was hilft gegen das Ketten-Wirrwarr?
TikTok, Instagram und Co. sind voll von Lifehacks, für fast jedes Problem gibt es eine simple Lösung, die nur wenige Handgriffe erfordert und nicht teuer sein soll. Für das Kettenchaos sollen Strohhalme die rettende Lösung sein.
Doch wir wissen, dass das Internet nicht immer die Wahrheit sagt. Deshalb haben wir den Tipp für knotenfreie Ketten in unserem Hack-Check getestet. Hält der Lifehack was er verspricht - oder ist er ein Flop?
Und so geht's: Für jede Kette braucht man einen Strohhalm - am besten aus Papier, das ist nachhaltiger. Die Kette wird durch den Strohhalm gefädelt und verschlossen - fertig. Bei kürzeren Ketten kann man den Strohhalm einfach abschneiden.
Fazit: Der Hack funktioniert ausgezeichnet. Auch wenn man viele Ketten auf einmal in eine Tasche packt, lassen sie sich dank der Strohhalme wieder leicht voneinander trennen.

Article: Frankfurt/Main/Düsseldorf · Eine Operation am Herzen ist kein kleiner Eingriff. Wer bei einer planbaren OP unsicher ist, kann sich eine zweite Meinung einholen. Wann ist sie sinnvoll und an wen kann ich mich wenden?
Klar ist: Eine Zweitmeinung kommt nur dann in Betracht, wenn keine Zeitnot besteht. Darauf weist Professor Thomas Meinertz vom Wissenschaftlichen Beirat der Deutschen Herzstiftung hin. Bei einem Herzinfarkt etwa ist schnelles Handeln gefragt.
Aber vor allem das Wie mancher Behandlung kann durchaus abgewogen werden. Ist ein chirurgischer Eingriff nötig, ist eine OP per Herzkatheter möglich oder reichen vielleicht sogar Medikamente - unterschiedliche Ärzte können das jeweils anders beurteilen.
Besonderes Verfahren für bestimmte OPs
Für bestimmte Operationen gibt es ein spezielles Zweitmeinungsverfahren. Beim Herzen ist das etwa das Einsetzen eines Schrittmachers oder eine Verödung am Herzen. In so einem Fall müssen behandelnder Arzt oder Ärztin sogar mindestens zehn Tage vor der Operation darauf hinweisen, dass eine Beratung bei einem entsprechend qualifizierten Arzt möglich ist. Das erklärt die Verbraucherzentrale NRW auf ihrer Webseite.
Diese Beratung kann man dann annehmen oder nicht. Die entsprechenden Zweitexperten müssen besonders qualifiziert und unabhängig sein und brauchen eine Genehmigung der Kassenärztlichen Vereinigung. Eine Auflistung findet sich auf der Website des ärztlichen Bereitschaftsdienstes.
Selbstständig um Zweitmeinung kümmern
Aber auch bei anderen geplanten Herz-OPs kann eine Zweitmeinung sinnvoll sein, sagt Professor Meinertz. Etwa bei einem Herzklappenersatz oder einer Bypass-Operation. Jeder Patient und jede Patientin hat das Recht, sich diese einzuholen. Aber wo? Sich selbst im Internet umzusehen, hält der Herzexperte wegen zu positiver Selbstdarstellungen für problematisch. Besser erkundige man sich der entsprechenden Krankenkasse oder Ärztekammer.
Auch der behandelnde Arzt oder die Ärztin kann jemanden empfehlen. Denn im Idealfall ist er offen für eine weitere Einschätzung. Ein No-Go sei allerdings, sagt Meinertz, dass einfach ein befreundeter Kollege angerufen werde, der voreingenommen nur die Erstmeinung bestätigen solle. Vielmehr sollte der nach einer zweiten Meinung Gefragte nicht von vornherein auf eine bestimmte Methode festgelegt sein.
Was Patienten und Patientinnen jedoch vermeiden sollten: Noch eine Dritt- oder gar Viertmeinung einzuholen. Das verunsichert laut dem Herzspezialisten am Ende nur.

Article: Von Grün bis Rot: Wie das Pkw-Label Verbrauchern helfen soll
Man kennt sie von Kühlschränken oder Waschmaschinen: Energielabel, die zeigen sollen, wie sich das Gerät auf die Umwelt auswirkt. Etwas Ähnliches gibt es auch für Pkw. Jetzt wurde es geändert.
Berlin (dpa) - Mehr Transparenz soll es bringen und damit auch zu bewussteren Kaufentscheidungen führen: Ein verändertes Pkw-Label soll ab Mittwoch potenzielle Käufer von Neuwagen unter anderem besser über den Verbrauch und die Emissionen des Fahrzeugs informieren. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, wurde bereits im Februar die Verordnung zur Energieverbrauchskennzeichnung bei Pkw angepasst.

Article: Tausende Menschen will die britische Regierung bis zum Jahresende nach Ruanda abschieben. Nun soll sich erstmals ein Mensch auf den Weg gemacht haben - freiwillig.
In wenigen Wochen sollen die ersten Abschiebeflüge nach Ruanda starten. Doch bereits vor der Umsetzung des umstrittenen Plans für Massenabschiebungen soll Großbritannien nun einen abgelehnten Asylbewerber zur Ausreise in das ostafrikanische Land bewegt haben. Dieser soll dafür eine Zahlung von Tausenden Pfunden erhalten haben, wie die Zeitung "Sun" berichtet.
Ausreise mit 3.500 Euro bezahlt
Demnach reiste der aus einem ungenannten afrikanischen Staat stammende Mann am Montag (29. April) per Linienflug nach Ruanda. Dort habe er rund 3.000 Pfund (3.500 Euro) als Startgeld aus der britischen Staatskasse erhalten. Dem Sender Sky News wurde der Bericht aus Regierungskreisen bestätigt.

Die Aktion ist nicht Teil des viel kritisierten Plans der konservativen Regierung, irregulär eingereiste Asylbewerber:innen ungeachtet ihrer Herkunft zu Tausenden nach Ruanda abzuschieben. Es handele sich laut der "Sun" dennoch um einen historischen Moment, der zeige, dass es möglich sei, Asylsuchende in einen Drittstaat abzuschieben.
Freiwillige Abschiebung sei PR-Aktion, so Opposition
Dagegen kritisierte die oppositionelle Labour-Partei, es handele sich um eine PR-Aktion im Wahlkampf.
Das britische Parlament hatte vergangene Woche nach langem Streit den Plan zur Abschiebung von Migranten nach Ruanda gebilligt. Die Abschiebeflüge nach Ruanda sollen in einigen Wochen beginnen.
Irregulär eingereiste Menschen sollen künftig ungeachtet ihrer Herkunft und ohne Prüfung ihres Asylantrags nach Ruanda abgeschoben werden können, das ostafrikanische Land wurde dafür als sicheres Drittland eingestuft. Kritiker:innen sehen im Abschiebungsplan der Regierung einen Bruch internationaler Regeln.

Article: Newswise — JACKSONVILLE, Florida — La enfermedad de Pick, una enfermedad neurodegenerativa de origen genético desconocido, es un tipo raro de demencia frontotemporal que afecta a personas menores de 65 años. La condición causa cambios en la personalidad, en el comportamiento y, a veces, compromete el lenguaje. En pacientes con la enfermedad, las proteínas Taus se acumulan y forman grupos anormales llamados cuerpos Pick, que restringen los nutrientes al cerebro y causan neurodegeneración. La única manera de diagnosticar la enfermedad es observando el tejido cerebral bajo un microscopio después de la muerte de la persona.
Investigadores de Mayo Clinic, en Florida, de la University College London, en Inglaterra, y colaboradores de todo el mundo han creado el Consorcio Internacional de la Enfermedad de Pick para estudiar la variación genética específica del gen MAPT conocido como MAPT H2 que produce la proteína Tau y actúa como un motor de la enfermedad. Ellos investigaron sobre la conexión entre el gen y el riesgo de la enfermedad, la edad de inicio y la duración de la enfermedad de Pick. Sus descubrimientos están publicados en el The Lancet Neurology.
Investigadores de Mayo Clinic han identificado las primeras mutaciones genéticas del gen MAPT en una forma conductual de demencia en 1998 y en otras alteraciones genéticas asociadas con la demencia en 2001, lo que allanó el camino para comprender los mecanismos de la enfermedad relacionados con la proteína Tau. Este nuevo estudio confirma un factor genético que proviene de la proteína Tau, vinculado específicamente a la enfermedad de Pick, que abre la puerta a un desarrollo terapéutico.
"Nuestra investigación puede tener profundas implicaciones para el desarrollo de terapias para la enfermedad de Pick y otras enfermedades neurodegenerativas relacionadas, incluida la enfermedad de Alzheimer y la parálisis supranuclear progresiva, "dice el Ph.D. Owen Ross, neurocientífico de Mayo Clinic y autor principal del artículo. El consorcio alberga una base de datos de información clínica, patológica y demográfica sobre pacientes con la enfermedad que han donado sus tejidos cerebrales a la ciencia.
Para llevar a cabo el estudio, los investigadores analizaron muestras cerebrales de 338 pacientes que tenían la enfermedad de Pick confirmada, comparándolas con muestras de sangre de 1.312 individuos neurológicamente sanos. Los pacientes que fueron diagnosticados con la enfermedad provenían de 35 bancos cerebrales y hospitales de América del Norte, Europa y Australia, entre 2020 y 2023. El Banco Cerebral de Mayo Clinic fue uno de los sitios que proporcionó la mayor cantidad de muestras para el estudio.
Al analizar el ADN de las muestras de sangre y los tejidos cerebrales, el equipo de investigación registró información básica sobre los participantes del estudio, incluida la edad que tenían al inicio de la enfermedad, la edad que tenían las personas con la enfermedad de Pick cuando murieron y el sexo y la edad del grupo de control en la extracción de sangre. La duración de la enfermedad se calculó por la diferencia entre la edad que tenían los participantes al inicio de la enfermedad de Pick y la edad que tenían cuando murieron. Además, los investigadores analizaron características clínicas como el diagnóstico clínico y el deterioro del comportamiento y del lenguaje.
"Descubrimos que la variante genética MAPT H2 se asocia con un mayor riesgo de enfermedad de Pick en personas de ascendencia europea", afirma el Dr. Ross. "Solo pudimos determinar esto debido al consorcio global que ha aumentado mucho la cantidad de muestras de casos de patología para estudios con la enfermedad de Pick."
Los siguientes pasos del equipo son ampliar el consorcio a Medio Oriente, Asia, África y Latinoamérica, así como determinar la arquitectura genética de la enfermedad y establecer esta variante genética específica como biomarcador o prueba para el diagnóstico clínico de la enfermedad de Pick. Actualmente no hay pruebas clínicas o de diagnóstico disponibles para la enfermedad de Pick. Por primera vez, la creación del consorcio puede permitir el desarrollo de un ensayo clínico.
La financiación de esta investigación en Mayo Clinic fue apoyada en parte por los Institutos Nacionales de la Salud, por el Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neurológicas y Accidentes Cerebrovasculares, por el Programa de Investigación de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer Ed y Ethel Moore del estado de Florida y por el Centro de Investigación de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer en Mayo Clinic.

Article: Hoy, 1 de mayo, el santoral de la Iglesia Católica conmemora a varios beatos y santos que han formado parte de la historia del cristianismo. Además de ser una forma de honrar a los santos y beatificados, también sirve como una guía para los católicos, que pueden encontrar inspiración en las vidas y obras de estos santos. Hoy celebramos a varios santos, los más destacados son: San Jeremías profeta y San José Obrero.
San José Obrero: Una fiesta de amor y dignidad en el trabajo
La celebración del Día del Trabajo, anteriormente era una oportunidad para manifestar descontento y reivindicaciones laborales, pero ha encontrado un nuevo significado con la institución cristiana, y se trata de la fiesta de San José Obrero por el Papa Pío XII en 1955. Este día, que antes estaba marcado por la discordia y la propaganda anti-religiosa, ahora se centra en el amor a Dios y en la responsabilidad hacia el prójimo.
En un momento histórico marcado por la industrialización y el surgimiento de grandes masas obreras, la fiesta del trabajo se había convertido en una plataforma para la lucha de clases y la difamación hacia la Iglesia. Sin embargo, con la institución de la fiesta de San José Obrero, se cambió el enfoque hacia el respeto por la dignidad del trabajo y del trabajador, así como hacia la responsabilidad social y política de todos los actores involucrados.
San José, el humilde artesano y padre adoptivo de Jesús, representa la figura del trabajador que enfrentó dificultades y carencias con dignidad y responsabilidad. Su vida refleja las experiencias comunes a muchos trabajadores, desde el cansancio físico hasta los desafíos familiares y laborales. A través de su ejemplo, la fiesta de San José Obrero nos invita a honrar a Dios santificando nuestro trabajo diario, descansar y disfrutar del regocijo que viene al compartir con los demás.
En este día, recordamos la importancia del amor al prójimo, la justicia social y la responsabilidad colectiva para construir un mundo más justo y equitativo para todos. Que la celebración de San José Obrero nos inspire a trabajar con diligencia, a cuidar unos de otros y a promover el bienestar de toda la comunidad.
San Jeremías: El profeta de la fortaleza y la esperanza
San Jeremías, un profeta hebreo nacido en Judea alrededor del año 650 a.C., es recordado por su valentía y su mensaje de arrepentimiento y esperanza en tiempos difíciles. Su vida, narrada en el Libro de Jeremías y el Libro de las Lamentaciones, dejó un legado de fe y resistencia que perdura hasta nuestros días.
Desde su juventud, Jeremías fue llamado por Dios para proclamar su palabra al pueblo de Judá y a sus líderes. A lo largo de su vida, enfrentó la hostilidad y la persecución por parte de aquellos a quienes advertía de las consecuencias de su pecado y corrupción. A pesar de los desafíos y los peligros, Jeremías mantuvo su firmeza y dedicación a su misión profética.
Una de las características más destacadas de Jeremías fue su resistencia ante la adversidad. A pesar de ser golpeado, encarcelado y abandonado, nunca renunció a su llamado divino. Su mensaje de arrepentimiento y su visión de un futuro restaurado para el pueblo de Dios resonaron a lo largo de los siglos, inspirando a generaciones posteriores a mantener la esperanza incluso en los momentos más oscuros.
También fue conocido por su compasión y su preocupación por los más vulnerables de la sociedad. Abogó por la liberación de los esclavos y denunció la opresión y la injusticia que veía a su alrededor. Su visión de una nueva alianza entre Dios y su pueblo ofreció consuelo y esperanza a aquellos que sufrían bajo el yugo de la opresión.
A pesar de las dificultades y los desafíos, nunca perdió la fe en la fidelidad y el amor de Dios. Su vida y su mensaje continúan siendo una fuente de inspiración y fortaleza para todos aquellos que enfrentan pruebas y tribulaciones en sus propias vidas.
En un mundo marcado por la incertidumbre y la adversidad, la vida de Jeremías nos recuerda la importancia de mantener la fe y la esperanza en Dios. Que su ejemplo nos inspire a perseverar en nuestra propia fe y a confiar en el poder transformador del amor divino.

Article: Por Santotomealdía
No hubo acuerdo en la paritaria municipal y la Federación de Sindicatos de Trabajadores Municipales de la Provincia de Santa Fe (FESTRAM) dispuso un paro de 48 horas. La medida de fuerza se llevará a cabo los días viernes 10 y lunes 13 de mayo, jornada en la que además habrá una movilización hacia la sede de IAPOS.
En la reunión paritaria de este martes, los representantes de intendentes y presidentes comunales realizaron una propuesta salarial inferior al 5%, respecto de los salarios conforme a la escala salarial vigente. Formalmente, el ofrecimiento consistió en un 7,25% de aumento para el mes de abril, pero tomando como referencia los sueldos de enero.
La FESTRAM rechazó el ofrecimiento, por considerarlo “totalmente ajeno a los índices inflacionarios y busca trasladar a los trabajadores el ajuste que lleva adelante el Gobierno Nacional sobre la coparticipación a Provincias y Municipios”.
“Lo ofrecido acarrea llevar a miles de trabajadores municipales y comunales a la pobreza, ya que representa para los trabajadores de menores ingresos que perciben el Salario Mínimo, una propuesta de incremento de $18.125”, agregaron.
Movilización
El lunes 13 de mayo, en la segunda jornada de paro, los trabajadores municipales se movilizarán a la sede del IAPOS, en la ciudad de Santa Fe. Según denunciaron, “pese a las gestiones frente al Gobierno provincial para conseguir la regularización de las prestaciones de la obra social IAPOS, los servicios permanecen cortados y sin acceso para la mayoría de los trabajadores de nuestro sector”.
Finalmente, recordaron que el plenario de secretarios generales resolvió adherir al Paro Nacional dispuesto para el jueves 9 de mayo, en rechazo a las políticas del Gobierno Nacional que pretenden suprimir el régimen laboral vigente. En ese marco, habrá tres días hábiles consecutivos sin actividad municipal: jueves 9, viernes 10 y lunes 13 de mayo.

Article: El Gobierno postergó los aumentos en las tarifas de luz y gas previstos para mayo. El objetivo es mantener el sendero de desaceleración en la inflación, que ya en abril volverá a ser de un dígito según estiman las consultoras privadas.
A partir del 1 de mayo, estaba estipulado que se aplique el mecanismo de indexación mensual que definió la secretaría de Energía, para evitar un atraso en términos reales contra la inflación. Pero, el Gobierno decidió no aplicar esa actualización.
El Gobierno postergó aumentos en tarifas de luz y gas
En este escenario, tanto el Enre como el Enargas no publicaron los cuadros tarifarios correspondientes al mes de mayo, luego de los fuertes aumentos aplicados durante el primer cuatrimestre, que alcanzaron el 200% en electricidad y más del 300% en gas; el agua trepó 209% y el transporte público, 410%.
En concreto, las empresas transportadoras de los servicios públicos debían comenzar a aplicar la indexación mensual en sus tarifas, que se traduciría a un aumento en las boletas que reciben los usuarios: están atadas a la evolución de los salarios, inflación y otras variables.
Es así que los aumentos de estas fórmulas iban entre el 10% y el 12,5%, lo que implicaría una suba cercana al 5% en las facturas finales que reciben los usuarios. Pero, si bien las empresas ya habían sido notificadas de cuánto sería el aumento de mayo, la decisión de aplicar o no esa suba dependía del ministro de Economía Luis Caputo. Y, finalmente, el Gobierno definió no aumentar en mayo las tarifas.
El Gobierno también debe aprobar la "programación estacional" de la Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico (Cammesa), que contiene los precios de la energía de invierno, más caros que en verano por el mayor uso de combustibles.
Las estimaciones oficiales conllevarían a una suba que representaría el 25% en los montos que pagan los usuarios, pero eso también está en revisión.
El Gobierno ya había definido postergar las subas en las tarifas a comienzos de año, para evitar un nuevo salto en la inflación. De hecho, en un principio, la quita de subsidios se aplicó a usuarios de altos ingresos, industrias y comercios.
Todos los aumentos previstos para mayo
El quinto mes del año estará marcado por la suba de la nafta, alquileres, boleto de trenes y subtes, entre otros rubros que se sumarán al índice general de precios.
Alquileres
Más allá de la derogación de la Ley de Alquileres con el mega DNU, los contratos en curso deben ser respetados hasta su fecha de vencimiento. Esto significa que mientras el acuerdo esté vigente, todos los términos y condiciones se aplicarán hasta el momento de su finalización.
En ese sentido, aquellos que alquilaron bajo la ley tendrán que afrontar subas cercanas al 200% anual en los valores a pagar. De esta manera, se anota otro récord para el Índice de Contratos de Locación (ICL), que realiza el Banco Central (BCRA) sobre la base de la inflación y los salarios.
Esta fórmula se aplica únicamente a los alquileres iniciados entre el 1 de julio de 2020 y el 17 de octubre de 2023.
Cable y celular
Las empresas comenzaron a anticipar a sus clientes que, a partir de los primeros días de mayo, llevarán a cabo un nuevo retoque de tarifas del 2024, con un incremento que rondará el 10 y el 20%, según el servicio y la operadora.
Subte
El incremento estaba pensado en tres tramos mensuales, aunque por las demoras en el proceso de consulta, habrá dos subas con 15 días diferencia.
Desde el 1 de mayo, el pasaje pasará de $125 a $574 y dos semanas después alcanzará los $667. El tercer ajuste está previsto que sea a partir del 1 de junio, cuando el costo del boleto llegará a $757.
Trenes
Desde mayo, subirá el precio de los boletos de tren en el Área Metropolitana de Buenos Aires (AMBA). El tramo mínimo, que abarca de 0 a 12 kilómetros, el pasaje aumentará de $130 a $200.
Para distancias intermedias, que comprende tramos de 12 a 24 kilómetros, el precio del boleto pasará de $169 a $260.
El último trayecto, que va más allá de los 24 kilómetros, subirá de $208 a $320

Article: El telescopio espacial James Webb (JWST) abrió una nueva era en la astronomía. Este telescopio gigante, con un espejo primario de 6,5 metros, el más potente jamás construido, nos ha permitido observar el universo con una claridad y sensibilidad sin precedentes. Pero lo más increíble de todo es que este telescopio todavía está en sus primeras etapas de operación.
PUBLICIDAD
Aún así, ya revolucionó nuestra comprensión del universo. Apoyado de misiones espaciales, los investigadores han logrado descifrar algunos de los misterios más enigmáticos del cosmos gracias al James Webb.
De hecho, ahora un nuevo hallazgo intriga a la comunidad científica: un grupo de astrónomos ha detectado lo que podría ser el primer indicio químico de la presencia de estrellas masivas en protocúmulos globulares, formados apenas 440 millones de años después del Big Bang.

Los cúmulos globulares son agrupaciones densas de estrellas que se distribuyen en forma esférica, con radios que varían entre una docena y 100 años luz. Estas estructuras, que albergan millones de estrellas, se encuentran en todo tipo de galaxias. Un estudio publicado en la revista Astronomy & Astrophysics revela que la composición química de las estrellas que nacen en un mismo cúmulo globulal presenta anomalías que no se observan en ningún otro tipo de población estelar.
Un equipo de las universidades de Ginebra y Barcelona, junto al Instituto de Astrofísica de París (CNRS y Universidad de la Sorbona), ha propuesto una teoría audaz: la presencia de estrellas masivas en los protocúmulos globulares.
Monstruos celestiales que habitaron el universo primitivo
Las observaciones realizadas con el Telescopio Espacial James Webb han sido cruciales para identificar estos protocúmulos globulares. Su potente visión infrarroja permitió captar la luz emitida por GN-z11, una de las galaxias más lejanas del universo, ubicada a 13.300 millones de años luz. El análisis del espectro de luz emitido por GN-z11 brindó información fundamental para la investigación.
La composición de las estrellas en los protocúmulos globulares ha desconcertado a los científicos. Se ha observado que la proporción de elementos como oxígeno, nitrógeno, sodio y aluminio varía de una estrella a otra, a pesar de haber nacido al mismo tiempo y en la misma nube de gas. Estas diferencias han sido denominadas “anomalías de abundancia”.
En 2018, el equipo de investigación desarrolló un modelo teórico que sugiere que las estrellas masivas contaminaron la nube de gas original durante la formación de los cúmulos, provocando una distribución heterogénea de elementos químicos en las estrellas que se formaron posteriormente.
“Hoy, gracias a los datos recopilados por el Telescopio Espacial James Webb, creemos haber encontrado una primera pista de la presencia de estas extraordinarias estrellas”, comenta Corinne Charbonnel, profesora titular del Departamento de Astronomía de la UNIGE y primera autora del estudio.
Verdaderos “gigantes cósmicos” en un espacio, de por si, gigante
Estas estrellas, también llamadas “monstruos celestiales”, son de 5.000 a 10.000 veces más masivas que el Sol y su temperatura central alcanza los 75 millones de grados Celsius, cinco veces superior a la del Sol.
A pesar de su enorme tamaño y luminosidad, las estrellas masivas tienen una vida útil muy corta, de apenas dos millones de años. En comparación, los cúmulos globulares tienen una edad estimada de entre 10.000 y 13.000 millones de años. Por lo tanto, estas estrellas masivas desaparecieron hace mucho tiempo de los cúmulos que podemos observar hoy en día, dejando solo rastros indirectos de su existencia.
El estudio ha detectado niveles muy elevados de nitrógeno en estas estrellas, así como una densidad estelar excepcionalmente alta. La presencia de nitrógeno en grandes cantidades solo puede explicarse por la combustión de hidrógeno a temperaturas extremadamente altas, algo que solo ocurre en el núcleo de las estrellas masivas, como lo confirman los modelos desarrollados por Laura Ramírez-Galeano, estudiante de maestría del equipo de investigación.
Este nuevo descubrimiento abre un capítulo fascinante en la comprensión de la formación y evolución de las galaxias en el universo primitivo. La detección de estas estrellas masivas en protocúmulos globulares nos acerca a desentrañar los misterios de la formación estelar en las primeras etapas del cosmos.

Article: 1. ¿Qué es exactamente la miocardiopatía hipertrófica?
Es una enfermedad del músculo del corazón. Los que la padecen tienen una mayor masa muscular, lo que ocasiona diferentes problemas en el corazón y, en algunos casos, síntomas invalidantes y una limitación importante de la calidad de vida y capacidad funcional. Además, tienen un riesgo aumentado de padecer una muerte súbita por arritmias.
2. ¿Cuál es el nivel de prevalencia en España?
Se estima que la prevalencia es de alrededor de 1 cada 500 personas. No es una enfermedad demasiado infrecuente.
3. ¿A qué se debe?
Está determinada genéticamente y esta alteración genética codifica unas proteínas que forman parte del músculo cardíaco que tienen alterada su función. Como consecuencia, el músculo aumenta de tamaño. El resultado va desde una cavidad cardíaca de menor tamaño, obstrucción al flujo de sangre en el corazón, alteraciones valvulares, demasiadas necesidades de consumo de oxígeno para un aporte coronario normal, desarrollo de fibrosis o pequeñas cicatrices en el corazón, etcétera.
4. Aunque es congénita, ¿puede estar latente sin síntomas durante mucho tiempo o se detecta en las ecos antes de que el bebé nazca?
Las personas que la padecen son portadoras de la alteración genética desde el nacimiento, pero la enfermedad raramente se manifiesta en los niños. Suele comenzar a expresarse durante la adolescencia o más tarde en edades medias de la vida.
5. ¿Qué tratamiento tiene?
Lo primero que hay que hacer es dar algunas recomendaciones referentes al estilo de vida. Por ejemplo, se desaconseja realizar deportes de alta intensidad o competitivos, ya que aumentan el riesgo de muerte súbita arrítmica. Hay diferentes tratamientos farmacológicos y también intervenciones de cirugía cardíaca para diferentes manifestaciones de la enfermedad.
6. ¿Qué porcentaje de pacientes con esta enfermedad sufren una muerte súbita?
El riesgo de muerte súbita en esta enfermedad no es homogéneo y depende de cómo se manifieste en cada paciente. Existen datos que permiten estimar el riesgo de muerte súbita en base a algunas características determinadas que no son difíciles de obtener con pruebas como una ecografía cardíaca, un Holter, el interrogatorio del paciente o una resonancia magnética cardíaca.
7. Usted lidera una investigación publicada en la revista oficial de la Sociedad Europea de Arritmias que demuestra que se puede llegar a minimizar el riesgo de muerte súbita en los pacientes que padecen miocardiopatía hipertrófica. ¿Cómo?
El estudio, realizado en pacientes con miocardiopatía hipertrófica, muestra cómo en aquellos en los que se identifican cicatrices con lo que llamamos canales (o cortocircuitos eléctricos) en su interior, tienen una mayor capacidad para poder tener un tipo de arritmias cardíacas que podrían iniciar una cascada de eventos que terminarían en la arritmia final que produce la muerte súbita en estos pacientes.
8. ¿La detección de cicatrices en qué medida ayudará a seleccionar mejor el tratamiento para minimizar el riesgo de muerte súbita?
La detección de estas cicatrices se puede realizar con una resonancia magnética cardíaca y el grado en el que esto ayude a proteger a los pacientes mediante la implantación de un desfibrilador es algo que está por determinar con futuros estudios, uno de los cuales ya está en marcha, aunque aún no tenemos resultados.
9. ¿En qué se diferencia la fibrosis del tejido cicatrizado? ¿Y por qué aparecen las cicatrices?
La fibrosis puede ser difusa pero también se puede acumular en algunas zonas determinadas y, cuando se acumula, forma las cicatrices, que se puede identificar de forma más clara. Estas cicatrices pueden tener las características que nos indican una mayor capacidad de generar arritmias, que podrían ser letales.
10. ¿Cuáles son los siguientes objetivos de investigación?
El siguiente objetivo es realizar un estudio con un mayor número de pacientes en el que se pueda establecer una relación clara entre la presencia de estas cicatrices con una mayor capacidad aparente de generar arritmias y el evento clínico. Para ello estamos coordinando un estudio multicéntrico internacional en el que esperamos incluir más de 400 pacientes con esta enfermedad y que disponen de una resonancia magnética cardíaca.

El oficialismo de la Cámara de Diputados logró este martes que se aprobara, como parte del paquete fiscal, la restitución del impuesto a las Ganancias para la cuarta categoría, en el marco de una discusión que se trasladará al Senado para su efectiva implementación.
Si la medida quedara en pie tras la ratificación de la Cámara alta, casi un millón de trabajadores volvería a pagar este tributo, renombrado “impuesto a los ingresos personales” en la Ley de Medidas Fiscales, Paliativas y Relevantes.
Este quinto título de la iniciativa fiscal se aprobó con 132 votos positivos, 113 negativos y siete abstenciones durante la sesión especial que se desarrolla desde ayer al mediodía en el recinto de la Cámara baja.
Con las modificaciones propuestas, estarán alcanzados los trabajadores solteros que ganen más de 1.800.000 pesos y los trabajadores casados con hijos que perciban más de 2.200.000 pesos.
Antes de que el presidente de la Cámara de Diputados, Martín Menem, habilitara la votación nominal, hubo una ronda de discursos para argumentar a favor o en contra.
Sergio Palazzo (Unión por la Patria) denunció que los diputados que pensaban acompañar esta medida se encaminaban a “dejar de lado la ética de las convicciones para que 1 millón y 100 mil trabajadores vuelvan a pagar el impuesto a las Ganancias”.
Seguidamente, Romina del Plá (Frente de Izquierda) pidió que “este capítulo de restablecimiento del impuesto sobre el salario debe ser retirado de forma completa”.
La referente del Partido Obrero advirtió que por ejemplo trabajadores de la salud que hacen guardias extras para completar ingresos van a quedar alcanzados por este tributo, también recordó que la propuesta contenida en la Ley Fiscal elimina de cuajo todas las deducciones especiales.
Para la legisladora trotskista, el impuesto a las Ganancias supone una “confiscación” ya que implica “quedarse con una parte del salario que tiene carácter alimentario”.
“Todo trabajador marche preso. Todo trabajador a pagar este impuesto ignominioso”, se quejó del Plá, quien usó el final de su alocución para hablarle directamente a los sujetos afectados.
“Les están volviendo a meter la mano en el bolsillo y esto merece ser enfrentado con una huelga general para derrotar la política de este gobierno y sus colaboradores”, cerró.
Por su parte, la radical Danya Tavela apoyó la reversión de Ganancias y reclamó a las fuerzas políticas que el año pasado votaron por su eliminación que se “hagan cargo de haber desfinanciado a las provincias" por “pura demagogia electoral”.
Omitió decir que el propio presidente Javier Milei y la vicepresidenta Victoria Villarruel habían acompañado la eliminación de la cuarta categoría del impuesto a las Ganancias.
“El impuesto a las Ganancias es un impuesto correcto. Este proyecto tiene mejoras importantes. Tengo que insistir en la necesidad de restituir algunas deducciones, como falseos de caja, horas extra, guardias médicas, y los gastos en los que se incurren en materiales educativos”, dijo Tavela antes de que se votara.

Article: Tras el debate de la Ley de Bases en la Cámara de Diputados, que este martes se aprobó en general con 142 votos afirmativos, es relevante analizar las recientes declaraciones del ministro de Economía, Luis Caputo, para empezar a evaluar cómo será el nuevo marco económico posterior a la vigencia de esa normativa en el caso que se apruebe también en el Senado de la Nación.
En la presentación organizada ayer por la Fundación Mediterránea en la Bolsa de Comercio, Caputo fue consultado sobre la devaluación del peso con un crawling peg del 2% mensual. "No va a pasar un tipo de cambio real alto, olvidense", manifestó el ministro enfáticamente.
En ese aspecto el titular de la cartera económica explicó que, traído a precios de hoy, el tipo de cambio real de normalidad, como el de la convertibilidad, es de $550 en el contado con liquidación. "Hoy está el doble", dijo. Luego, sostuvo que las anclas monetaria, fiscal y cambiaria no se negocian y son los pilares del programa económico junto al equilibrio fiscal.
Qué pasará con las reservas y el cepo al dólar: la postura de Caputo
Además, el expresidente del BCRA advirtió que no espera que las reservas internacionales sigan mejorando al ritmo del primer trimestre del año. "La velocidad también nos sorprendió a nosotros", explicó, y lo atribuyó a que, "hay factores especulativos de productores y exportadores del campo que nosotros no controlamos" dijo.
El ministro también confirmó que el Gobierno está en conversaciones con el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) para diseñar un nuevo programa monetario y cambiario, pero que los buenos resultados que viene teniendo le juega en contra.
En relación a la salida del cepo cambiario manifestó que se podría hacer, pero que no va a correr ese riesgo, porque no hay certeza que de que no genere ningún sofocón. "Prefiero ir con los pies sobre la tierra", dijo al respecto.
Al referirse al descenso de la inflación en los últimos meses respecto del pico del 25,5% en diciembre, explicó que "la inflación núcleo de abril va a sorprender y en mayo seguirá bajando y esto será así, debido a que no hay razón macroeconómica para que siga habiendo inflación".
Además agregó la desaceleración de la suba de precios se debe "a la huida del peso en los últimos años", y detalló: "Hoy hubo una contracción de la base monetaria del 33%. Ese sobrante de pesos ya no está, la expectativa económica cambió notablemente y ya no hay esa necesidad de huir del peso y convalidarcualquier precio y ya empezamos a ver una recuperación del salario real. El salario privado registrado subió en febrero 14,1% versus una inflación de 13,2%"
El ministro afirmó que "en general estos indicadores suelen ser una señal de una recuperación. Pasamos de una situación de crisis a tener equilibrio fiscal, superávit comercial y superávit de cuenta corriente".
Al hablarle a los empresarios les dijo que "si apoyan este cambio no solo con el voto, sino con las acciones e invierten, la economía va a crecer, si la economía crece vamos a recaudar más, si recaudamos más vamos a tener superávit y a bajar los impuestos".
Caputo defendió el proyecto de ley de Bases
En relación a la Ley de Bases, el ministro manifestó que lo más importante en este momento es garantizar esta estabilidad. La sorpresa no son los resultados, la sorpresa es que Argentina haya hecho lo que hay que hacer.
"La ley de Bases no compromete en nada nuestra decisión de equilibrio fiscal y es importante que la ley pase porque es necesaria para todos los argentinos y muestra un soporte político que miran tanto el empresariado como los inversores internacionales", destacó Caputo.
El economista recibido en la UBA también se refirió a lo que viene para reactivar la economía, en particular al futuro de los créditos hipotecarios UVA lanzados por el Banco Hipotecario y el Banco Ciudad.
"Los créditos hipotecarios para este equipo económico son un motor fundamental de la economía. Ya que estén volviendo a estas tasas y a este nivel de inflación créditos hipotecarios a 20 y 30 años es espectacular, si pensamos dónde estábamos hace cuatro meses", manifestó al respecto.
Y agregó: "Estamos en un excelente momento para que haya una recuperación rápida, siempre y cuando podamos convencer a los agentes económicos que la estabilidad vino para quedarse y que no nos vamos a desviar del camino".
En relación al blanqueo incluido en la Ley de Bases destacó que "es importante que este tenga la aceptación de la gente porque lo importante, para nosotros y para esta recuperación, es que la economía se remonetice, tanto en pesos como en dólares, por eso nosotros hablamos de competencia de monedas".
Lo que deja en evidencia Caputo es que por ahora el Gobierno no devaluará muy fuerte el peso frente al dólar y que hay desarbitrajes de tasas o se viene una gran deflación. Al parecer el dólar estará planchado en los próximos meses y la inflación irá bajando.
El especialista Salvador Di Stefano sostiene que "el ministro de economía ha ratificado que seguirá con su política de resultado fiscal positivo, y ha puesto proa a la competencia de monedas, con una economía que necesita remonetizarse".
Según el especialista, el Gobierno parece jugado a bajar la inflación y por ende acomodar a la baja la tasa de interés. En ese aspecto, hay que destacar que la tasa implícita del dólar futuro se ubica en el 51,2% anual, alineándose con la tasa de plazo fijo que ofrecen los bancos. Algunas entidades financieras, para plazos superiores a 90 días, ofrecen tasas inferiores al 50% anual.
Pero más allá de las declaraciones de Caputo, hay que mencionar que abril refleja una caída de actividad económica que podría ser superior a la vista en el mes de marzo, el empleo formal viene cayendo y el informal aumentando, pero en menor proporción, daría la impresión que el desempleo pasaría a ser en breve la mayor preocupación de los argentinos.
La caída del consumo público arrastra al consumo privado
Las exportaciones no han repuntado, los exportadores no desean liquidar sus productos con un dólar tan bajo, y precios internacionales por el piso. La importación está disminuyendo en un escenario económico de baja actividad.
Por otro lado, el BCRA desde el 7 de diciembre del 2023 a la fecha mostró una suba de reservas del 41,6%, hay que tener en cuenta que realizará un pago al FMI, que la volverá a colocar por debajo de la barrera psicológica de los u$s30.000 millones.
En mayo, el ingreso de la cosecha de soja y maíz debería empujar fuertemente a la suba a las reservas; problemas de recolección de cultivos ligados al clima y logística han demorado la llegada de mercadería a puerto, recién a fines de mayo sabremos si hay voluntad del agricultor de retener mercadería o vender.
En breve debería comenzar la siembra de trigo, en donde los números han comenzado a cerrar, sin embargo, podría caer un 5% la superficie a sembrar, según datos de la Bolsa de Comercio de Rosario.
En cuanto al pasivo del Banco Central, la circulación monetaria creció el 30,5%, mientras que la inflación medida en igual período podría ubicarse en torno del 100% (no tenemos la inflación de abril aún), el dólar mayorista en igual período aumentó el 139,6%.
En términos reales la cantidad de moneda cayó fuertemente, y si la medimos en dólares mucho más. La circulación monetaria medida en dólares al 7 de diciembre era de u$s18.001 millones, en la actualidad es de u$s9.805 millones.
La menor cantidad de billetes ayudó a la caída de los dólares alternativos: el dólar MEP pasó de $986 a $1.016 que representa una suba del 3,0%. Claramente el que apostó por el dólar perdió, y esto genera un efecto pobreza en la población que se estima un stock de dólares cercano a los u$s200.000 millones, de los cuales unos u$s80.000 millones conviven en un mercado informal.

Article: Duolingo, la plataforma líder mundial en educación de idiomas, realizó un estudio en el que evaluó la competencia lectora y auditiva de los aprendices de su plataforma que habían completado las primeras cinco secciones de contenido del curso de español o francés (desde la interfaz de usuario en inglés). Esto, en la plataforma, y se analizaron y compararon sus puntuaciones con las de estudiantes universitarios estadounidenses de quinto semestre de universidad.
PUBLICIDAD
Los participantes eran aprendices que tenían poca o ninguna competencia previa en la lengua que querían aprender y utilizaban Duolingo como única herramienta de aprendizaje. Participaron del estudio 208 aprendices de español y 132 aprendices de francés en la plataforma.
Estudiar a través de una app: nivel universitario
En concreto, el estudio investigó: 1) el nivel de competencia en lectura y comprensión auditiva que alcanzaron los aprendices de Duolingo al completar las primeras cinco secciones del curso de español o francés 2) cuánto tiempo pasaron los aprendices usando la plataforma y 3) cómo se comparan las puntuaciones de competencia lectora y auditiva de los usuarios con las de los estudiantes que toman clases de idiomas en la universidad.

Los participantes en el estudio alcanzaron un nivel Intermedio Medio / Alto en comprensión lectora e Intermedio Bajo en comprensión auditiva en las pruebas de competencia ACTFL (pruebas estandarizadas para la evaluación global de la capacidad de lectura y comprensión oral). Al final del estudio, sus puntajes en lectura y comprensión auditiva fueron comparables a los de estudiantes universitarios de quinto semestre que fueron evaluados en las mismas pruebas en otra investigación de Tschirner (2016).
En general, los estudiantes dedicaron una mediana de 203 horas a las cinco primeras secciones del curso, los participantes españoles una mediana de 227 horas y los participantes franceses una mediana de 171 horas.
“Es importante destacar que la comprensión auditiva suele ser más difícil que la comprensión lectora para los aprendices de segundas lenguas e implica más tiempo en desarrollarse ya que en las primeras etapas de aprendizaje de idiomas, la comprensión auditiva representa un mayor nivel de atención, ejerce una carga más pesada sobre la memoria y requiere la capacidad de decodificación y procesamiento rápido. Lo contrario ocurre con la lectura, cuyo proceso se ve facilitado por la disponibilidad de texto presentado visualmente.”, aclara Xiangying Jiang, Lead Learning Scientist de Duolingo Efficacy Research Lab.

Article: La Cámara de Diputados aprobó hoy la Ley de Medidas Fiscales, Paliativas y Relevantes, que incluyó, entre otros puntos, la reposición de la cuarta categoría del impuesto a las Ganancias y el blanqueo de capitales.
Con 140 votos positivos, 103 negativos y 6 abstenciones, el Gobierno consiguió su media sanción y ahora el debate se traslada al Senado.
Este proyecto comprende, entre otros puntos clave, la reversión del impuesto a las Ganancias, rebaja de Bienes Personales, moratoria tributaria, aduanera y de Seguridad Social, blanqueo de capitales, cambios en el régimen simplificado (incluye la eliminación del monotributo social), eliminación del Impuesto a la Transferencia de Inmuebles de Personas Físicas y Sucesiones Indivisas (ITI) y creación del Régimen de Transparencia Fiscal al Consumidor.
Blanqueo de capitales: qué cambios propone el proyecto de ley de Bases
Los miembros de la cámara baja le dieron media sanción a este aspecto del paquete fiscal, denominado "capítulo de regularización de activos", más conocido como "blanqueo de capitales". Esta serie de artículos, contemplados en el proyecto de Medidas Fiscales Paliativas y Relevantes, se decidió aprobar luego de 131 votos afirmativos, 117 negativos y cuatro abstenciones.
Entre las propuestas de este nuevo programa, diseñado por Luis Caputo y compañía, se menciona que no habrá límite máximo para blanquear sin tener que pagar multas, siempre y cuando el dinero que ingrese al sistema financiero no salga hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2025. En otras palabras, un contribuyente podrá regularizar más de u$s10 millones sin pagar ninguna retención, sólo si mantiene esos fondos en una cuenta bancaria o en una actividad productiva.
En este sentido, si el contribuyente retira el dinero antes del 1° de enero de 2026, deberá abonar alícuotas del 5%, 10% o 15% sobre la base imponible que exceda los u$s100.000. Se diseñaron tres etapas de ingreso al blanqueo, de manera que mientras más tarde se ingrese, mayor será la alícuota que deberá pagarse:
- Primera etapa: desde el día siguiente a la entrada en vigencia de la respectiva reglamentación dictada por la AFIP hasta el 30 de noviembre próximo.
- Segunda etapa: desde el 1° de octubre al 31 de diciembre para pagar un adelanto de la alícuota (habrá tiempo para regularizar el restante antes del 30 de abril de 2025, si quitará el dinero del sistema financiero antes de enero de 2026).
- Tercera etapa: será entre el 1° de enero y el 31 de marzo de 2025, y la fecha límite de la presentación de la declaración jurada y del pago del impuesto de regularización será de 30 de abril del próximo año.
Por otra parte, se podrán regularizar hasta u$s100.000 en efectivo, inmuebles o criptomonedas y dejarlo fuera del sistema financiero sin pagar impuestos.
En el artículo 28 se enumera cuáles son los activos que se deben regularizar, en caso de no haber sido declarados anteriormente. Todos los bienes, de forma excepcional, deben ser valuados en dólares estadounidenses (tomando el tipo de cambio que fije mediante reglamentación el Poder Ejecutivo nacional).
En el caso de tratarse bienes en Argentina, se deben declarar:
- Dinero en efectivo, ya sea en pesos o en dólares.
- Inmuebles. Se debe considerar su valor de adquisición, su valor fiscal o su valor mínimo (el que sea superior).
- Acciones, cuotas y participación en sociedades, derechos de beneficiarios de fideicomisos o cuotapartes de fondos comunes de inversión.
- Títulos valores, incluyendo, sin limitación, a acciones, bonos, obligaciones negociables, certificados de depósito en custodia, cuotas partes de fondos y otros similares, que coticen en bolsas o mercados regulados por la Comisión Nacional de Valores.
- Créditos de cualquier tipo o naturaleza.
- Derechos y otros bienes intangibles no incluidos en incisos anteriores
- En caso de tratarse de bienes en el exterior, debe declararse:
- Dinero en efectivo o depositado en cuentas bancarias.
- Inmuebles
- Acciones, cuotas y cualquier tipo de derecho de participación en sociedades, corporaciones, entes o vehículos de cualquier naturaleza y los derechos de beneficiarios de fideicomisos u otros tipos de patrimonios de afectación similares.
- Títulos valores, incluyendo, sin limitación, a acciones, bonos, obligaciones negociables, certificados de depósito en custodia, cuotas partes de fondos y otros similares, que coticen en bolsas o mercados del exterior.
- Otros bienes muebles de cualquier tipo ubicados fuera de Argentina.
- Créditos de cualquier tipo o naturaleza, cuando el deudor de dichos créditos no sea un residente argentino bajo las normas de la Ley del Impuesto a las Ganancias.
- Derechos y otros bienes intangibles no incluidos en incisos anteriores.
- Criptomonedas, criptoactivos y otros bienes similares, sin importar quien ha sido su emisor, quien es su titular o donde estuvieran depositadas, custodiadas o guardadas.
No podrán ser objeto del Régimen de Regularización de Activos las tenencias de moneda o títulos valores en el exterior que al 31 de diciembre de 2023 estuvieran depositadas en entidades financieras o agentes de custodia radicados o ubicados en jurisdicciones o países identificados por el Grupo de Acción Financiera (GAFI) como de Alto Riesgo ("Lista Negra") o Bajo Monitoreo Intensificado ("Lista Gris") o (ii) que estando en efectivo, se encuentren físicamente ubicadas en jurisdicciones o países identificados por el Grupo de Acción Financiera (GAFI) como de Alto Riesgo ("Lista Negra") o Bajo Monitoreo Intensificado ("Lista Gris").
Además de los residentes argentinos, podrán participar del blanqueo las personas humanas no residentes que fueron residentes fiscales argentinos. "Las personas humanas que hubieran sido residentes fiscales en Argentina antes del 31 de diciembre de 2023 y que, a dicha fecha, hubieran perdido tal condición de acuerdo a las normas de la Ley del Impuesto a las Ganancias, texto ordenado en 2019 y sus modificaciones, podrán adherir al presente Régimen de Regularización de Activos como si fueran sujetos residentes en Argentina, en igualdad de derechos y obligaciones que los sujetos residentes. De ejercerse esta opción, se considerará que estos sujetos han adquirido nuevamente la residencia tributaria en el país", aclara el proyecto.

Si bien el aprendizaje puede ser muy diferente según la etapa de la vida, siempre se requiere de un esfuerzo constante durante un largo período de tiempo, y estudiar un nuevo concepto en pequeñas dosis cada día es más efectivo que estudiar mucho en un lapso corto, ya que ayuda a recordar mejor lo aprendido y le permite al cerebro consolidar el conocimiento. Y este principio no necesariamente distingue entre edades. De hecho, se ha demostrado que los adultos mayores que estudian un nuevo idioma pueden mejorar su salud cognitiva y existe evidencia de que nunca se olvida un idioma después de haberlo aprendido.
Aprender jugando
Procurando que el aprendizaje sea apto para todas las edades, Duolingo, la plataforma educativa líder en el mundo de los idiomas, emplea un modelo de gamificación para lograr que las lecciones se sientan como un juego. Aprender un idioma lleva tiempo y dedicación, y a veces puede sentirse algo abrumador. Por eso, la multiplataforma utiliza este sistema para ayudar a sus usuarios a desarrollar hábitos de aprendizaje a largo plazo y para que se diviertan. En la app, hay un balance entre los desafiantes y extensos cursos y la diversión e interacción.

“Uno de los mayores éxitos al momento de enfrentar el constante desafío de combinar aprendizaje e interacción fue introducir los niveles de las unidades. La mecánica de niveles de los videojuegos nos permitió incrementar de forma significativa el valor de aprendizaje de nuestros cursos al mismo tiempo que aumentó la interacción”, afirma Kim de Anda, Regional Marketing Manager de Duolingo para MEX & LATAM.
La evaluación e iteración hacen que todas las personas puedan aprender con Duolingo y disfrutarlo mientras lo hacen, sin importar la edad que tengan: “hemos evidenciado que entre más edad tenga el usuario, más extensa es la racha. Es mayor el número de adultos mayores con rachas de más de 365 días. Cerca del 30 % de los usuarios mayores de 60 años tienen rachas extensas, mientras que solo el 5% de los usuarios entre 13 y 17 años tienen una racha de más de un año”, agregó.

Article: El Gobierno no aplicará la actualización del Impuesto a los Combustibles Líquidos, por lo que las naftas no aumentarán como estaba previsto a partir del 1 de mayo. De esta manera, se suma a la decisión de no aplicar la indexación prevista para el quinto mes del año en las tarifas de gas y electricidad.
Sólo por el peso del Impuesto a los Combustibles, las naftas debían aumentar en mayo un 7%. Pero, a partir de la decisión del Gobierno, no habrá subas por este concepto.
Combustibles: el Gobierno frena un aumento en las naftas
"El Poder Ejecutivo Nacional publicará un Decreto en el Boletín Oficial, a través del cual se diferirá la fecha en la que tendrá efecto la actualización correspondiente al Impuesto a los Combustibles. La medida implica que no habrá incremento alguno por dicho concepto en el mes de mayo", señaló el Gobierno mediante un comunicado.
Y detalló: "En este sentido, a partir de la norma que se publicará en el Boletín Oficial, el Gobierno Nacional definió diferir la actualización correspondiente al cuarto trimestre de 2023 de los Impuestos sobre los Combustibles y al Dióxido de Carbono para la nafta sin plomo, la nafta virgen y el gasoil, al 1° de junio de 2024".
"De esta manera, la medida garantiza previsibilidad al sector y establece que no habrá incremento alguno, por dichos conceptos, en el mes de mayo", resaltó el texto.
De todas formas, las empresas petroleras podrían aplicar un incremento en relación a la devaluación del tipo de cambio oficial que fue, nuevamente, del 2% en abril.
Con esta medida, el Gobierno busca mantener el camino descendente de la inflación, que ya para abril volverá a ser de un dígito.
Cuánto aumentaron las naftas en la era Milei
El Gobierno aplicó un ajuste del 4,3% a principios de abril. El último incremento promovido llevó el precio de la nafta súper a un estimado de $834 el litro en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires. Ya en el conurbano la unidad se ubicó un 10% más cara. Por su parte, el combustible premium aceleró hasta acercarse a los $1.029 la unidad, y por el lado del gasoil la suba de la cotización elevó el precio hasta alcanzar los $880 el litro.
Vale señalar que, previo al arribo de Milei a la Presidencia, la nafta cotizaba a razón de los $404 el litro. De acuerdo a datos de entidades de la comercialización con operaciones en el centro y el este del país, en lo que va de la gestión de La Libertad Avanza (LLA), los combustibles presentan un aumento acumulado del orden del 106 por ciento.
Los incrementos sucesivos que viene aplicando el Gobierno vienen complicando fuerte los ingresos de las estaciones de servicio.
Por mencionar un ejemplo, la disparada de los valores de las naftas generó una merma en la comercialización del orden del 7,3% interanual durante el mes de febrero, según el sitio especializado Surtidores.
Respecto de esta baja, la caída se sintió especialmente en los productos premium, que en el caso de la nafta fue de casi el 23% y en el gasoil, del 8,25%. De acuerdo al portal en cuestión, se trata de la baja más pronunciada desde 2019, pese a que en ese entonces el parque automotor era mucho más reducido.

Así, la herramienta “Speaking Practice” se distingue por permitir a los usuarios interactuar en conversaciones simuladas, con el fin de mejorar su fluidez y comprensión del inglés de forma más natural y efectiva. Además destaca por incluir una retroalimentación inmediata sobre la precisión y claridad de las respuestas.
Para acceder a “Speaking Practice”, los usuarios deben formar parte del programa Search Labs de Google, disponible sólo a través de cuentas personales y no de Google Workspace, donde es posible participar en los experimentos de IA activando la función a través de la aplicación de Google o visitando el sitio web de Google Labs. Para quienes entren a este programa, una vez dentro, se les presentará un tema de conversación y se les invitará a responder utilizando palabras clave específicas.
Actualmente “Speaking Practice” se está probando en países como Argentina, Colombia, India, Indonesia, México y Venezuela. Próximamente Google expandirá su disponibilidad, lo que dependerá de los avances de esta IA. Eso sí, cabe destacar que por ahora los usuarios del programa Search Labs que prueben esta herramienta lo podrán hacer de forma gratuita, ya veremos cómo avanza esto cuando se lance oficialmente.

Article: La Ley de Bases que el presidente Javier Milei impulsó por segunda vez en la Cámara de Diputados, esta vez con una reforma laboral incluida, se aprobó tras 24 horas de debate ininterrumpido y una ardua negociación entre el Gobierno y los bloques dialoguistas que, sin embargo, ahora deberá replicarse en el Senado en medio de la urgencia del oficialismo por aprobar esta norma antes del 25 de mayo.
El proyecto insignia de Milei tuvo media sanción con 144 votos a favor, 106 en contra y 5 abstenciones del sector díscolo del bloque UCR y parte de la Coalición Cívica. Si bien confiaba en este resultado, el Gobierno envió funcionarios durante las dos jornadas de debate a la Cámara de Diputados para seguir de cerca el tratamiento y sobre todo el "poroteo" de votos sobre cada artículo del proyecto.
El ministro del Interior, Guillermo Francos, y el vicejefe de Gabinete, José Rolandi, la secretaria general de Presidencia, Karina Milei, y su mano derecha Eduardo "Lule" Menem, monitorearon este tramo decisivo del debate, que fue el que hizo naufragar la primera versión de la Ley Bases y que, en esta ocasión, mantenía en duda temas clave como la delegación de facultades al Presidente para disolver organismos públicos y el régimen especial para grandes inversiones (RIGI).
Finalmente, el oficialismo logró sortear con éxito esta prueba de fuego y mantener en pie esos puntos centrales, así como el capítulo sobre "modernización laboral" y los cambios en el empleo público. La clave para ello fue el acuerdo que selló el oficialismo con el PRO, la UCR y Hacemos Coalición Federal para que la votación se hiciera por capítulos y no artículo por artículo.
Esa mecánica generó fuertes cruces con la bancada kirchnerista, el Frente de Izquierda e incluso algunos diputados de los bloques dialoguistas, pero con el respaldo que tenía por parte de los aliados Martín Menem logró el objetivo de mantener bajo control el tramo más complejo y decisivo del debate y evitar que cayeran artículos centrales para el Gobierno por falta de votos.
¿Qué hará el Senado con la Ley Bases?: la cuenta regresiva para el Pacto de Mayo
La Ley Bases pasará junto con el proyecto de Medidas Fiscales que incluye la restitución del Impuesto a las Ganancias al Senado. Allí la posibilidad del oficialismo de bloquear modificaciones sensibles como logró en Diputados -donde la única excepción fue la incorporación del discutido impuesto al tabaco- es mucho menor.
Con 33 senadores de Unión por la Patria sobre el total de 72, nadie descarta por estas horas en el Congreso que, en el mejor de los casos, el proyecto sufra cambios que lo obligarían a volver a la Cámara de Diputados en segunda revisión. Este sería un escenario mejor que el rehazo llano de la iniciativa, pero los tiempos apremian para el Gobierno.
Con el 25 de mayo como fecha para la firma del nuevo "pacto" de gobernabilidad que propuso Milei a gobernadores y dirigentes de todos los partidos políticos, el brazo político del Gobierno a aspira a tener todo el paquete aprobado para ese día, atentos a que el Presidente llegó a poner la Ley Bases como condición fundamental para ese hito de su gestión.
Esto le deja un margen de tiempo muy ajustado, dado que la Cámara tendría apenas tres semanas para tratar los proyectos en comisión y ponerlos a votación, con el detalle central de que sí o sí deben pasar siete días entre la firma de los dictámenes y su debate en el recinto. A eso se suma que para el 15 de mayo está prevista la sesión informativa con el jefe de Gabinete, Nicolás Posse.
La vicepresidenta Victoria Villarruel apuesta a lograr, con la ayuda de Francos, recrear la mayoría circunstancial de 39 votos que le permitió en diciembre pasado superaral kirchnerismo y asegurarse el control de las comisiones, esta vez para avanzar con la Ley Bases, pero en esta ocasión no parece algo sencillo.
Las diferencias que se registraron en Diputados hacia adentro de los bloques dialoguistas tendrían su correlato en el Senado y esto pone en duda varios puntos de los proyectos, entre ellos el RIGI y la restitución del Impuesto a las Ganancias que es rechazada por las provincias patagónicas, cuyos votos son determinantes en la Cámara alta. Por ello, nadie descarta que la Ley Bases y el paquete fiscal puedan volver con cambios a la Cámara baja.
La Ley Bases avanzó casi sin cambios: ¿cómo impidió agregados a la reforma laboral?
En la Cámara de Diputados la forma de votación por capítulos acordada con la oposición dialoguista le permitió a La Libertad Avanza bloquear nuevos cambios al proyecto, que el Gobierno ya se vio obligado a recortar desde los más de 600 artículos que tenía la primera versión a 232. La única excepción fue la incorporación, sobre el final del debate, del impuesto al tabaco para que todas las compañías del sector paguen el mismo tributo, en medio de las sospechas sobre un fuerte lobby empresarial.
No obstante, en los temas principales La Libertad Avanza logró evitar que se introdujeron más modificaciones, incluso las propuestas por algunos de los bloques que consensuaron esa mecánica con el oficialismo, como la UCR.
El ejemplo más notable de esto se dio con el capítulo de la reforma laboral, uno de los temas centrales de la Ley Bases, que se incluyó a pedido de la UCR pero que se suavizó por la presión que ejercieron Hacemos Coalición Federal y la CGT sobre el Gobierno para dejar afuera la eliminación de los aportes sindicales obligatorios que promovía el radicalismo.
La reforma contempla en sus puntos principales la derogación de multas por falta de registración laboral, la extensión del período de prueba a seis meses y el fondo de cese laboral como reemplazo del sistema de indemnizaciones, pero sujeto al acuerdo entre las partes en cada actividad.
Durante la votación en particular el diputado de la UCR Martín Tetaz pidió incorporar un artículo para declarar como "injuria grave" la "participación en bloqueos" a empresas y fábricas, que también figuraba en la redacción original y también la prohibición de los aportes obligatorios a los sindicatos para trabajadores no afiliados.
Sin embargo, el oficialismo rechazó esas modificaciones con el apoyo de la bancada que preside Miguel Pichetto y de PRO, de la misma manera que logró impedir cambios o incluso rechazos en otros temas muy sensibles para el Gobierno, como la delegación de facultades al Ejecutivo.
Milei, más cerca de tener facultades clave: privatizaciones, empleo público y más
El oficialismo logró dejar también en la Ley Bases la declaración de emergencias públicas y la delegación de facultades al Ejecutivo en materia administrativa, económica, financiera y energética por el plazo de un un año, un punto central para la gestión de Milei donde había un tema que corría particular riesgo: la facultad de modificar o eliminar numerosos órganos u organismos del Estado.
En la negociación con la oposición el Gobierno aceptó excluir de esa facultad a las universidades nacionales y los órganos del Poder Judicial y el Poder Legislativo, además de introducir la prohibición específica de disolver organismos como CONICET, ANMAT, INCAA, CONAE, ENACOM, INTA, entre otros. Sin embargo, no logró conformar a todos.
Buena parte de Hacemos Coalición Federal se opuso a este artículo (un rechazo encabezado por la Coalición Cívica, que decidió abandonar el interbloque) y lo mismo hizo un grupo de legisladores de la UCR, pero el oficialismo consiguió mantenerlo en pie con 135 votos a favor, 116 en contra y 2 abstenciones.
Este no fue un logro menor para el oficialismo, dado que es un tema clave para la reforma del Estado que se propone llevar adelante Milei, la cual incluye cambios en otras numerosas leyes que afectarán al empleo público y a las empresas estatales.
En ese marco, La Libertad Avanza hizo avanzar el capítulo sobre empleo público, que señala que el personal alcanzado afectado por la supresión de organismos o funciones "quedará automáticamente en situación de disponibilidad por un periodo máximo de hasta doce (12) meses" y terminado ese plazo quedará desvinculado de la administración pública, con derecho a una indemnización igual a "un mes de sueldo por cada año de servicio o fracción mayor de tres meses".
Asimismo, tras haber aceptado dejar afuera del plan de privatizaciones al Banco Nación y haber reducido la cantidad de empresas de 41 a tan solo 9, el Gobierno consiguió el aval de Diputados a este otro capítulo medular de la Ley Bases, donde quedarán 4 compañías con destino a privatización (entre las que se destacan Aerolíneas Argentinas, Radio y Televisión Argentina e Intercargo) y 5 para venta o concesión (AySA, Correo Argentino y Corredores Viales, entre otras).
Régimen de Inversiones y polémica por la derogación de la moratoria previsional
Otro tema sensible que tuvo numerosas críticas fue la creación del Régimen para las Grandes Inversiones (RIGI), que plantea beneficios fiscales, aduaneros y cambiarios para proyectos de inversión de más de u$s200 millones.
Por un lado, había varios cuestionamientos de cámaras industriales del interior del país por el artículo que otorga importantes exenciones impositivas a las importaciones de mercaderías para consumo. Además, casi todas las provincias criticaron que el capítulo del RIGI establezca que cualquier medida que tomen los distritos en contraposición con el régimen será nula.
Este punto es muy polémico porque el Congreso nacional no puede limitar la autonomía de las provincias para tener su propia legislación. Pese a ello el oficialismo logró que pasara sin cambios, aunque tanto Pichetto como el jefe de la bancada radical Rodrigo de Loredo advirtieron que estarán atentos a que el Ejecutivo cumpla la promesa de cambiar esto en la reglamentación si la ley finalmente se aprueba. Es posible que, antes, el Senado le imponga esa modificación.
Por otra parte, la Ley Bases también plantea la derogación de la moratoria previsional y su reemplazo por la figura Prestación de Retiro Proporcional para las personas que cumplieron 65 años y no cuentan con los 30 años de aportes necesarios para jubilarse. Quienes queden en esa figura cobrarán a partir de esa edad un haber mínimo equivalente a la Prestación Universal al Adulto Mayor (PUAM), que es el 80% de la jubilación mínima.
Este fue otro de los temas más conflictivos por la particularidad de que el cambio afectaría principalmente a las mujeres. Según los especialistas en temas previsionales, 9 de cada 10 mujeres no podrá jubilarse a los 60 años y deberá esperar hasta los 65 años para acceder a una PUAM. A pesar de haber sido aprobado, la controversia se notó en la votación, dado que fue el único capítulo que cosechó menos de 130 votos a favor.
Milei dio un paso importante, pero el resultado final todavía está abierto
Mientras esperaba por la votación del proyecto de Medidas Fiscales acordado con casi todos los gobernadores, la Casa Rosada ya celebraba el avance de la Ley de Bases en la Cámara de Diputados tras el tropiezo inicial de febrero.
En efecto, Milei necesitaba tener una primera victoria legislativa, aunque fuera tan solo con una media sanción. Las negociaciones que llevaron adelante Francos, Posse y Rolandi mostraron que el gobierno libertario empezó a comprender que está obligado a buscar acuerdos para avanzar con la gestión y moderar, para ellos, la agresividad verbal del mandatario contra el parlamento.
La necesidad de que el ambicioso plan de reformas del Presidente cuente con el consenso político que solo puede darle el Congreso es algo que reclama también el FMI, donde entienden a la perfección que Milei no puede gobernar solo con decretos de necesidad y urgencia que no otorgan la seguridad jurídica que los acreedores demandan.
De todas formas, la Ley Bases de Javier Milei dio apenas un primer paso en la Cámara de Diputados. La reforma laboral, el plan de privatizaciones, las facultades delegadas y los cambios impositivos que plantea el paquete de medidas fiscales deberán pasar ahora el filtro del Senado, con un resultado todavía abierto y con la cuenta regresiva para el Pacto de Mayo en marcha.

Article: El Moonshine, tiene una historia misteriosa y oculta. “Moonshine” quiere decir en inglés “brillo de la luna” o “luz de la luna”, y es que se creaba precisamente bajo esa luz. Los registros de este destilado, provienen del siglo XV, donde recién en Inglaterra el siglo XVIII, es utilizado para referirse a esta bebida, pero finalmente se potencia y hace su fama en Estados Unidos.
PUBLICIDAD
Para 1920, los moonshiners de todo ese país se regocijaron: se aprobó la Prohibición en todo el país. El alcohol legal ya no estaba disponible en ninguna parte. De la noche a la mañana, el licor ilegal se convirtió en uno de los negocios más rentables de Estados Unidos. Este alcohol era destilado por Moonshiners a la luz de la luna, entre quebradas, ríos, cerros, y esteros con el fin de no ser percibidos, e incautados por la policía o los federales.
Desde el país de los observatorios: para todo el mundo y premiado
Y si de observación planetaria y lunar se trata, Chile es experto. Los mejores observatorios del mundo se encuentran ahí, y al parecer, también uno de los mejores “moonshine”. La marca nacional de moonshine, The Old Bastard, obtuvo grandes puntajes en el London Spirits Competition 2024, donde logró cuatro medallas de plata en la categoría Whisk(e)y – American Moonshine.

El premio se obtuvo en una evaluación que consideró más de 2 mil destilados de 80 países, donde las más diversas bebidas alcohólicas pasan por distintas evaluaciones, destacando su sabor, la calidad, y el diseño del envase.
“Estos reconocimientos reflejan la excelencia y el compromiso de The Old Bastard de llevar al mercado uno de los moonshine más destacados del mercado, siendo premiado en uno de los concursos más relevantes del mundo como es el London Spirits Competition”, señaló Javier De Vicente, marca que tiene su sede en Vichuquén, en el corazón de la Región del Maule.
Bebida mística, con versiones curiosas
Y es que no hay “una versión” de este brebaje místico, si no que son varias:
The Old Bastard Chilean Moonshine Vhiskey recibió 88 puntos y fue descrito dentro del concurso como: “Un moonshine estilo whiskey americano, con audaces aromas terrosos, y a cuero, notas a canela, miel, turba especiada, caramelo dulce, madera, vainilla, ofreciendo una explosión de sabor armoniosa”.
En lo que respecta al The Old Bastard Chilean Moonshine Raw, recibió 87 Puntos y fue catalogado por los expertos como: “Un Moonshine que ofrece una textura agradable, con un perfil dulce y a su vez picante, termina con notas a vainilla dulce y un toque picante”.
En cuanto a The Old Bastard Chilean Moonshine Cinnamon fue evaluado con 86 Puntos, en donde destacó como un moonshine que “presenta fuertes aromas a canela en la nariz, con un sabor a canela correspondiente en el paladar. Es picante y dulce, parecido a un pastel de vainilla dulce con canela, con un alto nivel de especias”.
A estos puntajes se suma The Old Bastard Chilean Moonshine Green Chili, obteniendo 84 Puntos y teniendo como descripción “Este Moonshine ofrece notas de chile verde en la nariz y sabores picantes de chile en el paladar. Tiene una textura agradable, con un perfil dulce y picante. El sabor termina con una interesante sensación picante del ají verde”.

Article: La Cámara de Diputados eliminó la moratoria previsional a través de la votación en particular del título 9 que creó la "Prestación de Retiro Proporcional", tras 25 horas de sesión especial en el que se aborda la Ley de Bases. El resultado de la votación dejó 125 votos a favor, 113 en contra y tres abstenciones.
La nueva "Prestación de Retiro Proporcional" es una propuesta dirigida para aquellas mujeres que, a los 65 años, aún no cumplieron los 30 años de aportes que exige la ley.
Qué estipula la actual moratoria previsional
La última moratoria previsional puesta en marcha por el Gobierno de Alberto Fernández, permitía que personas que no habían llegado a los 30 años de aportes jubilatorios durante su ejercicio laboral pudieran igualmente acceder a una jubilación mínima a través de un programa en el que se les iba descontando de las cuotas de los haberes lo correspondiente por los años adeudados.
El Gobierno de Javier Milei consideró que no es justo para las personas que aportaron durante 30 o más años financiar a aquellas personas que por distintas circunstancias no llegaron a hacerlo.
De acuerdo a esta visión, la generalización de las moratorias y la universalización jubilatoria condujo a un achatamiento de la pirámide que va en detrimento de los ingresos de los jubilados que hicieron contribuciones al Sistema Integrado Previsional Argentino (SIPA) "durante toda su vida" laboral.
Jubilación para quienes no llegan a los 30 años de aporte
Lo que se propone la nueva Ley Bases es que quienes antes accedían a la moratoria, logren en su lugar una Prestación de Retiro Proporcional pero a los 65 años.
Es decir, no solo se elevaría la edad jubilatoria, sino que además no obtendrían más una jubilación sino un haber mínimo equivalente a la PUAM (Prestación Universal al Adulto Mayor) que equivale al 80% del haber mínimo, sin derecho a la pensión por viudez, al margen de los años efectivamente aportados, y si demuestran encontrarse en situación de vulnerabilidad social.
Sobre ese monto equivalente a la PUAM, se sumará un monto extra de acuerdo a los años de aportes que la persona haya registrado en el Sistema Integrado Previsional Argentino (SIPA). Es decir, una persona que cumplimentó 10 años de aportes no cobrará lo mismo que quiénes aportaron 25 años, pero no llegaron a los 30 que requiere la jubilación tradicional.
Pese al amplio debate que se dio en la sociedad sobre elevar la edad jubilatoria, en principio la Ley de Bases la dejaría en 60 años para las mujeres y 65 años para los hombres, siempre que hayan tenido además 30 años de aportes al sistema de Seguridad Social.
El cambio se daría entonces en la posibilidad de recibir un ingreso en su vejez para aquellas personas que no llegan a registrar esos 30 años. El nuevo beneficio para ellos no sería igual a una jubilación -sería una Prestación de Retiro Proporcional- y todos accederían al mismo recién a partir de los 65 años.

Article: Fallout llegó hace algunas semanas a Amazon Prime Video y, como se previó desde que salió al aire (Más allá de nuestras legítimas dudas de cómo se podría adaptar un juego tan complejo), ha sido un éxito rotundo. Se ha hablado mucho del impacto de la serie en la franquicia, pero ahora Amazon ha revelado las cifras oficiales y son demoledoras: más de 65 millones de espectadores en sus primeros 16 días en la plataforma.

Un éxito rotundo, pero con algunas dudas
Si bien, la cantidad de espectadores es impresionante, Amazon no ha especificado cómo contabiliza a los mismos. No se sabe si se considera a alguien que ve media hora, un episodio completo o toda la temporada. A pesar de esta falta de claridad, la cifra sigue siendo enorme.
Según Variety, Fallout ha pasado de ser uno de los tres programas más vistos de Amazon a ser el segundo de todos los tiempos. Además, se ha convertido en el programa más visto en la categoría de edad de 18 a 34 años, y el 60% de la audiencia proviene de fuera de los Estados Unidos, con especial éxito en Reino Unido, Francia y Brasil.

Temporada 2 confirmada y futuro prometedor
No es de extrañar que, con estas cifras, la temporada 2 de Fallout se haya confirmado poco más de una semana después del estreno de la primera. Ver que Amazon no solo ha hecho tremenda justicia a la franquicia -y de paso, demostró que sí se pueden hacer buenas series a partir de videojuegos, tal como en Max con The Last Of Us-, sino que también ha conquistado a fans nuevos y antiguos, es algo que alegra a los seguidores de la saga.
Como ya he comentado en otras ocasiones, creo que Microsoft y Bethesda han perdido una gran oportunidad al no tener algo nuevo que ofrecer a los jugadores en este momento. Si bien la actualización de Fallout 4 para la nueva generación ha sido recibida con opiniones mixtas, los nuevos jugadores tienen un catálogo anterior extenso para disfrutar.
En definitiva, Fallout en Prime Video ha sido un éxito rotundo, y su futuro parece prometedor. Solo queda esperar para ver qué nos deparan las próximas temporadas.

Article: La oposición dialoguista sacó a relucir su lado más confrontativo este martes a la hora de votar un artículo de la ley Bases que propone que el "Señor del Tabaco" vuelva a pagar la misma alícuota de impuesto interno a los cigarrillos que pagan sus competidores.
Es que, pese a los esfuerzos de La Libertad Avanza y el PRO (sobre todo de Cristian Ritondo), sorpresivamente, Hacemos Coalición Federal, la UCR e Innovación Federal provocaron un duro golpe al lobby empresario al lograr darle media sanción a este aspecto incluido en el paquete de medidas.
Ley de Bases: dura derrota para Ritondo y el "Señor del Tabaco"
La abstención de casi todos los legisladores de Unión por la Patria y 21 que votaron a favor (entre ellos Victoria Tolosa Paz) allanó el camino para que Pablo Otero, conocido como el "Señor del Tabaco" y dueño de la tabacalera Sarandí, deje de recibir privilegios impositivos.
El resultado de la votación fue muy cerrado: 82 votos afirmativos, 77 votos negativos, 69 abstenciones.
De este modo, Otero, que maneja el 33% del mercado, volverá a pagar la alícuota del 73% de los impuestos internos al tabaco (hoy paga 70%) en caso de que el Senado convierta en ley el proyeto.
En este marco, trascendió que el oficialismo hizo todo lo posible para que la quita de privilegios al "Señor del Tabaco" no se votara este martes y Ritondo era el más interesado por evitarlo. Sin embargo, el legislador de Propuesta Republicana fue tomado por sorpresa y, apenas finalizada la votación de la ley de Bases, se dirigió al despacho de Martín Menem para trasladarse sus reclamos. Sostuvo que lo que se había votado era solo la incorporación del capítulo en el texto, pero faltaba la aprobación en particular de sus artículos.
Cristian Ritondo, el gran aliado del "Señor del Tabaco"
Oficialmente se informa muy poco. Se habla en público de reuniones positivas y amables con legisladores de Hacemos Coalición Federal, bloque comandado por Miguel Ángel Pichetto, o con diputados aliados del PRO, liderados por Cristian Ritondo, o se recibe a Alfredo Olmedo, parlamentario salteño, sojero y millonario del PARLASUR, para analizar la nueva ley Bases que comenzó a tratarse en el Congreso. Y, todas son reuniones que transcurren con normalidad y terminan siendo positivas según expresan sin ponerse colorados.
Pero, lo que los voceros no dicen, es que las reuniones entre algunos funcionarios de Javier Milei y diputados "dialoguistas" son en la mayoría de los casos "a cara de perro" y, esto sucede, porque en su afán renovador, la administración libertaria está tocando intereses muy sensibles como el que beneficia al empresario Pablo Otero de Tabacalera Sarandí al que se lo vio muy nervioso en los últimos tiempos remitiendo, a través de sus costosos abogados, cartas documentos para todo periodista que se le ocurra informar acerca de la cuestión.
Lo sufrió Andrés Sanguinetti de este medio, pero, también, Diego Cabot y Camila Dolabjian de La Nación, y Marcelo Longobardi de Radio Rivadavia.
Sea como fuere, la realidad indica que, de las extensas negociaciones políticas por el nuevo envío de la ley Bases al Congreso, Otero sale beneficiado una vez más en su lucha contra Massalin Particulares S.A, la controlante de Philip Morris y la British American Tobacco, que observan cómo Tabacalera Sarandí, en sociedad con la multinacional británica Imperial Brands, ganan cada vez más volúmenes de venta de paquetes de cigarrillos de sus marcas, Red Point, West o Nevada, no por las propiedades exquisitas del tabaco que comercializan sino por su atractivo precio, mucho más barato para el desahuciado consumidor argentino que prefiere pagar un poco menos por su vicio y no convalidar los precios de venta de marcas como Phillip Morris, Marlboro o Chesterfieldde Massalin o Camel, Lucky Strike de la British American Tobacco.
No es que el resto de las compañías no quisieran ofrecer sus atados de cigarrillos al mismo precio que los comercializa Tabacalera Sarandí, sino que no pueden hacerlo porque tienen encima la carga impositiva de un impuesto interno que la empresa de Pablo Otero no paga gracias a una decisión de la Justicia.
A fines de febrero, iProfesional lo había adelantado de manera exclusiva, ni Javier Milei pudo quitar los privilegios en el Congreso de Tabacalera Sarandí.

Article: Se trata de Susana Balbo, la bodega de la primera mujer enóloga de la Argentina, que ofrece a sus clientes la posibilidad de mitigar el impacto en el medioambiente de su envío a domicilio a través de la adquisición de un "Crédito de carbono".
A su vez, la empresa realiza el mismo esfuerzo que sus clientes para poder duplicar el impacto positivo en la reducción de la huella de carbono. Esta iniciativa sustentable nace de la asociación con The Option for Climate Change (TOCC).
"El promedio de emisión de carbono por envío es de alrededor de 1.11 kilogramo CO2e. Con la compra de una fracción de crédito de carbono, estamos colaborando con proyectos que reducen las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero (GEI) o recuperan el carbono existente en la atmósfera. Desde la bodega duplicamos la apuesta: por cada envío nuestros clientes neutralizan, nosotros adquirimos la misma cantidad de créditos para lograr un mayor impacto en la reducción de la huella de carbono", comenta Ana Lovaglio Balbo, directora de Marketing de la bodega Susana Balbo.
Desde que implementaron esta acción en julio de 2023, casi un 8% de los consumidores mostraron interés en esta iniciativa. "Esperamos que cada vez más personas nos acompañen en este proyecto y logremos cada vez tener un mayor impacto", agregó Ana.
Vinos cada vez más sustentables
La iniciativa surge de la experiencia previa con grandes empresas de la región en la problemática de las emisiones de carbono del equipo de TOCC, Federico Martico y Julieta Cayre. Reconociendo que neutralizar no es una tarea fácil, crearon el mercado de carbono minorista con el objetivo de alcanzar a todas las personas que desean neutralizar su impacto negativo sobre el medio ambiente de forma fácil y segura.
"En la actualidad, existen 7.000 millones de consumidores en el mundo que desconocen el impacto ambiental de sus compras y carecen de acceso a herramientas para reducir o mitigar su huella de carbono. Por esto nace The Option for Climate Change, para centrarnos en la logística de compras online y crear una solución simple que permita a millones de consumidores conocer la huella de carbono de sus compras y mitigar el impacto con solo un click de forma segura", comparte Julieta Cayre, cofundadora y CEO de TOCC.
"Es importante que nos involucremos en conocer el impacto ambiental de nuestras acciones y busquemos marcas que nos acompañan en el proceso. No olvidemos que, como consumidores, poseemos un poder imperceptible pero significativo en la economía. Nuestras decisiones de consumo impulsan la economía y todo lo que consumimos y cómo lo consumimos tiene impacto ambiental. Por eso, elegir marcas comprometidas como Susana Balbo es esencial. Cada elección que hacemos tiene un impacto, y al optar por marcas comprometidas, contribuimos a un futuro más sostenible", concluye Julieta.

Article: Un grupo de rescate de caimanes ofreció ayudar a encontrar a Wally, un caimán de apoyo emocional muy conocido en la región de Filadelfia, que recientemente fue robado durante un viaje al sur y liberado en la naturaleza.
Wallygator, la página de Facebook, ha estado compartiendo actualizaciones sobre la búsqueda de Wally desde finales de la semana pasada.

El robo aparentemente ocurrió el domingo 21 de abril en Brunswick, Georgia, según la propietaria de Wally, Joie Henney.
Después de la publicación inicial sobre el robo, su dueña informó el domingo que Wally fue secuestrado por una persona a la que le gusta arrojar caimanes en los jardines de casas "para aterrorizar" a sus habitantes. Luego, el departamento estatal de recursos naturales consiguió un trampero que capturó a Wally y lo liberó en un pantano con otros de su especie.
"El pantano es muy grande y el trampero dijo que las posibilidades de encontrar a Wally son escasas o nulas", decía la publicación.
Los Gator Boys intervinieron para intentar recuperar a Wally, pero hasta el lunes 29 de abril de 2024 todavía estaban recopilando información para rastrear la ubicación exacta de Wally.

Article: La mayoría de las casi 400,000 personas que viajan en el Metro todos los días pasan por las puertas de tarifa sin problema alguno.
Pero el sistema de tránsito también dice que más de 4,000 veces al día, un mensaje de error causa que el jefe o gerente de la estación tenga que asistir a los usuarios.

Por eso, en las próximas semanas la agencia de tránsito implementará una nueva estrategia. Enviarán mensajes alertando que tu tarjeta SmarTrip está desactivada, expirada o inválida.
El propósito es que conozcas de antemano cuál es el error por el que te niegan el acceso a la estación y de esta forma arreglarlo cuanto antes.
Estos nuevos mensajes en las puertas de tarifa ya están activadas en ocho estaciones y pronto lo estarán en las 98 estaciones.
Metro espera que el cambio pueda ser la solución a un problema molesto.

Article: El croata Luka Modric se convirtió en el Allianz Arena, en el partido de ida de las semifinales de la Liga de Campeones ante el Bayern Munich, en el futbolista más veterano que disputa un partido de la Copa de Europa con el Real Madrid, a la edad de 38 años y 234 días, superando el registro de Ferenc Puskás.
El récord de Puskás, 38 años y 229 días, databa del 17 de noviembre de 1965 en un partido de la Copa de Europa del Real Madrid contra el Kilmarnock, según datos de BeSoccer para EFE. Modric lo superó en su partido 528 con el conjunto madridista, el 118 en Liga de Campeones.
El centrocampista, que entró al césped del Allianz a los 76 minutos por Jude Bellingham, superó también los 527 encuentros de Roberto Carlos en la clasificación histórica de jugadores con más partidos con el Real Madrid, pasando a ser el decimocuarto que más disputó; el quinto en la 'Champions' por detrás de Iker Casillas, Karim Benzema, Raúl González y Sergio Ramos.

Article: El técnico del Bayern Múnich, el alemán Thomas Tuchel, lamentó las "ocasiones para el 3-1" que no marcaron frente a un Real Madrid que les acabó empatando en el partido de ida de las semifinales de la Liga de Campeones.
"Fueron unos buenos 10 a 15 primeros minutos. Con buenas ocasiones para nosotros. Después el partido no ha sido tan fluido y concedimos una ocasión y un gol, perdiendo algo de confianza y ritmo. En las segunda parte volvimos a jugar más fluido. Tuvimos ocasiones para el 3-1, no las marcamos y nos castigaron", analizó el alemán en Movistar+.
En esta línea, afirmó que "ellos lo hacen con muchos rivales, tuvimos ocasiones de ganar el partido y ahora tenemos que ir al 'Santiago Bernabéu' la semana que viene".
"Para la vuelta tenemos que ser más clínicos y tener más oportunidades. Es un partido abierto. Hay que mejorar en las defensas individuales y ser más fuertes. Además, tener confianza para ganar", añadió.
EL LAMENTO DEL EQUIPO ALEMÁN
Un empate contra el Real Madrid que lamentaron también Joshua Kimmich y Jamal Musiala.
"Creo que fuimos mejores, pero si cometes errores acabas concediendo goles. El que gane se lo lleva y no queda otra que ir a por la victoria", valoró Kimmich.
"Hay muchas cosas positivas que destacar, pero también negativas. Pudimos haber salido con una victoria, pero el Real Madrid tiene la capacidad de generar peligro de la nada. Es un poco frustrante irse con un empate 2-2, pero hay que tener la cabeza alta y confianza para ir y ganarlo allí", declaró Musiala.

Article: Fuentes de la señal noticiosa informaron que la desvinculación se produjo por una combinación de bajo rating y escasa facturación publicitaria. Destacaron la calidad profesional del reconocido periodista.
Tras semanas de especulaciones, finalmente se confirmó la desvinculación del reconocido periodista Ari Paluch del canal Extra TV. Fuentes cercanas a la señal noticiosa indicaron que la medida fue tomada debido a que no se pudieron alcanzar los objetivos fijados en materia de audiencia y facturación publicitaria.
El regreso de Paluch a la televisión -alejado de los medios desde 2017- generó expectativas entre los seguidores del periodista. Sin embargo, después de tres meses al frente de un magazine matutino en Extra TV, el nivel de rating no cubrió las expectativas del canal.
En momentos críticos para todos los medios, el programa del destacado profesional tampoco pudo lograr el nivel de ingresos que su calidad profesional y trayectoria se merecían. Es sabido que Ari Paluch supo tener anunciantes fieles que lo seguían siempre más allá de la señal en la que estuviera, pero en esta oportunidad esa situación no se produjo.
“En materia comercial, los resultados son inferiores a los objetivos fijados para ese horario al momento de la contratación del periodista. El canal actuó de buena fe y conforme a la ley avisando con tiempo a Paluch de la decisión de finalizar el contrato, situación por supuesto prevista en el mismo”, confirmaron fuentes de Extra TV.
Ari Paluch Inició su carrera en 1985 en la radio, junto a Mario Pergolini, en "Feedback". En 1987 se hizo cargo de Rock & Pop 2, en Radio Bangkok.
Incursionó en la televisión en 1991 con "Crema americana", un ciclo que llevó adelante junto a Juan Castro y Pato Galván en América TV.
Cinco años más tarde se dedicó al periodismo político. Fue en ese año que Marcelo Tinelli lo convocó para llevar adelante la primera mañana de Radio Uno. Trabajó en Latina 101.1 FM, Concepto FM 95.5, AM 550 Colonia, Rivadavia AM 63 y R770 AM.
A fines de la década del 2000 incursionó en el ámbito de la autoayuda y la espiritualidad, tras editar El Combustible Espiritual, un libro sobre superación personal.
Su programa El Exprimidor, que condujo desde 1996, fue distinguido con cinco Martín Fierro, Premio Clarín, Mención Especial del Buenos Aires Herald, y varios Broadcasting.

Article: Thalía aclara supuesta discusión con Becky G: "La gente es chismosa"
Las cantantes tuvieron una supuesta pelea en el escenario de los Latin American Music Awards.
Las cantantes tuvieron una supuesta pelea en el escenario de los Latin American Music Awards.
Tras varias especulaciones, Thalía aclaró la supuesta discusión con Becky G en la ceremonia de los Latin American Music Awards.
A través de redes sociales, un video comenzó a circular donde se ve a las cantantes tener una presunta pelea en el que, según rumores, la intérprete de "Equivocada" habría estado furiosa porque el vestuario de la conductora del evento, Alejandra Espinoza, era similar al suyo.
A raíz de esto, la estadounidense habría salido en defensa de la animadora, llamando a su par a "dejar de gritar" en pleno escenario, haciendo varios gestos que parecían evidenciar su molestía.
Mediante su cuenta de TikTok, la intérprete de "María la del barrio" decidió terminar con los rumores y contar la verdad tras el clip.
"La gente es mitotera y chismosa", partió diciendo la mexicana. "Estábamos hablando de nuestros performances. Ella (Becky) nos estaba contando que los zapatos que usó en su presentación no se los había tratado en el ensayo", relató.
Bajo esta línea, Thalía afirmó que la voz de "Shower" mencionó que el suelo estaba resbaladizo para ella, "entonces yo le digo por eso yo siempre ensayo con mis zapatos con los que voy a cantar".
"Eso es todo, no sean mitoteros ni chismosos. Becky y G nos amamos. Carlos Ponce (animador de la premiación), Ale, Becky y yo nos amamos, y los mitoteros salen sobrando así que no empiecen a echar chisme", sentenció la esposa de Tommy Mottola.
@thalia Ya ni en mis novelas, hay tanto drama🤣🤭🤪 ven que fácil inventan cosas los que no tienen nada que hacer 😂 Aqui solo hay PURO amor a la mexicana y nos amamos #beckyg #alejandraespinoza 🏼🥰#carlosponce ♬ original sound - Thalia

Article: En el estadio Mario Alberto Kempes, Estudiantes de La Plata se aseguró un lugar en la final de la Copa de la Liga Profesional al derrotar a Boca 3-1 en los penales, tras igualar 1-1 en el tiempo reglamentario.
Estudiantes de La Plata fue más certero en los penales y eficaz en los 90 minutos para vencer a Boca Juniors por 3-1 desde los doce pasos tras igualar 1-1 en el tiempo reglamentario del partido que disputaron en el estadio Mario Alberto Kempes de Córdoba.
El equipo que orienta Eduardo Domínguez se ganó de esta manera un lugar en la final del próximo domingo a las 15.30 en la que enfrentará a Vélez Sarsfield en Santiago del Estero.
Miguel Merentiel abrió la cuenta para Boca a los 40 minutos de la etapa inicial y cuando parecía que el equipo de Diego Martínez tenía todo controlado, un insólito penal dee Cristian Lema sobre Tiago Palacios le permitió a Edwin Cetré nivelar las cosas y forzar los penales.
Y en esa instancia se lució Matías Mansilla al contener los remates de Cavani y Figal, mientras que Merentiel estrelló su tiro en el travesaño.
Tras un inicio complicado, Boca fue el claro dominador de la parte inicial de la que se retiró en ventaja merecidamente por la mínima diferencia aunque pudo haber marcado algún gol más.
Pero como siempre ocurre en el inicio, el Xeneize durmió. Y Estudiantes casi se lo factura. Había transcurrido poco más de un minuto cuando Guido Carrillo, completamente libre, cabeceó cómodo un córner desde inmejorable posición y Chiquito Romero evitó la apertura del marcador.
Con mucha gente en el centro del terreno y ambos laterales trepando por las bandas, el conjunto platense siguió dominando un rato más, con Tiago Palacios como eje de sus ataques. Pero una vez que Boca se despertó, el encuentro cambió.
Equi Fernández, principalmente, y Pol Fernández fueron ganando el centro del terreno. De a poco se sumaron Zenón, fundamentalmente, y por momentos Medina, y el equipo de Diego Martínez se empezó a animar más y a generar situaciones de riesgo sobre el área pincharrata.
A los 10 salvó Matías Mansilla, en primera instancia, y Luciano Lollo, en segunda, tras un toque de Medina dentro del área chica después de un centro pasado de Lautaro Blanco. A los 24 el arquero despejó un tiro libre ejecutado por Zenón y dos minutos más tarde, tras un pase profundo de Equi Fernández, Merentiel estrelló la pelota en el palo con el guardavalla ya jugado.
Era todo de Boca, salvo el gol, que llegó sobre los 40 en la mejor jugada del partido. Una excelsa habilitación de Zenón a Luis Advincula por derecha derivó en un centro preciso del peruano que Merentiel conectó de derecha, agarrando a Mansilla yendo para el otro lado, para poner el merecido 1-0 parcial.
Lo pudo liquidar Boca sobre los 17 del complemento con una gran contra generada por Merentiel, quien le dio una magistral asistencia a Medina, pero el disparo por un costado del arquero del volante fue rechazado al córner por un defensor pincharrata.
Mejoró Estudiantes con el ingreso de Cetré pero casi no inquietaba. Hasta que sobre los 27, en una jugada aislada y tras una serie de rebotes, la pelota derivó en Tiago Palacios que estaba dentro del área a punto de cabecear cuando Lema, en su afán por despejar, levantó su pierna, lo golpeó en la cara, cometió el penal con el que Cetré marcó el empate y dejó a su equipo con un hombre menos al ver la doble amarilla.
Boca se desarmó y todo lo bueno que venía haciendo se esfumó. Y Estudiantes tuvo todo para ganarlo en el último cuarto de hora. Lo tuvo Carrillo a los 41, cuando cabeceó con fuerza un centro de Cetré pero Romero rechazó la pelota hacia un costado. Y unos minutos más tarde fue Javier Correa el que perdió el mano a mano con Chiquito. Los cambios le hicieron bien al equipo de Eduardo Domínguez.
No varió nada en el cierre y hubo que ir a los penales y esta vez la suerte no estuvo del lado de Boca. Mansilla se lució frente a remates muy anunciados y Romero solo pudo atajar un penal. Pasó Estudiantes y ahora irá por una nueva coronación frente a Vélez.

Article: La Coordinadora de Familiares y Víctimas de Trauma Ocular, una de las organizaciones que aglutina a algunos de los más de 400 heridos oculares por disparos de balines o bombas lacrimógenas en las protestas de 2019, lamentó este martes la decisión del Poder Judicial de aplazar al 1 de octubre la audiencia de imputación formal de cargos contra el director general de Carabineros, Ricardo Yáñez.
La audiencia estaba prevista originalmente para el próximo 7 de mayo, pero el Séptimo Juzgado de Garantía de Santiago acogió la solicitud presentada por el fiscal Centro Norte, Xavier Armendáriz, para postergarla, en medio de la conmoción nacional por el asesinato de tres carabineros en la comuna de Cañete, en la Región del Biobío, ocurrido en la madrugada del sábado.
El director de Carabineros será imputado previsiblemente junto a su predecesor, Mario Rozas, y el exsubdirector de Carabineros Diego Olate por el delito omisivo de apremios ilegítimos con resultado de lesiones graves y homicidio, cometido presuntamente entre octubre de 2019 y el 31 de marzo de 2020, época en que el actual jefe de la institución ejercía como director nacional de Orden y Seguridad.
En las últimas semanas, Yáñez ha interpuesto una serie de acciones judiciales con el fin de dejar esta audiencia sin efecto; de hecho, el mismo tribunal ya rechazó su solicitud para suspenderla hace una semana.
Esto lo mantenía contra las cuerdas, ya que el Gobierno planteó un criterio bajo el cual las autoridades que lleguen a ser formalizadas por algún delito deberían renunciar a sus cargos, por lo que se preveía su dimisión.
Sin embargo, tras el asesinato de tres carabineros en la Región del Biobío, el Ejecutivo salió este fin de semana a respaldar al jefe policial.
Por otra parte, el Partido Comunista (PC) manifestó sus sospechas respecto a si la decisión de aplazar la audiencia respondió a un "criterio político", por lo que el fiscal nacional, Ángel Valencia, aseveró en Cooperativa que "cualquier especulación sobre motivos adicionales" a lo argumentado por Armendáriz "no tiene sentido".
Ante la postergación, la Coordinadora de Familiares y Víctimas de Trauma Ocular se manifestó frente al Palacio de la Moneda este martes, exigiendo que este caso no quede impune.
"No hagamos un aprovechamiento político de esta situación, de la muerte de los tres carabineros, ni mezclemos las cosas. Hoy día se está buscando la impunidad de Carabineros por la violación de derechos humanos durante el estallido. Nos parece impresentable", dijo Marta Valdés, vocera de la asociación, a Cooperativa.
"En este país está la cultura de la impunidad. Estamos cansados de la impunidad", enfatizó la representante de las víctimas, antes de plantear que "esto de ir aplazando y aplazando" la comparecencia del alto mando ante la Justicia les hace sospechar que los acusados "van a jugar al olvido y simplemente (Yáñez) no va a ser sacado de su cargo".

Article: Para que no afecte la inflación de mayo, el Poder Ejecutivo decidió postergar la actualización del Impuesto a los Combustibles.
Con el fin de frenar el impacto sobre la inflación, el Poder Ejecutivo publicará un Decreto en el Boletín Oficial, a través del cual se diferirá la fecha en la que tendrá efecto la actualización correspondiente al Impuesto a los Combustibles.
Además, el Ministerio de Economía decidió postergar los aumentos de tarifas de gas y electricidad que tendrían que haberse aplicada a partir de mayo. A partir de este miércoles debía empezar a regir la fórmula de actualización mensual de las tarifas de gas y electricidad que el Gobierno diseñó para que los aumentos otorgados no queden atrasados respecto de la inflación.
Sin embargo, los entes reguladores de ambos servicios, Enargas y ENRE, respectivamente, no publicaron los nuevos cuadros tarifarios a la espera de una definición de Economía.
Los entes reguladores ya tienen calculado cuánto sería la suba que le correspondería a las empresas: 10,69% para las distribuidoras eléctricas, 12,5% para las distribuidoras de gas y 12% para las transportistas de gas.
Economía debía definir si avanzaba con una quita de subsidios para los sectores de ingresos bajos (N2) y medios (N3) en gas y electricidad; si aumentaba el costo que pagan los comercios, industrias y hogares de ingresos altos, y si autorizaba el ajuste mensual de tarifas para las empresas.
Al final, nada de esos sucederá y todo continuará como estaba o peor, ya que la inflación y la devaluación mensual se mantiene al ritmo del 7% y 2% mensual y cada vez más los usuarios residenciales de ingresos bajos y medios demandan más subsidios.
En cuanto a los combustibles, a partir de la norma que se publicará en el Boletín Oficial, el Gobierno definió diferir la actualización correspondiente al cuarto trimestre de 2023 de los Impuestos sobre los Combustibles y al Dióxido de Carbono para la nafta sin plomo, la nafta virgen y el gasoil, al 1 de junio de 2024.
De esta manera, la medida garantiza previsibilidad al sector y establece que no habrá incremento alguno, por dichos conceptos, en mayo.

Article: "Comunidades que Leen" es el nombre de un proyecto implementado por el Fondo de Solidaridad e Inversión Social (Fosis) junto a la Fundación Observa Ciudadanía, y que busca atender al rezago de lectoescritura provocado en niños por la pandemia.
La iniciativa -que contempla tutorías comunitarias y creación de "rincones de lectura"- incluye ya a 10 colegios del SLEP Barrancas de la Región Metropolitana, y ha beneficiado a más de 200 niños segundo a cuarto básico, en colaboración con el Plan de Reactivación Educativa del Mineduc.
Este programa permite a los escolares pequeños "interactuar con libros y así mejorar sus habilidades de lectoescritura: se les abre un mundo infinito con la lectura, con sus personajes, y espacios para aprender de manera entretenida y didáctica", destaca el director nacional de Fosis, Nicolás Navarrete.
"Lo primero que hace 'Comunidades que Leen' es desarrollar un espacio de trabajo conjunto con las escuelas y las comunidades educativas, reconociendo que ellas ya desarrollan planes de lectura y están haciendo muchos esfuerzos con los estudiantes que van quedando rezagados. 'Comunidades que Leen' trabaja con ellas, pero a partir de metodologías de innovación y participativas, donde las y los estudiantes son protagonistas del proceso de aprendizaje", resalta Óscar Guerra, director ejecutivo de la Fundación Observa Ciudadanía.

Article: El efectivo de la Federal fue atacado en un robo, en el que murió asesinada su novia. Lo operarán nuevamente para que vuelva a caminar.
El efectivo de la Policía Federal que fue baleado en la Autopista del Oeste, donde su novia fue asesinada de un disparo en la cabeza, podría no volver a caminar, aunque los médicos evalúan operarlo por segunda vez para evitar esa situación.
El domingo por la tarde Lucas Buena (30) viajaba en moto con su pareja Noelia Velázquez (27) cuando fueron sorprendidos por al menos tres motochorros. En medio de la Autopista del Oeste comenzó una balacera que finalizó con la joven muerta tras recibir un disparo en la cabeza y el agente con un tiro en el omóplato izquierdo.
En el lugar una testigo reveló que logró escuchar al hombre decirle a los médicos que "no sentía sus piernas".
Sin embargo, Adrián Buena, hermano del efectivo, remarcó en declaraciones a Noticias Argentinas que a ellos no les "dijeron nada" sobre el hecho de no volver a caminar.
Es que los médicos aún no quieren dar un diagnóstico definitivo, ya que evalúan volver a operarlo para evitar esa situación.
Por lo tanto, esperarán para poder dar un diagnóstico definitivo.
Buena fue operado y en estos momentos se encuentra internado en terapia intensiva, con pronóstico reservado y con asistencia respiratoria. En el caso hay un detenido, mientras que otros dos delincuentes siguen prófugos.
La captura Santiago Pedro Verón se logró después de que se presente en un hospital de San Miguel con su mamá y solicite ayuda tras haber recibido un disparo en una pierna "durante un robo".
Sin embargo, los médicos dudaron y luego de dar aviso a la Policía se pudo concretar su detención.
Adrián Buena, hermano del efectivo de la PFA, habló con Noticias Argentinas y se mostró furioso por el caso: "El delincuente se presentó en el hospital con su mamá. Es indignante que una madre apañe a su hijo delincuente. Da bronca".
"A uno lo educan de una manera para manejarse en la vida y acá ves a una madre que apaña a un delincuente", remarcó.

Article: José Antonio Neme y Latife Soto llevan un tiempo haciendo un live en Instagram todos los domingos, en el que hablan de las predicciones de la tarotista. Es en este contexto que, en el capítulo más reciente, recordaron una que al parecer se habría cumplido.
«Se me vino a la mente todo lo que veníamos anunciando desde febrero. Yo decía: a fines de abril vamos a tener un hecho muy triste para los chilenos. Creo que en algunos de los lives yo dije ‘estallido delictual’. No sé si te acuerdas», comenzó señalando la guía espiritual.
Frente a lo cual, Neme le respondió: «Tú, desde hace muchos meses, venías diciendo que iban a haber casos de corte policial que iban a movilizar a la ciudadanía y que iban a tocar la fibra ciudadana, que iba a haber una suerte de movimiento ciudadano pidiendo más seguridad, y perdón, es lo que estamos viendo. Tú lo dijiste en febrero».
«Dijiste, además, que prácticamente la presencia militar es una decisión que se va a tomar sí o sí, y pareciera que todo va hacia ese lugar. Tú lo vienes anunciando en este programa. Los programas están en mi muro por si alguien los quiere revisar», continuó el animador de ‘Mucho Gusto’.
Latife Soto sorprende con nueva predicción
Tras esto, es que José Antonio Neme le consultó si acaso se vendrían cosas pronto en nuestro país. «No sé qué más pudiste ver el fin de semana, a qué estamos expuestos. Yo ya no me atrevo a afirmar ni desmentir ninguna cosa».
«Lamentablemente, veo que este no va a hacer el único hecho y creo que lo mencioné en algunos de los lives: yo veo que hay ciertas zonas que están elegidas para atacar. Lo que se viene son ataques en comisarías, buses de Carabineros y todo ese tipo de cosas», afirmó Latife Soto.
Junto con recordar que «también dije la semana pasada que el Presidente se va a ver muy presionado para sacar a los militares».

Article: La secretaria general de la Organización Meteorológica Mundial, Celeste Saulo, está de visita en Chile y, en conversación con Cooperativa, relevó la importancia de que "cada ciudadano asuma un rol activo" en desafíos globales como la mitigación de los gases de efecto invernadero.
"Tenemos que evitar el discurso que paraliza y promover el discurso que compromete a las nuevas generaciones en pensar que son artífices de un mundo mejor, y para eso hay que trabajar: nada viene dado con naturalidad", señaló la meteoróloga argentina a Lo Que Queda del Día.
Saulo -primera mujer en liderar la OMM- se reunió con el canciller Alberto van Klaveren para conversar sobre la iniciativa "Alertas Tempranas para Todos", que promueve la ONU y destina fondos internacionales para el reforzamiento de los sistemas preventivos de cada país.
En el panorama general, "Latinoamérica tiene el desafío de apuntalar a sus servicios meteorológicos e hidrológicos", ejemplificó la experta.

Article: Fracasó la reunión del Consejo del Salario Mínimo, Vital y Móvil para determinar el nuevo monto y lo terminará definiendo la Secretaría de Trabajo.
La reunión del Consejo del Salario Mínimo, Vital y Móvil (SMVM) finalizó sin acuerdo y deberá volver a definir la Secretaría de Trabajo a través de un laudo el nivel de ajuste que llevará a cabo.
Los actuales $202.800 con base de marzo son producto de la decisión unilateral del gobierno de Javier Milei de otorgar un aumento y volverá a ocurrir lo mismo para los próximos tres meses. Según fuentes de la Secretaría de Trabajo, en los próximos tres días hábiles, debería publicarse el laudo con los nuevos valores.
La CGT y las dos CTA pugnaban por un ajuste de hasta 80% del SMVM, contra un 8% de mayo y 5% en junio que propusieron las centrales obreras. Ante tanta diferencia, no hubo acercamiento posible y deberá decidir el Gobierno.
"Las tres centrales sindicales unificamos las propuestas en $377.000 para el mes de abril que equivale un 80% de aumento y para estar por encima de la canasta de la indigencia. Sin embargo, los empresarios propusieron insólitamente un aumento del 8% para el mes de mayo y un 5% para junio", explicó Hugo "Cachorro" Godoy, secretario General de la CTA Autónoma desde su cuenta de X.
"Como no hubo acuerdo, el gobierno y los empresarios de la UIA, la CAME y la Sociedad Rural impidieron el pleno funcionamiento del Consejo y obligaron a un final bochornoso en el cual el gobierno decidirá, una vez más por decreto, y seguramente en contra de los intereses de los trabajadores", denunció el dirigente gremial.
El monto que solicitan las centrales obreras busca dejar el Salario mínimo por encima de la canasta de indigencia. En cambio el Gobierno, podría aplicar aumentos en base a las inflaciones proyectadas, lo cual sería un monto mucho mas cercano a los deseos de las centrales empresariales.
El Salario Mínimo, Vital y Móvil cayó un 34,1% desde que asumió Javier Milei, de acuerdo a un informe elaborado por el Centro de Investigación y Formación (CIFRA) de la Central de los Trabajadores de la Argentina (CTA).

Article: Un grupo de rescate de caimanes ofreció ayudar a encontrar a Wally, un caimán de apoyo emocional muy conocido en la región de Filadelfia, que recientemente fue robado durante un viaje al sur y liberado en la naturaleza.
Wallygator, la página de Facebook, ha estado compartiendo actualizaciones sobre la búsqueda de Wally desde finales de la semana pasada.

El robo aparentemente ocurrió el domingo 21 de abril en Brunswick, Georgia, según la propietaria de Wally, Joie Henney.
Después de la publicación inicial sobre el robo, su dueña informó el domingo que Wally fue secuestrado por una persona a la que le gusta arrojar caimanes en los jardines de casas "para aterrorizar" a sus habitantes. Luego, el departamento estatal de recursos naturales consiguió un trampero que capturó a Wally y lo liberó en un pantano con otros de su especie.
"El pantano es muy grande y el trampero dijo que las posibilidades de encontrar a Wally son escasas o nulas", decía la publicación.
Los Gator Boys intervinieron para intentar recuperar a Wally, pero hasta el lunes 29 de abril de 2024 todavía estaban recopilando información para rastrear la ubicación exacta de Wally.
Por ahora, continúa la búsqueda que intenta responder "¿Dónde está Wally?".

Article: Listo para votarse en Sala del Senado este jueves quedó el proyecto de nueva Ley Antiterrorista, que deroga la legislación vigente sobre la materia. Ello, luego que la Comisión de Constitución terminara en tiempo récord, pasadas las 20.00 horas, el estudio de las indicaciones presentadas a la iniciativa, en medio de la conmoción nacional por el asesinato a tres carabineros en Cañete (Región del Biobío).
La normativa actual data de 1984 y ha sido transversalmente cuestionada por su ineficaz definición de la conducta terrorista. "Suena (esta ley) a lo más severo que un país puede tener, pero en Chile se da la paradoja de que, por defectos en su redacción y porque está obsoleta -tiene más de 40 años-, juega un rol más simbólico más que práctico", explicó ayer el abogado Javier Couso, experto en derecho constitucional, a Cooperativa.
Durante la mañana de este martes, la comisión -que comenzó ayer a revisar el proyecto- avanzó en las definiciones de las penas y de lo que se entenderá por asociación terrorista, quedando pendiente para iniciar la sesión de la tarde la definición sobre los delitos cometidos en solitario y sin conexión, los denominados "lobos solitarios".
Tras la explicación de la ministra del Interior y Seguridad Pública, Carolina Tohá -quien se unió a la tramitación del proyecto tras regresar desde la Región del Biobío, donde participó en el funeral de uno de los tres carabineros asesinados- y del fiscal nacional, Ángel Valencia, la instancia se inclinó con cuatro votos a favor y uno en contra por mantener la figura del "lobo solitario", en el entendido que algunos atentados como el caso del envío de bombas a exautoridades fueron cometidas por personas que corresponden a esa figura.
Tal como sucedió en la sesión de la mañana, por la tarde hubo varias indicaciones que fueron rechazadas por estar ya contenidas en otras disposiciones, como la que proponía que no se apliquen penas sustitutivas a las privativas de libertad en estos casos, pues la mayoría de los delitos contenidos en esta ley no aplican para acceder a penas sustitutivas.
En tanto, se aprobó una disposición que aumenta las sanciones para los funcionarios públicos que, en el desempeño de su cargo, cometa cualquiera de los delitos contemplados en esta ley.
Uno de los temas que concitó debate dice relación con las normas que permiten a los fiscales solicitar autorización para intervenir una o más redes de servicios de telefonía o de transmisión de datos móviles mediante la operación de tecnologías. Los senadores Claudia Pascual y Daniel Núñez, ambos del Partido Comunista, presentaron una indicación para eliminar dicha norma, argumentando que raya en la inconstitucionalidad, mientras que el Ejecutivo sostuvo que le presentará indicaciones para acotarla.
Tras un intercambio de posturas, se optó por respaldar (con el voto en contra de Pascual) el texto tal como venía de la Comisión de Seguridad en el entendido que el Ejecutivo hará precisiones durante la tramitación.
Además se aprobó por mayoría, una norma que permite al Ministerio Público solicitar el traslado de las causas, previa autorización del pleno de la Corte Suprema cuando existan casos de especial complejidad o alarma pública.
TOHÁ CELEBRÓ "PRONTITUD Y TRABAJO SERIO"
Al término de la sesión la ministra del Interior agradeció el trabajo hecho por la comisión señalando que "aquí se ha buscado combinar la prontitud con un trabajo serio concentrado y sin desenfocarse".
En la misma línea, el presidente del Senado, José García (Renovación Nacional), señaló que "es un paso muy importante el que ha dado el Senado aprobando en particular el proyecto de ley que establece las conductas terroristas y su penalidad... Hemos sufrido mucho en estos últimos días, la muerte de estos tres carabineros nos ha impacto y no solo hay que lamentarlo, sino que tenemos la obligación de modernizar nuestra legislación y eso es lo que se ha logrado durante el trabajo de todo el día en la Comisión de Constitución".
Más temprano, el titular de la Cámara Alta relevó que no se trata de un "trámite apurado o que no tenga la rigurosidad que corresponde a un tema tan importante", pues la Comisión de Seguridad analizó previamente esta iniciativa. Agregó que la importancia es que "hoy y el jueves le demos al país una señal importante de que vamos a tener una ley antiterrorista moderna y eficaz".
"Retiré 14 indicaciones junto con la senadora Carmen Gloria Aravena (Partido Republicano). La verdad es que esas indicaciones lo que buscaban era precisar determinados aspectos jurídicos y yo he privilegiado que podamos tener este importantísimo proyecto para la tabla del jueves y por eso las he retirado. Además, como he señalado, los aspectos que pudieran no quedar perfectos lo podemos todavía reparar en el trámite de la Cámara de Diputados", indicó García.
Por su parte, el senador José Miguel Insulza (Partido Socialista), presidente accidental de la comisión, valoró el avance de esta normativa, señalando que "lo fundamental es que la ley define el delito de la asociación terrorista y eso permite acotar los cruces que se dan entre la legislación penal y la antiterrorista".
El parlamentario admitió previamente que "algunos de nosotros no éramos partidarios de ir demasiado rápido, pero las cosas, como están hoy día dentro del país... La gente espera reacción y probablemente esta sea la única ley que se despache a sala esta semana. Por eso estamos haciendo el esfuerzo por sacarla".
Mientras, la senadora Paulina Vodanovic (PS) destacó que "en lo sustantivo tenemos un cuerpo robusto que permite la investigación de delitos terroristas y crea figuras importantes como la del lobo solitario".
La iniciativa quedó así en condiciones de que sea votada este jueves en una sesión especial de Sala convocada para el efecto, tal como lo acordaron los comités el fin de semana.

Article: En el marco de la Ley Bases, Diputados le dio media sanción a las modificaciones, que incluyen subas, actualizaciones y prórrogas. Ahora se debatirá en el Senado.
En el marco de una maratónica sesión, la Cámara de Diputados le dio media sanción a las modificaciones del Monotributo incluidas en el paquete de la Ley Bases.
El proyecto del Gobierno Nacional incluye una actualización de los topes de facturación y cuotas, con subas de entre 300 y 330%.
Mientras que el ingreso tope anual sería de $68 millones y eliminaría la diferenciación entre actividades (comercio y servicios) para estar en el régimen simplificado.
Por su parte, subirían los montos de toda la escala y los importes a pagar y se agregó en el recinto una prórroga para el Monotributo Social que pidió un sector de la oposición.
Si se aprueba el proyecto en el Senado, los monotributistas de la categoría A, de menores ingresos, podrían facturar hasta $6.450.000 anuales. Para aquellos que se encuentren en la categoría K, la más alta, el monto ascendería a 68 millones de pesos.
Mientras que se acordó postergar por 90 días la eliminación del monotributo social para que en ese plazo el Gobierno y la oposición negocien una alternativa para incorporar una categoría inferior a la “A” en el régimen simplificado.
“Le agregaríamos un punto y seguido. Este artículo comenzará a regir a los 90 días a partir de su publicación en el Boletín Oficial”, leyó José Luis Espert, presidente de la Comisión de Presupuesto y Hacienda.
La Cámara de Diputados aprobó la Ley de Medidas Fiscales, Paliativas y Relevantes y a continuación se desarrolló luego la votación en particular del articulado.
Con 140 votos positivos, 103 negativos y 6 abstenciones, el Gobierno tiene su media sanción y ahora el debate se traslada al Senado.
La Libertad Avanza tuvo el apoyo del Pro, la UCR, Hacemos Coalición Federal, Innovación Federal y bloques minoritarios afines.
En cambio, Unión por la Patria, los cinco diputados del Frente de Izquierda y los dos socialistas santafesinos (Esteban Paulón y Mónica Fein) votaron en contra.
Este proyecto comprende la reversión del impuesto a las Ganancias, rebaja de Bienes Personales, moratoria tributaria, aduanera y de Seguridad Social, blanqueo de capitales, cambios en el régimen simplificado (incluye la eliminación del monotributo social), eliminación del Impuesto a la Transferencia de Inmuebles de Personas Físicas y Sucesiones Indivisas (ITI) y creación del Régimen de Transparencia Fiscal al Consumidor.
El diputado de Unión por la Patria Bernardo José Herrera fue sorprendido in fraganti hablando por teléfono en plena sesión cuando el presidente de la Cámara de Diputados, Martín Menem, estaba pidiendo a cada uno de los legisladores que no habían marcado su voto a través del sistema electrónico que aclararan su decisión en el capítulo sobre el impuesto al tabaco.
Cuando llegó el turno del santiagueño, éste estaba hablando por teléfono y la cámara lo ponchó en esa incómoda situación.
Varios legisladores desgranaron murmullos y risas, y la misma reacción tuvo Menem, sonriéndose por la insólita circunstancia que acababa de acontecer con Herrera.
La diputada Marcela Pagano reapareció en el recinto de la Cámara de Diputados, tras ser dada de alta de su internación la semana pasada por un cuadro gastrointestinal, luego de que en su entorno denunciaran "aprietes" por su fallida designación al frente de la comisión de Juicio Político.
Pagano arribó esta mañana temprano al Congreso de la Nación para la votación en general y particular de la ley de Bases. En un tuit, la legisladora y periodista lanzó: “A la gilada ni cabida”.

Article: Este lunes te contamos que quedó la escoba al interior de ¿Ganar o Servir?, luego de que se filtrara que Fabio Agostini, quien ingresó en tiempo real hace unos días al reality, debió renunciar tras una fuerte pelea con Luis Mateucci.
Desde Infama se encargaron de revelar esta información. «¿Recuerdan este episodio de ‘Tierra Brava’ donde Luis le escupe la Nutella a Fabio y después Fabio come de ella sin saber lo que hizo Luis? En este nuevo reality a Fabio le tocó ser sirviente de Luis, y le pagó con la misma moneda cuando le tocó servirle».
Pero la cosa no se queda ahí, pues al parecer el español no tuvo una mejor idea que escupirle agua a la cara a Mateucci, por lo que la producción le habría dado dos alternativas: pagar una multa en dinero o renunciar a ¿Ganar o Servir?, por lo que Fabio Agostini prefirió abandonar el reality.
Y esto no es todo, ya que de acuerdo al portal de farándula, esta situación «provocó que se formara una discusión que llegó a los golpes cuando Fabio le comentó que había tenido buena onda con Daniela Aránguiz estos últimos días».
Pamela Díaz se refiere a la polémica salida de Fabio Agostini
Es en este contexto que, desde FMDOS le consultaron a Pamela Díaz por esta situación, quien afirmó que encontró injusta la salida de Fabio Agostini, pues Luis Mateucci también se comportó de mala manera.
«Me parece injusto. Creo que cada canal se rige por un contrato y su línea editorial. Pero me parece que si alguien te tira un escupo a una Nutella, y te la comes, me imagino que es la misma multa que si alguien te lo hace en la cara, que también es una forma ordinaria, las dos. Horrible» señaló la Fiera.
Siguiendo por esta línea, Pamela Díaz aclaró que no llegaron a los golpes, pero que hubo provocación. «A mí me encantaría que volviera. Creo que, en esos tres, cuatro días que hizo, quedó la cagá. Pasó de todo».

Article: En el capítulo más reciente de ¿Ganar o Servir?, Claudio Valdivia sorprendió con sus revelaciones sobre la relación que tiene con su expareja y madre de su hijo, Sabrina Sosa, la que al parecer no estaría en los mejores términos.
Resulta que luego de confesar que se llevaba mal con la argentina, sus compañeros de encierro le preguntaron si esto afectaba a su retoño, frente a lo cual aseguró que «de hecho es mejor» y admitió que no tiene intención en arreglarse con ella.
Es en este contexto que, en conversación con La Hora, Claudio Valdivia habló más en específico de los motivos. «Nos llevamos mal. Sabrina, el año pasado, empezó a trabajar en un programa de farándula, ‘Me Late’, y lo mismo que la Daniela Aránguiz. Empezaron a hablar cosas que son íntimas».
Los motivos de la mala relación entre Claudio Valdivia y Sabrina Sosa
Siguiendo por esta línea, el hermano de Jorge Valdivia agregó: «Me acuerdo de tres cosas falsas. Una, que yo le debía la pensión. Eso es falso. A mí, ¿qué es lo que me molesta cuando las personas dicen algo en la televisión? Que no tienen pruebas de lo grave que están diciendo».
«Después voy y le digo, ‘¿por qué estás diciendo esto? ¿Por qué dijiste que la pensión es baja?’ Antes de que fuese el juicio, yo pagaba un millón trescientos. Le pagaba el colegio, le pagaba los estudios, le pagaba el gasto común. Y cuando sale el juicio, a mí me dice la jueza que yo tengo que pagar novecientas lucas», continuó.
«¿Por qué no dice las cosas buenas? ¿Por qué dice lo malo? Morbosa» afirmó Claudio Valdivia. Pero esto no es lo único, ya que el exfutbolista afirmó que cuando «Andrés Baile le pregunta ‘¿cómo es Claudio como papá?’, y ella dijo ‘prefiero no contestar’».
«Cuando llego a la casa y le digo ‘oye, ¿por qué no contestaste que yo soy un buen papá?’, porque soy presente, estoy con mi hijo. A veces cuando te vas de viaje estoy yo, porque te has ido varias veces de viaje. Y yo estoy aquí con mi hijo. No me corresponde algunos días y yo estoy acá» comentó.
Para cerrar, indicó: «Si te preguntan cómo es Claudio como pareja, me da igual lo que digas, di que soy infiel e inventa si quieres. Pero si te preguntan ¿cómo es como un papá? Dí que soy un buen papá, que soy presente».

Article: Estudiantes de La Plata dejó afuera a Boca en Córdoba, en la segunda semifinal de la Copa de la Liga Profesional. El Pincha fue superado durante más de una hora, pero un penal insólito de Cristian Lema le permitió igualar el partido e ir a penales. El arquero Matías Mansilla fue la gran figura atajando tres remates y el equipo de Eduardo Domínguez se metió en la final.
Una vez más, Estudiantes amargó al Xeneize, que había sido mejor futbolísticamente en la mayor parte del encuentro, pero no supo cómo liquidarlo y se quedó con las manos vacías. Salió mal la apuesta de Diego Martínez de poner suplentes en la Sudamericana y guardar titulares para el torneo local. En el primer tiempo, Arasa no cobró dos penales para Boca.
Estudiantes (LP): Matías Mansilla; Eros Mancuso, Luciano Lollo, Zaid Romero, Gastón Benedetti; Santiago Ascacibar, Enzo Pérez; Fernando Zuqui, José Sosa, Tiago Palacios; Guido Carrillo. DT: Eduardo Domínguez.
Boca: Sergio Romero; Luis Advíncula, Cristian Lema, Marcos Rojo, Lautaro Blanco; Guillermo Fernández, Cristian Medina, Ezequiel Fernández, Kevin Zenón; Miguel Merentiel y Edinson Cavani. DT: Diego Martínez.

Barras de Boca detenidos en la previa del partido
El líder de la barra brava de Boca, Rafael Di Zeo, fue detenido junto a otros 58 integrantes de ‘La 12’ en un control que la Policía de Córdoba realizó en el peaje de Toledo al micro que los trasladaba al estadio Mario Alberto Kempes para la semifinal ante Estudiantes por la Copa de la Liga. En el vehículo encontraron armas de fuego, alcohol, elementods punzantes y estupefacientes.
"En este momento el micro ya está bajo el control de la fiscalía. Van a ser imputados por la tenencia de armas de fuego, un delito que es agravado. Son imputados, no detenidos e inmediatamente se los carga en la Tribuna Segura. Una de las personas fue identificada por la policía como Rafael Di Zeo", aseguró el ministro de Seguridad de Córdoba, Juan Pablo Quinteros, una vez se detuvieron a los miembros de la barra brava de Boca.
"Es imposible que entre a la cancha", agregó Quinteros con respecto al duelo por las semifinales de la Copa de la Liga entre Estudiantes y el club xeneize en el estadio Mario Alberto Kempes. Solo a uno de los detenidos se le encontró el armamento pero todo el grupo quedó imputado y sin poder asistir al encuentro.
Los involucrados fueron inicialmente acusados de posesión de armas de fuego. Según la declaración del organismo provincial, todos los participantes fueron identificados y se los incluyó en el programa Tribuna Segura por lo que no se les permitió viajar al Kempes y también se les prohibió participar como espectadores en eventos deportivos a futuro.
Durante la búsqueda, los agentes encontraron armas de fuego debajo de los asientos, en las lámparas del micro y en el suelo. Las pistolas y demás elementos viajaban envueltos en medias o ropa de los detenidos para evitar ser detectados a simple vista por los controles.
Además, la ministra de Seguridad de la Nación, Patricia Bullrich, notificó el hecho por su cuenta oficial de la red social X y destacó el trabajo policial: “A LA CANCHA CON ARMAS, NO 60 pasajeros de un ómnibus con hinchas de Boca, entre ellos el barrabrava Di Zeo, fueron derecho a la comisaría por llevar armas, drogas y elementos punzantes. @MinSeg y @minsegcba garantizan la seguridad en el partido. El que las hace, las paga”.

Article: El diputado provincial junto a su par Martín Rosúa y otros legisladores, presentaron un proyecto de Ley para modificar el Código Procesal Penal y agregar la reiterancia delictiva. “Si un detenido fue condenado por un delito y no transcurrió el doble de tiempo de esa pena, o si en el momento de la detención está imputado en otro delito; debe quedar en prisión preventiva. Eso determina nuestra iniciativa”, detalló el legislador provincial.
El diputado provincial Dionisio Scarpin, junto con sus pares Martín Rosúa, Ariel Bermúdez, Fernanda Castellani, Germán Scavuzzo, Ximena García y Ximena Sola; presentaron un proyecto de Ley para modificar el Código Procesal Penal y determinar la prisión preventiva para quienes hayan incurrido en la “reiterancia delictiva”. “El objetivo es que, si una persona es detenida y tiene una causa judicial abierta en la que está imputado, espere su proceso en prisión”, explicó Dionisio Scarpin.
Además, agregó que con esta iniciativa “buscamos brindar herramientas para que la sociedad viva en paz, porque hablamos de personas que de manera reiterada son culpables o investigados por delitos, y siguen sus procesos en libertad”. En ese sentido, el legislador provincial precisó que con el objetivo de “evitar la puerta giratoria”, se agregaron dos incisos al Artículo 221 del Código Procesal Penal, que define la “Peligrosidad procesal”.
En el inciso 9) se establece como circunstancia de fuga o entorpecimiento de la investigación: “Que el imputado tenga una condena anterior total o parcialmente cumplida en un proceso judicial, salvo que haya transcurrido, desde el cumplimiento de la condena, un término igual al de la impuesta en dicho proceso, en cuyo caso no podrá tenerse en cuenta este apartado”. En tanto, el inciso 10) estipula como elemento de “Peligrosidad procesal”: “Que el imputado hubiera incurrido en reiterancia delictiva, por existir alguna otra imputación a través de audiencia imputativa en uno o varios procesos judiciales aún en trámite, por la eventual comisión de delitos dolosos”.
“En muchos casos se les otorga la libertad a personas imputadas o con condenas anteriores, y usan esta libertad para volver a delinquir. Lo que buscamos es poner a la sociedad por encima de quien está repitiendo el delito”, afirmó Dionisio Scarpin.

Article: Había clima de final en las tribunas del Mario Kempes y los jugadores no defraudaron y brindaron un espectáculo a la altura de las circunstancias. Y en el apasionante Boca- Estudiantes, al minuto de juego la primera aproximación fue para los platenses. Guido Carrillo recibió un centro preciso, pero su cabezazo fue directamente al cuerpo de Sergio Romero. De todas formas, minutos después, cuando el equipo de Diego Martínez se acomodó se adueñó del juego.
Un poco por jerarquía individual, otro poco por funcionamiento, Boca fue muy superior a un “pincha” muy timorato. Las claves de ese primer tiempo fueron los laterales “xeneizes” y Ezequiel Fernández, con un trabajo descomunal en el medio, luchando, quitando y jugando. Eduardo Domínguez propuso un medio combativo con cinco volantes, encabezados por Santiago Ascacibar y Enzo Pérez.
Además de algunos lujos y de la pierna fuerte, también hubo algunos encontronazos, como por ejemplo Fernando Zuqui con Edinson Cavani quedaron frente a frente, luego de una disputa que había finalizado con una infracción del uruguayo. De todas formas, la primera polémica llegó a los 23 minutos.
Tras un lateral, Cristian Medina se posteó para recibir la pelota sobre la línea y Pérez lo tomó desde atrás. Ambos cayeron y Nazareno Arasa no dudó en cobrar tiro libre. Luego de algunos minutos de incertidumbre, se leyó en los labios del árbitro: "yo la vi, fue afuera", dijo y ordenó que se reanudara el juego.
Minutos después Matías Mansilla frustró un tiro libre de Kevin Zenón y Miguel Merentiel pegó un mano a mano con el arquero en el palo. Luego de ver su primera gran chance no traducirse en el primer grito de la noche por impactar en el poste, en la siguiente la “Bestia” no perdonó y permitió a Boca irse al descanso arriba en el marcador gracias a su definición de volea.
Fue una gran jugada colectiva “xeneize” sobre la banda derecha entre Zenón, Medina y Advíncula terminó en el envío del lateral peruano que Merentiel aprovechó para definir con calidad. El buen primer tiempo del equipo se traducía en el marcador parcial.
En el segundo tiempo el partido perdió intensidad y Boca, peligrosamente, se conformó con un resultado que podría haber sido más abultado, pero el 1-0 mantenía con vida a los de Domínguez. Inteligentemente, y presionado por el resultado y el reloj, el DT del “pincha” realizó variantes para adelantar al equipo. De esta forma, los ingresos de Edwin Cetré y Eric Meza fueron claves, el equipo se adelantó y comenzó a merodear el área de “Chiquito”, aunque sin demasiado peligro.
En ese momento, cuando Estudiantes amenazaba el triunfo parcial “xeneize”, fue Cristian Lema el que solucionó todos los problemas de los platenses. Tras un buen centro de Meza, el central de Boca levantó peligrosamente la pierna, despejó la pelota y luego su botín impactó en la cabeza de Matías Palacios, penal y roja para el defensor por doble amonestación. Cetré convirtió y el 1-1 no se modificó en el marcador.
Boca hizo correr los minutos para llegar a los penales, en tanto que Domínguez mandó a la cancha a varios delanteros para tratar de hacer valer la supremacía numérica.
En los penales, los arqueros comenzaron luciéndose, Mansilla le tapó el disparo a Cavani, en tanto que Romero hizo lo propio con el de Cetré. Merentiel le apuntó al travesaño y recién en el cuarto penal Eros Mancuso puso el 1-0 en la definición.
Zenón y Carrillo vencieron a los arqueros, en tanto que Nicolás Figal no pudo con Mansilla (héroe de la serie) y Mauro Méndez sí pudo engañar a "Chiquito" para el 3-1 definitivo para que el "pincha" llegue a la final, en donde ya esperaba el "fortín", que también derrotó por penales a Argentinos.

Article: "¡El Congreso de los Diputados es un nido de ratas!", bramó el presidente argentino Javier Milei el febrero pasado, después de que la Cámara rechazara su 'ley ómnibus' de reducción del Estado y desregulación de la economía. Y por si quedaban dudas arremetió: "(Los diputados) son unos mierdas y la gente los desprecia".
La llamada 'ley ómnibus' llevaba ese nombre porque contenía 664 artículos y pretendía reformar casi todo en Argentina. Desde ceder poderes legislativos al presidente durante dos años prorrogables a todo el mandato, hasta privatizar 41 empresas públicas, pasando por prohibir que más de tres personas se manifestaran en la calle y detenerlas si no cesaban en su actitud.
Pero ese gran plan de reformas chocó de bruces con la realidad: el bloque 'mileista' de diputados es minoría, cuenta con sólo 38 escaños de los 257 en total, y aquella vez no consiguió tejer alianzas con otros grupos. En consecuencia, la 'ley ómnibus' fue rechazada por la mayoría de los legisladores, lo cual desató la cólera mencionada del mandatario anarcocapitalista.
Entonces el Gobierno tomó nota y encogió el proyecto recortando 441 artículos, sobre todo las medidas más radicales. Sólo quedaron en pie 223 artículos en la denominada 'ley combi', descafeinada y menos pretenciosa respecto a la anterior. Y la presentó la semana pasada a un nuevo debate en el Congreso de los Diputados.
Ayer martes, una mayoría inédita de diputados aprobó, por 142 votos a favor, 106 en contra y cinco abstenciones, la 'ley combi', llamada formalmente "Ley de Bases y Puntos de Partida para La Libertad de los Argentinos". Ha sido el primer triunfo parlamentario de Milei tras casi cinco meses en la Casa Rosada, desde el 10 de diciembre pasado.
"Este es un primer paso fundamental para sacar a Argentina del pantano que ha sido las últimas décadas. Quiero agradecer la enorme tarea de todos los diputados que, entendiendo el momento histórico, decidieron acompañar nuestro proyecto", ha posteado el presidente en las redes sociales.
El bloque de La Libertad Avanza de Milei consiguió la mayoría gracias al respaldo de diputados de Propuesta Republicana (derecha, del expresidente Mauricio Macri, 2015-2019), Unión Cívica Radical (centroderecha), y Hacemos Coalición Federal (peronistas de centroderecha).
Claves de la 'ley combi'
La 'ley combi' declara, entre otros aspectos, que Argentina se encuentra "en emergencia" en asuntos administrativos, económicos, financieros y energéticos, por lo cual cede poderes legislativos en dichas materias al presidente, que podrá dictar decretos y resolver cuestiones estratégicas sorteando al poder legislativo.
En materia laboral, flexibiliza los contratos de trabajo, extendiendo el período de prueba de tres meses a un año y permite a las pymes fichar hasta cinco trabajadores en condición de autónomos como "colaboradores". También rebaja la indemnización en caso de despido sin causa y amnistía a las empresas con trabajadores 'en negro'.
En cuestiones tributarias, rebaja hasta 89% el impuesto al patrimonio a los ricos y autoriza el blanqueo sin multa de dinero y bienes por valor de hasta 93.000 euros que hayan estado ocultos al fisco. A la vez, restituye el impuesto a la renta a los salarios brutos superiores a 1.600 euros y sube la cotización a los trabajadores por cuenta propia.
La Administración Nacional de la Seguridad Social (ANSES), por su parte, no admitirá más las solicitudes de jubilaciones por los trabajadores que hayan cotizado menos de 30 años, sólo les concederá una pensión no contributiva. En el caso de las mujeres se elevará la edad para la jubilación cinco años más, de 60 a 65 años.
A los grandes inversores –más de 197 millones de euros- que quieran venir a hacer negocios en Argentina les da la bienvenida con exenciones impositivas y aduaneras durante los próximos 30 años hasta 2054. También les da vía libre para que importen maquinaria e insumos y enviar utilidades a sus casas matrices.
Respecto a las privatizaciones, de las 41 empresas públicas vendibles que había en la 'ley ómnibus' sólo han quedado cuatro: Aerolíneas Argentinas (ex Iberia y ex Marsans), Radio y Televisión Argentina (equivalente a RTVE), Energía Argentina SA ( dedicada a la exploración hidrocarburífera), e Intercargo (servicio de rampa aérea).
Otras siete compañías del Estado podrán ser concesionadas o asociarse a capitales privados: Aguas Argentinas (ex Aguas de Barcelona), Correo Argentino, Sociedad Operadora Ferroviaria, tren Belgrano Cargas, Corredores Viales, Nucleoeléctrica Argentina SA, Yacimientos Carboníferos Río Turbio (ex Isolux Corsan).
Críticas y protestas
La reacción más fuerte entre los opositores a la 'ley combi' provino de los sindicatos del transporte. Convocaron a una huelga para el lunes 6 de mayo en autobuses, metro, trenes, y aerolíneas. Por su parte, las centrales sindicales CGT, CTA y CTA autónoma ya habían convocado antes a un paro nacional el jueves 9 de mayo.
El gobernador de la provincia de Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, que se perfila para 2027 como presidenciable por la oposición, también saltó al ruedo. "La ley sienta las bases para desintegrar el Estado y que impere la ley de la selva Entrega –sentenció- a los jubilados, a la clase media, a los trabajadores, a los pequeños productores, a las pymes, para beneficiar al puñado más rico y poderoso".
La imagen positiva de Milei sigue elevada, entre 52,6 y 48,3%, según las últimas encuestas de CB y Analogías, respectivamente. Pero la imagen negativa también es alta y se sostiene entre 45,1 y 47,3%, seguramente empujada por el récord de IPC acumulado de 107% en cinco meses y el desplome de la economía estimado en 15% interanual.
Ahora resta saber qué pasará con la 'ley combi' en el Senado, donde debería obtener la sanción total o, tal vez, podría ser rechazada. El Gobierno cuenta sólo con 7 de los 72 senadores y tendrá que tejer nuevas alianzas. "Que la grandeza vista hoy en Diputados se reproduzca prontamente en el Senado", ha posteado el Presidente.

Article: Ciudad Juárez.- Con una diversidad de temas que les preocupan a los socios de la Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Canacintra) en Juárez, así recibieron a Rogelio Loya, candidato a la alcaldía por la coalición Fuerza y Corazón por México que integran los partidos PAN, PRI y PRD.
Isela Molina, presidenta del organismo, le dio la bienvenida al aspirante a la alcaldía, así como a su equipo de trabajo y le recordó que este organismo busca ser un aliado para el gobierno y deseó que, en caso de llegar a la Presidencia, vuelva a la Cámara para tratar de llegar a compromisos, como se ha planteado con cada uno de los candidatos que han acudido a Canacintra.
El político fue invitado a escuchar la exposición de cada uno de los socios presentes en temas como recolección y disposición de basura, uso de concreto hidráulico en la pavimentación, relocalización de las industrias Centro Histórico y el proyecto de construcción del puente por parte de Ferromex en la avenida Vicente Guerrero, en estos dos últimos puntos hubo bastante insistencia entre los industriales.
La falta de banquetas, el descuido de los parques, camellones la falta de paradas de camiones, contaminación visual y auditiva, así como también la necesidad del fortalecimiento del enlace binacional con el empresariado, los proyectos de movilidad y la tramitología, también fueron temas expuestos ante el político.
Rogelio Loya reconoció la diversidad de temas que le preocupan a los empresarios, así como destacó que muchos de ellos tienen una raíz, la falta de arraigo de los habitantes de Juárez con la ciudad.
“Son muchos, muchos temas, muchos coinciden en que no hay arraigo en la ciudad, y yo estoy muy metido en ese tema de cómo generar un arraigo en la ciudad, muchas de las cosas que ustedes platicaron, la inseguridad, la basura, muchas vienen de ahí, de ahí dependen”, expuso el político.
Al final tanto el candidato a la alcaldía Rogelio Loya, como Isela Molina presidenta de la Cámara, firmaron el compromiso con Canacintra para que los temas que se expusieron durante el encuentro se vuelvan a tratar, con la expectativa de volver a platicarlos en caso de triunfar en los comicios del próximo 2 de junio.

Article: Signos
Cuando se habla de miedo social se habla de algo más allá del que imponen las guerras del narcoterror. Se habla de la indefensión absoluta de las poblaciones y de su noción convencida de que la autoridad política y sus liderazgos principales y subordinados y complementarios (policiales, ministeriales y jurisdiccionales) no están para cumplir con sus obligaciones constitucionales y representativas mayores que son, en principio, las de defenderla, las de garantizarle seguridad, y las de combatir, por tanto, la delincuencia, castigar a los delincuentes, y acabar con la impunidad que los ampara y los torna reincidentes.
Cuando se habla del temor social que impone el narcoterror, se habla, en consecuencia, del que siente la autoridad responsable de garantizar la seguridad y la justicia frente a los grupos y liderazgos del narcoterror, de su propia indefensión, de su cobardía, y de su consecuente docilidad, sometimiento o complicidad y asociación con ellos, lo que se denomina narcoGobiernos o, cuando se incluyen todos los mandos institucionales, narcoEstados.
Cuando se miente con absoluto descaro desde lo más alto de la autoridad del Estado y se niega la evidencia más objetiva de la criminalidad que se expande y que se advierte y truena en la cotidianidad de Chetumal y se hace normalidad, del mismo modo, en todas las ciudades del Caribe mexicano, y se empeoran las versiones con el cinismo oficial de que se trata sólo de incidentes aislados y enfrentamientos entre grupos armados del Cártel de Sinaloa y el de Caborca por el mercado fronterizo de las drogas pero eso no atenta contra la población ni afecta las condiciones de seguridad del entorno, entonces estamos hablando de un perfecto narcoEstado que favorece con justa razón el miedo de las poblaciones caribes que se saben indefensas y del lado enemigo de la autoridad acobardada o cómplice del narcoterror que está dispuesta a mentir sin el menor escrúpulo y a enseñar el cobre de su perfecta ilegitimidad.
Y cuando por tres pesos se silencia o se pervierte el entorno político, electoral y mediático en favor de las versiones canallas del narcoEstado, entonces la normalidad del crimen será la normalidad de la opinión pública bajo el mando irrevocable del narcoterror.

Article: El Xeneize fue perjudicado por el arbitraje de Arasa, que no sancionó las infracciones sobre Medina y Merentiel durante el primer tiempo de la semifinal.
Boca quedó afuera con Estudiantes de La Plata por penales. Cuando el partido estaba empatado sin goles, hubo dos errores graves el equipo arbitral que incidieron en el resultado de la segunda semifinal de la Copa de la Liga Profesional. El Xeneize fue claramente superior y generó las mejores opciones, pero después se lo empataron y terminó quedando afuera.
Fueron dos jugadas discutidas en las que el árbitro Nazareno Arasa no cobró las infracciones sobre los jugadores xeneizes dentro del área rival.
La primera llegó pisando los 23' de la etapa inicial, cuando Enzo Pérez le cometió clara infracción a Cristian Medina. El juez sancionó correctamente la falta, pero la dio afuera del área. En la repetición se lo ve al futbolista de Estudiantes sobre la línea de cal, con lo cual era pertinente marcar la pena máxima. Desde el VAR, Fernando Espinoza evaluó la acción, pero consideró que no era para llamar a su colega que estaba en el campo.
La segunda acción fue tras un pase quirúrgico de Equi Fernández para Miguel Merentiel. El uruguayo le ganó la espalda a Zaid Romero y Benedetti, para definir por encima de la salida de Matías Mansilla. El balón superó al arquero, que se llevó puesto al delantero de Boca, cometiéndole clara infracción. En el rebote, Edinson Cavani no pudo empujar el balón y Arasa no cobró nada.
El jugador del xeneize tardó en levantarse, intentando estirar el momento para que fuera chequeado por el equipo arbitral mientras el balón se iba al lateral sobre el lado opuesto. Otra vez, Fernando Espinoza desde el VAR dijo "siga, siga".
Rafa Di Zeo no pudo entrar con la barra
El líder de la barra brava de Boca, Rafael Di Zeo, fue detenido junto a otros 58 integrantes de ‘La 12’ en un control que la Policía de Córdoba realizó en el peaje de Toledo al micro que los trasladaba al estadio Mario Alberto Kempes para la semifinal ante Estudiantes por la Copa de la Liga.

En primera instancia, a Pérez se lo vio festejar el penal y la expulsión de Lema, arengó a la gente y luego se abrazó en el grito de gol de Cetré. En la tanda de penales no ejecutó, pero celebró subiéndose a los carteles de publicidad y revoleando su camiseta.
En ese momento, las cámaras enfocaron el enorme escudo de River que tiene en su espalda, junto a la imagen de una virgen. Las imágenes rápidamente se viralizaron en las redes sociales.

Article: La protesta ‘Encampment Solidarity for Gaza’ desafía nuevamente las expectativas de la administración universitaria. En la madrugada del martes 30 de abril, los alumnos asaltaron el Hamilton Hall, llamado así en honor de Alexander Hamilton –uno de los cinco ‘padres fundadores’ de Estados Unidos–, de la Universidad de Columbia. Y, en las primeras horas del día, desplegaron una bandera palestina junto a una pancarta que disponía 'Hinder's Hall', renombrando el edificio en honor de un niño, Hind Rajab, que murió con seis años de edad en Gaza a causa de un ataque israelí, según informó la prensa estudiantil de The Spectator.
Horas después, los alumnos de Columbia fueron notificados de que los "protestantes han decidido escalar la situación", vandalizando la propiedad universitaria y rompiendo puertas y ventanas. Así, la institución amenazó a los estudiantes que ocuparon el edificio con la expulsión. "Esto no es por responder a la causa de la protesta, sino a las acciones", señala el correo que fue enviado a los estudiantes y a la que tuvo acceso EL ESPAÑOL.
La presidenta de la universidad, Minouche Shafik, anunció previamente que Columbia no iba a ceder antes las peticiones de los manifestantes y que la universidad no iba a "desinvertir en Israel", indicando que las negociaciones entre la administración universitaria y los grupos de Columbia University for Apartheid Diversity, Students for Justice in Palestine y Jewish Voice for Peace, fallaron.
El correo, según comenta la prensa estudiantil, aunque también fue publicado en una sucesión de historias de Columbia University for Apartheid Diversity (CUAD) en Instagram, señalaba que “no queremos privar a estudiantes y a sus familias y a sus amigos de tener una ceremonia de graduación”, ya que muchos no tuvieron ceremonia por la pandemia y explica que otros son la primera generación de sus familias en ir o graduarse de un grado universitario.
Adam Lehoday (23 años), estudiante del programa dual (de la Universidad de Columbia y la universidad francesa Sciences Politique) de Economía y Filosofía comparte con EL ESPAÑOL, que es "triste" que cancelen la ceremonia de graduación, ya que “su primer año fue online. No tuvieron el primer año en persona y ahora no saben si van a tener la graduación en persona tampoco porque la situación ha empeorado".
Recuerda que ha habido protestas en el campus desde noviembre, pero no eran “violentas”, simplemente el ambiente era “un poco tenso”. El clima de las manifestaciones se incrementó cuando Shafik fue llamada a Washington para que renunciara a su puesto. Al día siguiente los activistas estudiantes montaron el ‘Encampment Solidarity for Gaza’.
Los manifestantes exigen, entre otras cosas, que haya desinversión financiera con instituciones y compañías que se benefician del "apartheid isrealí, del genocidio y de la ocupación en Palestina"; y un boicot académico, que incluye cortar lazos con instituciones académicas en Israel, así como la Central Global en Tel Aviv (y el programa dual que tienen con al Universidad de Tel Aviv).
Según Lehoday, la universidad les notificó en cinco diferentes ocasiones antes de autorizar los 108 arrestos por parte de la policía neoyorquina. Asimismo, comenta que la urgencia para que se desmantele el campamento se debe a que las ceremonias de graduación comenzarán en dos semanas y "hay muchas cosas que preparar para que quede listo".
Un asalto preavisado
Uno de los grupos que lidera la protesta, Columbia University for Apartheid Diversity, mandó el lunes por la tarde afirmó que tanto la universidad como el gobierno federal y de la ciudad de Nueva York querían acabar con la protesta. Mediante amenazas, la administración tiene el objetivo de "suprimir el movimiento estudiantil para Palestina", señaló.
Avisando a través de un post en Instagram, los activistas estudiantiles dieron a conocer que tenían planeado ocupar el Hamilton Hall. Este icónico edificio también fue ocupado por estudiantes en las protestas o 'movimientos estudiantiles' de 1968, 1985, 1996 y, ahora, 2024. Los ‘activistas’ estudiantiles iban preparados con bolsas para dormir, mochilas con provisiones y muchos tenían postes (piquetes) de maderas, poniendo barricadas de metal negro, mientras que a su vez, se apresuraban hacia el edificio.
La prensa estudiantil de la universidad, The Spectator, quienes tienen permitido entrar a todas horas a la protesta, a diferencia del resto de medios de comunicación, que sólo tienen permitido ir en el horario entre las 2:00 y 4:00 pm, compartió que una vez que los protestantes entraron, dejaron sus pertenencias y se fueron corriendo a las escaleras, “trayendo con ellos mesas y sillas de las aulas para bloquear las puertas desde adentro”.
Pensaron en todo. “Cubrieron las cámaras de seguridad con bolsas de basura y cinta y cerraron las persianas”, acciones que podrían compararse con una producción estelar de Hollywood. Una vez tomado, varios asaltantes afirmaron en Instagram que el edificio había sido "liberado" y otros señalaron que "sólo hay una solución: Revolución estudiantil", una consigna similar a la de Rebelión en la granja de George Orwell.
Unas manifestaciones "destructivas"
Para Lehodey, las manifestaciones han sido "destructivas" para el funcionamiento de las clases. "Hay reglas para poder manifestarse porque también hay otros estudiantes que pagan mucho dinero para poder estudiar allí [es una universidad cara] y es difícil”, cuenta, sobre todo para los estudiantes extranjeros.
Además, añade que el Encampment Solidarity for Gaza no está abierto a dialogar, como fue el caso del ‘Comité Palestine de Sciences Po’ (en la universidad francesa), y para él, el objetivo de hacer manifestaciones es fomentar la discusión.
La policía de Nueva York llegó a la avenida de Ámsterdam afuera del campus alrededor de las 12:45 de la mañana y dos horas después fue cuestionado por un miembro de The Spectator si entrarían al campus. Su respuesta, sencilla, indicó que lo harían sólo si “escuchan que alguien se encontraba herido”.
En conversación con EL ESPAÑOL, Isha Banerjee (19 años) y Claire Cleary (20 años), ambas periodistas de The Spectator, usan sus pases de prensa cada vez que entran en el campamento o están presentes en alguna protesta. “Es lo que nos mantiene a salvo”, cuenta Banerjee. “También nos diferencia de los protestantes y miembros del campamento”.
“Saben que estamos aquí pero que no estamos participando, obviamente estamos cubriendo, y así no se confunde ningún tipo de conflicto de interés”, indica Banerjee, señalando que a los estudiantes que les incomoda hablar con los periodistas, no hablan con aquellos que no llevan puesta la identificación.
Lehodey comparte que los alumnos que no viven en el campus tienen que asistir a clases en línea forzosamente. No obstante, explica que existe la opción híbrida, ya que no tienen permitido entrar a la universidad por la toma de Hamilton Hall. Cuenta que es difícil concentrarse online y no hay el ambiente social de las clases presenciales.
Además, la universidad está siendo precavida con su imagen en cuanto al antisemitismo para que Shafik no sufra el mismo destino que los antiguos rectores de las universidades de Harvard y Pensilvania en diciembre de 2023.
Los activistas estudiantiles se niegan a dejar el campus si la universidad no participa en el movimiento. Sin embargo, el problema es que si decide participar, podría enfrentarse a grandes problemas legales. En virtud de la 'Ley Orden Ejecutiva 157', aquellas entidades que apoyen la campaña de boicots, desinversiones y sanciones contra Israel en el estado de Nueva York perderían los fondos públicos.

Article: Varios centenares de opositores se manifestaron este martes frente al Parlamento de Georgia para protestar contra la aprobación de la "ley de agentes extranjeros" promovida por el Gobierno y que la oposición denuncia como una copia de la normativa que se emplea en Rusia para acallar a la disidencia.
Los manifestantes intentaron bloquear la sede del legislativo, fuertemente custodiada por fuerzas antidisturbios, que recurrieron al empleo de gases lacrimógenos para dispersar a los participantes.
"¡No a la ley rusa!", "¡Georgia!", coreaban los manifestantes, que lanzaron huevos a los efectivos policiales.
Los opositores también intentaron bloquear la sede del Gobierno, pero no lo consiguieron debido a la acción de las fuerzas antidisturbios.
El ministerio del Interior emitió una declaración advirtiendo a los manifestantes de que bloquear los edificios de la administración pública y obstaculizar la labor de esta son acciones ilegales y, por tanto, serán perseguidas por la policía. Además, hizo un llamamiento la ciudadanía a manifestarse pacíficamente en el marco de la ley.
La "ley rusa" está actualmente en fase de estudio en el Parlamento y su nombre oficial es "ley de transparencia de la influencia extranjera". Es probable que el Parlamento, controlado por Sueño Georgiano y sus aliados, apruebe el proyecto de ley, que debe pasar dos lecturas más antes de convertirse en ley. Los legisladores finalizaron la sesión del martes sin votación y el debate se reanudará el miércoles.
El proyecto de ley exigiría que las organizaciones que reciban más del 20% de su financiación del extranjero se registren como "agentes extranjeros".
Además de por su parecido a la legislación de Moscú que se utiliza para reprimir a la disidencia, muchos georgianos se oponen a este proyecto porque lo consideran un acercamiento a Rusia, que apoya a las regiones separatistas de Abjasia y Osetia del Sur.
Otra manifestación, a favor
La concentración de hoy sucedió a la que celebraron el lunes los partidarios del Gobierno y que congregó a decenas de miles de personas en la capital georgiana que sí apoyan el proyecto de ley.
En esa manifestación, el ex primer ministro Bidzina Ivanishvili, un multimillonario que fundó Georgian Dream, criticó duramente a Occidente e insinuó una represión postelectoral contra la oposición.
Según Reuters, Ivanishvili dijo a los asistentes que un "partido de guerra global" se había apropiado de la UE y la OTAN y que estaba empeñado en utilizar esas instituciones para socavar la soberanía de Georgia.
Ivanishvili, que dice que quiere que Georgia se una a la UE, declaró que la ley sobre agentes extranjeros reforzaría la soberanía nacional y sugirió que la oposición pro occidental del país estaba controlada por servicios de inteligencia extranjeros a través de subvenciones a ONG.
Añadió que después de las elecciones previstas para octubre, la oposición de Georgia, dominada por el partido Movimiento Nacional Unido del ex presidente Mikheil Saakashvili, enfrentaría "el duro juicio político y legal que merece".

Article: Mientras Egipto, figura central en la mediación del conflicto en Gaza, aguarda con expectación el regreso de Hamás a la mesa de negociaciones en El Cairo para responder a la propuesta de tregua presentada por Israel, se han desarrollado importantes movimientos diplomáticos fuera de la región. Representantes de Hamás, el grupo gobernante en la Franja, han mantenido un encuentro con sus contrapartes de Fatah (también conocido como al-Fatah) en Pekín, en un esfuerzo por explorar una posible reconciliación, según anunció el martes el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores chino.
"Los representantes del Movimiento de Liberación Nacional Palestino y del Grupo de Resistencia Islámica llegaron a Pekín hace unos días para mantener un diálogo profundo y sincero", declaró el portavoz del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores chino, Lin Jian, en una rueda de prensa, aunque no especificó la fecha exacta de la reunión. Las dos facciones palestinas, añadió, expresaron plenamente su "voluntad política de lograr la reconciliación a través del diálogo y la consulta, discutieron muchos asuntos específicos y lograron avances positivos”.
Asimismo, indicó Lin, “acordaron continuar con el curso de las conversaciones para lograr la realización de la solidaridad y la unidad palestinas en una fecha próxima”, señalando que ambas partes habían agradecido a Pekín sus esfuerzos para “promover la unidad interna palestina y llegaron a un acuerdo sobre la continuación del diálogo”.
China ha simpatizado históricamente con la causa palestina y ha sido un firme defensor de la solución de los dos estados. Desde el inicio de la contienda tras el atentado perpetrado por Hamás en territorio israelí, el presidente chino, Xi Jinping, ha pedido en numerosas ocasiones la celebración de una conferencia de paz internacional para resolver los enfrentamientos y ha solicitado varias veces un alto el fuego inmediato en la Franja de Gaza.
La reunión se produce un mes después de que ambos grupos mantuvieran conversaciones similares en Moscú en marzo, donde junto a otras facciones palestinas debatieron la guerra entre Israel y Hamás en Gaza, y los planes de gobierno para una eventual posguerra. También acordaron continuar con su diálogo para lograr la unidad nacional con la participación de todas las fuerzas palestinas dentro del marco de la Organización para la Liberación de Palestina (OLP), según informó DW.
Ambos grupos han competido durante años para obtener el control de Palestina, sin embargo, el inicio de la ofensiva israelí en la Franja de Gaza tras los atentados del 7 de octubre ha provocado nuevas conversaciones sobre la reconciliación palestina. Las tensiones entre Fatah y Hamás han dominado la política palestina desde el año 2006, cuando el segundo ganó las últimas elecciones parlamentarias de la Autoridad Palestina al Consejo Legislativo Palestino, poniendo fin al dominio de Fatah.
Las dos facciones se enzarzaron entonces en un breve (pero sangriento) conflicto armado tras los comicios y, tras un intento de gobierno de unidad nacional, Palestina ha estado dividida en dos. Hamás gobierna de facto en Gaza desde 2007 tras expulsar a su rival del enclave por su negativa a reconocer el resultado de los comicios, mientras que la Autoridad Palestina, dirigida por Fatah, gobierna en Cisjordania.
Una división histórica
Hamás fue fundado en Gaza en 1987 por un imán, el jeque Ahmed Yasin, y su ayudante Abdul Aziz al-Rantissi, poco después de que comenzara la primera Intifada, una revuelta violenta contra la ocupación israelí en la Franja y en Cisjordania que se extendió durante varios años. El movimiento surgió como la rama palestina de los Hermanos Musulmanes de Egipto y, al poco tiempo, creó un brazo militar, las Brigadas Izz al-Din al-Qassam, para llevar a cabo una lucha armada contra Israel con el objetivo de liberar la Palestina histórica.
Por su parte, Fatah, fundado en 1959 por el expresidente Yasser Arafat y otros activistas palestinos, es el mayor partido político palestino secular y la fuerza impulsora detrás de la OLP (Organización para la Liberación de Palestina) y la Autoridad Palestina. Si bien este grupo se enfrentó a Israel militarmente al principio, en los años 80, comenzó a tantear la vía diplomática que finalmente condujeron a los Acuerdos de Oslo de 1993 y a la propuesta de solución al conflicto a través del establecimiento de dos estados. Este acercamiento nunca agradó a Hamás.
A diferencia de la OLP, Hamás no reconoce la condición de Estado de Israel, aunque acepta un Estado palestino con las fronteras anteriores a la guerra de los Seis Días de 1967. En dicha contienda, Israel aumentó considerablemente su territorio, al incorporar la mayor parte de los Altos del Golán, Cisjordania (incluyendo Jerusalén Oriental), la Franja de Gaza y la península del Sinaí. "No renunciaremos a ni un centímetro del suelo patrio palestino, sean cuales sean las presiones recientes y dure lo que dure la ocupación", declaró en 2017 Jaled Meshaal, líder político en el exilio de Hamás.
Tanto Hamás como Fatah buscan construir un solo Estado palestino, aunque sus visiones son muy diferentes. Mientras Fatah está abierto a negociar con los israelíes y a participar en foros internacionales, Hamás prefiere utilizar la vía armada para luchar contra la ocupación israelí de los territorios palestinos y crear un Estado islámico. Desde la guerra civil de 2007, estas diferencias han sido irreconciliables.
“Es como una pareja que está a punto de divorciarse. La mitad del tiempo, hablan de reunirse, y la otra mitad, hablan de matarse el uno al otro”, explicó James Gelvin, catedrático de Historia Moderna de Oriente Próximo en la Universidad de California en Los Ángeles (UCLA), en una entrevista para la radio estadounidense NPR.

Article: Horas antes de que el juez lo multara con 9.000 dólares por el caso Stormy Daniels, Donald Trump ya presidía la cabecera de la revista Time de esta semana. La razón no era ninguno de los cuatro casos judiciales que tiene abierto, sino sus declaraciones al medio estadounidense sobre el primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu.
En una entrevista con la revista en su mansión de Mar-a-Lago, el expresidente se puso del lado de los que "con razón culpan a Bibi" por no haber sabido impedir los ataques de Hamás a ciudadanos israelíes el pasado 7 de octubre. Además, el republicano sugirió que hay "gente muy buena" que podría ocupar el puesto de Netanyahu. "Creo que Benny Gantz es bueno, pero no estoy preparado para decirlo. No he hablado con él de eso. Pero hay gente muy buena que he llegado a conocer en Israel que podría hacer un buen trabajo", contó a Time el pasado 12 de abril.
Trump fue un estrecho aliado de Netanyahu durante su mandato, y así lo demostró su política exterior: retiró a Estados Unidos del acuerdo nuclear con Irán, reconoció los Altos del Golán como parte de Israel y trasladó la embajada estadounidense de Tel Aviv a Jerusalén. Pero la relación entre ambos líderes se volvió agria cuando Netanyahu felicitó a Joe Biden por ganar las elecciones de 2020 y publicó un discurso en vídeo con motivo de la toma de posesión del actual presidente demócrata.
En la entrevista de Time, el republicano añadió otro episodio: que Israel se desmarcara del ataque liderado por Estados Unidos en 2020 en Irak que mató al general iraní de alto rango Qasem Soleimani. "Tuve una mala experiencia con Bibi, y eso no me hizo feliz. Fue algo que nunca olvidé. Y me enseñó algo", dijo al periodista Eric Cortellessa.
A principios de abril, Trump ya aseguró en un programa de radio conservador que Israel está "perdiendo la guerra de las relaciones públicas" en Gaza y urgió a Netanyahu a "terminar" con el conflicto. Añadió que los palestinos "están mostrando imágenes horribles de edificios cayéndose con gente dentro". El republicano no quiso contestar directamente sobre si estaba "cien por cien con Israel" en su ocupación del enclave palestino de Gaza en respuesta a los ataques de la milicia de Hamás el pasado 7 de octubre.
El mensaje de Trump resuena en la opinión de muchos israelíes, que desde el 7 de octubre exigen respuestas a su Gobierno sobre cómo los servicios de inteligencia y las fuerzas militares no pudieron evitar la matanza de casi 1.200 personas y el secuestro de otras 200. Las encuestas muestran que Netanyahu va por detrás de su principal rival político, el general retirado del ejército Benny Gantz. Gantz, miembro del gabinete de guerra de Netanyahu, ha pedido elecciones para septiembre.
Mientras, las Fuerzas de Defensa Israelíes siguen bombardeando Rafah a la espera de que sus tropas incursionen en el último recodo por invadir de la Franja. Este martes, Netanyahu prometió que la operación de tomar por tierra la ciudad más al sur de Gaza seguiría en pie "con o sin" un acuerdo con Hamás sobre los rehenes.
En los últimos días han aumentado las expectativas de que se alcance un acuerdo de alto el fuego, tras un renovado impulso liderado por Egipto para reactivar las estancadas negociaciones entre Israel y Hamás. Este martes, una fuente del grupo islamista declaró a la cadena de televisión saudí Al-Arabiya que el último acuerdo propuesto por Israel ya responde algunas de las condiciones que Hamás pide para un alto el fuego.
Según Reuters, una persona cercana a Netanyahu ha dicho que Israel ha estado esperando a que Hamás responda a las últimas propuestas de alto el fuego presentadas por Egipto antes de enviar un equipo a El Cairo para continuar las conversaciones. Pero la retórica del primer ministro sigue siendo la de destruir los cuatro batallones de Hamás que supuestamente quedan en Rafah, donde se refugian más de un millón de palestinos desplazados del resto de la Franja.
Para Netanyahu, es probable que cualquier medida se vea afectada por las divisiones en su gabinete de coalición entre los ministros que presionan para traer de vuelta a casa al menos a algunos de los 133 rehenes israelíes que quedan en Gaza, y los partidarios de la línea dura que insisten en el largamente prometido asalto a los batallones de Hamás que quedan en Rafah.

Article: Spiterman lokiyo interrumpe pelea en la Independencia y se hace viral
Ciudad Juárez.– A través de las redes sociales, el pasado mes de marzo se hizo viral un video donde un joven disfrazado de Spider-Man interrumpía una pelea entre dos hombres en el camellón del bulevar Independencia cruce con Santiago Troncoso.
NetNoticias logró contactar a Luis Gerardo Gardea, de 28 años, quien diariamente acude hasta este cruce para realizar un espectáculo de baile urbano con el atuendo del conocido personaje de Marvel para recaudar fondos.
“A mí siempre me ha gustado el break dance, además del personaje del Hombre Araña, entonces decidí hacer esta actividad después de mi jornada laboral y creo que sirve para reducir los niveles de estrés que se generan en los cruces por el tráfico. Ese día un conductor me dijo que se estaban peleando en el camellón que fuera y los separa, pero cuando llegué ya estaba un agente de la policía poniendo orden”, explicó Gerardo.
Después de ese suceso, las cuentas del artista urbano comenzaron a despuntar en cuanto a sus seguidores, además de que ahora ya lo identifican como el bailarín del crucero y le han llegado a hacer propuestas de trabajo para amenizar fiestas infantiles en escuelas y eventos.
“Yo trabajo en el área de mantenimiento en una empresa maquiladora, también bailo en los cruceros y ahora en las fiestas de los niños. Gracia a Dios me está yendo muy bien, pero mi intención es poder sacar la sonrisa de los choferes que pasan por aquí, hacer más relajada la espera de los semáforos y que vean que todo pasa”, destacó "Spiterman Lokiyo", como se hace llamar.
El hombre espera seguir teniendo la aprobación de las personas, por ello Gerardo continuará trabajando y mejorando sus técnicas de baile.
Para hacer contacto, los interesados pueden consultar sus redes sociales como "Spiterman Lokiyo" en Facebook.

Article: Se confirmó la fecha de pago de los sueldos de abril para los trabajadores estatales y docentes de Neuquén.
Los trabajadores estatales de Neuquén cobrarán los sueldos de abril con aumento. Tal como se informó a mediados de mes, tras conocerse el último índice de inflación, el incremento salarial será del 25,7%. La indexación surge de la acumulación inflacionaria en el bimestre febrero- marzo.
El Gobierno provincial depositará los haberes a la administración pública provincial correspondientes a abril este miércoles 1 de mayo. Al igual que en febrero y marzo, no habrá cronograma de pago ya que todos los estatales (trabajadores de Educación, Salud, Seguridad, Administración central y demás organismos del Estado provincial) cobrarán este día.
Los sueldos estarán disponibles en las cuentas del Banco de la Provincia del Neuquén (BPN).
Sueldos de abril con aumento
El secretario general de ATE Neuquén, Carlos Quintriqueo, explicó que el 25,7% de incremento es un promedio de la mejora que tendrán los estatales, aunque de forma individual el porcentaje puede variar. Aseguró que en los salarios más bajos el impacto será superior al porcentaje promedio, mientras que en los más altos podría ser inferior al 25,7%.
Por su lado, los docentes nucleados en ATEN, ponderaron otras cuestiones al destacar el incremento a percibir. La cuenta que hacen no toma el aumento por mes por IPC, sino que considera el bimestre febrero-marzo, el que cierra en un 25,67% de incremento salarial, más la suba del 11% que concedió el gobierno provincial por acta acuerdo. Esto hace un total de 36,67% de aumento.
Sin embargo, no es un número cerrado ni igual para todos los docentes, de acuerdo a la categoría que presenten en el escalafón. "El 38, 5% es un promedio. Algunos van a cobrar un poco menos y otros un poco más, entre el 36% y el 40%", informó Guagliardo.
En base al acta acuerdo que firmaron a fines de marzo, para el aumento que van a recibir en mayo, se considerará el salario de abril 2024 con las variaciones de IPC de febrero y marzo 2024. Más un 11% de incremento por convenio.
Los próximos aumentos para estatales
El acuerdo que firmaron ATE, ATEN, UPCN y Viales con el gobierno de Rolando Figueroa fijó el siguiente cronograma de incrementos: para la actualización de abril, se considerará el salario del mes de marzo 2024, que acumulará las variaciones del IPC de los meses de febrero y marzo de 2024.
En las actualizaciones siguientes se aplicará la variación acumulada del trimestre inmediato anterior: actualización de julio 2024, surgirá del IPC acumulado de los meses de abril, mayo y junio, sobre el salario conformado en la última actualización realizada en el mes de abril.
En octubre de 2024, el IPC acumulado de los meses de julio, agosto y septiembre, sobre el salario conformado en la última actualización del primer mes del trimestre. En enero de 2025, será el IPC acumulado de los meses de octubre, noviembre y diciembre del 2024, sobre el salario conformado en la última actualización de octubre del 2024.
Bonos para estatales
Como parte del acuerdo salarial, ATE y UPCN percibieron una suma de carácter extraordinario, no remunerativa y no bonificable de 150.000 pesos, que se abonó en la primera quincena de marzo. El pasado 17 de abril también se pagó la primera compensación por ropa de trabajo, de 154 mil pesos. La segunda cuota será en septiembre, y su valor resultará de la actualización del IPC ponderado de mayo a agosto inclusive.
Como parte del acuerdo, también se estableció la actualización por IPC de las Asignaciones Familiares. Por último, se consideró la reapertura de los Convenios Colectivos de Trabajo (CCT) de RTN, EPAS, Tribunal de Cuentas, Obras Públicas y Termas.
En tanto, el gremio ATEN percibió el 17 de abril la compensación extraordinaria de 125.000 pesos aplicando la metodología de liquidación del Fondo Nacional de Incentivo Docente (Fonid), tal lo pactado en el acta acuerdo del 28 de marzo último. Los jubilados, por su lado, percibieron el bono el pasado viernes 26 de abril. "Es una Suma Extraordinaria entre $100 y $200 mil pesos según los cargos u horas con que se hayan jubilado", afirmó Guagliardo.

Article: Luego del pico de inflación de 25,5% en diciembre, el costo de vida regresó a la senda de un dígito mensual en abril, según estimaciones privadas. La última vez que el indicador oficial se ubicó por debajo de las dos cifras data de octubre del año pasado, cuando marcó 8,3% en un contexto de fuerte control de precios.
El proceso de desinflación se aceleró a partir de enero (20,6%), sorprendió en febrero (13,2%) y comenzó a enlentecerse en marzo (11%). La tesis del Gobierno es que el descenso de la dinámica inflacionaria responde al paso de la motosierra y la licuadora por las cuentas públicas así como al "saneamiento" del balance del Banco Central y el abandono del financiamiento de la autoridad monetaria al Tesoro vía emisión monetaria.
Economistas de distintas vertientes suman al combo del oficialismo la magnitud de la recesión que deprime la demanda interna y obliga a las empresas a recalcular los valores a los que ofrecen sus productos o servicios y al crawling peg (microdevaluaciones diarias) de 2% por mes fijado por el BCRA. Este actúa como un ancla cambiaria que mantiene a raya las expectativas de una devaluación futura.
Inflación de abril, en un dígito tras cinco meses
A propósito de la inflación de abril, la fundación Libertad y Progreso aseguró que su Índice de Precios al Consumidor (IPC) arrojó un aumento de 8,4%, desacelerándose 2,6 puntos porcentuales respecto a la medición del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (INDEC) en marzo.
"De esta manera, en los primeros cuatro meses del año el IPC acumula una suba de 64,4%. La variación interanual alcanza el 287,8%, similar al dato del mes anterior. A su vez, la inflación núcleo marcó una fuerte desaceleración respecto al dato de marzo, llegando a 4,4%, alcanzando su menor variación mensual desde enero de 2022, según los datos oficiales. Por su parte, los regulados manifiestan una suba cercana al 18%", detallaron.
A la vez, remarcaron que el IPC de abril "deja un arrastre de 1,0 puntos porcentuales para mayo, unos 0,8 puntos menos que en marzo". En cuanto a mayo, aventuraron un indicador en torno al 7% con una núcleo -no tiene en cuenta estacionalidad ni factores exógenos- moviéndose en torno al 5% mensual.
Para la consultora C&T, el Gran Buenos Aires (GBA) acusó una suba de 8,7% a lo largo del cuarto mes de 2024, en línea con la tendencia a la baja del primer trimestre. La variación interanual medida por la firma alcanzó el 298,1% y los analistas plantearon que la marcha atrás de las prepagas con los aumentos de las cuotas (entre 20% y 26%) tendrá un impacto de 1,5 puntos porcentuales menos en la medición de abril.
"Como ha ocurrido en febrero y marzo, estimamos que la inflación a nivel nacional será menor que en GBA por el mayor impacto de las tarifas. Luego del mayor incremento en la primera semana del mes, en la que se computa el impacto de alzas de precios regulados (gas, agua y educación), el IPC C&T registró variaciones semanales prácticamente nulas en las tres semanas siguientes", precisaron.
Y acotaron: "A su vez, la inflación núcleo, que deja de lado precios regulados y estacionales, fue de 6,9% en el mes, la menor desde julio del año pasado. El rubro de mayor peso, alimentos y bebidas, subió 6,8% en el mes, con gran predominancia de panificados, carnes y lácteos".
Desde LCG, sostuvieron que "asumiendo que en la última semana de abril la suba de precios de los alimentos se sostiene en 0,7% semanal, el mes cerraría con un aumento promedio del 3,2%".
"Esto impone 1 puntos porcentuales de inflación, a los que habrá que sumarle la incidencia de los aumentos de gas (+211%, 0,8 pp) y de electricidad (+181%, 3,4 pp) en este mes. Nuestra proyección de inflación minorista para abril se ubica en torno a 9% mensual, perforando los dos dígitos por primera vez en 5 meses", establecieron los consultores.
Por su parte, Econviews, la consultora de Miguel Kiguel, detectó dos semanas seguidas de deflación en alimentos y productos de cuidado personal en el mes que llega a su fin, una clara señal de que las remarcaciones hacia arriba se morigeraron en las grandes superficies comerciales.
"Hay muchos peros porque nuestra canasta no es idéntica a la del INDEC y la muestra de comercios es más chica, pero aún así en los últimos meses los alimentos que medimos tuvieron trayectoria bastante similar a la de los subíndices de alimentos del índice de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires y la del INDEC para el Gran Buenos Aires", dictaminaron y anticiparon una inflación de entre 9% y 10%.
Según los economistas de EcoGo, los precios subieron un 9,1% después de un marcado descenso de los productos alimenticios. "La suba en la proyección respecto a la semana previa responde a la homologación de la paritaria de encargados de edificios, que contempla los meses de enero a abril. Este número no contempla la caída en los precios de las prepagas", explicaron.
Por último, la consultora Invecq también midió una desaceleración inflacionaria en abril. El IPC elaborado por la consultora del economista Esteban Domecq indicó que la inflación se ubicó en 9,5% mensual, una caída de 1,5 puntos porcentuales respecto a la medición del mes previo.

Article: En la Estación Experimental Agropecuaria (EEA) de INTA Reconquista, el lunes 29 de abril la Diputada Provincial “Charo” Mancini mantuvo una reunión productiva con el equipo de gestión de dicha institución, encabezado por el Ing. Agr. Marcelo Paytas, Director de la misma.
En este marco, se abordaron varios programas y proyectos importantes que la Agencia coordina en su área de influencia, que abarca varios departamentos en el norte santafesino.
En representación del INTA, también participaron de dicha reunión el Méd. Vet. Gustavo Rosatti, responsable de Gestión y Producción Animal; Lic. Daniela Viti, Coordinadora de Áreas de Producción; e Ing. Agr. Ana Deambrosi, Jefe de Agencia de Extensión Rural.
Entre otros temas, los presentes intercambiaron respecto al trabajo que coordina la EEA INTA Reconquista dentro de los departamentos General Obligado, 9 de Julio, Vera y San Javier. En este espacio se puntualizó el apoyo a las mujeres rurales, el desarrollo de bosques nativos, proyectos relacionados con la ganadería, apicultura, floricultura y agricultura, con enfoques agroecológicos. Además, se mencionó la implementación futura de una plataforma digital para agilizar la recolección de datos, lo cual demuestra un enfoque en la innovación y la eficiencia en el trabajo de la institución.
También se abordó el problema de la falta de partida presupuestaria por parte del Gobierno Nacional a dicha entidad, y la necesidad de búsqueda de alternativas ante la no renovación del programa nacional “Prohuerta”.
Después de la reunión, la Legisladora tosquense realizó un recorrido guiado por el Laboratorio de Biotecnologías, a cargo del Ing. Agr. Martín Winkler, quien destacó el objetivo de alcanzar mejores y más resistentes cultivos en la región.

Article: Su familia donará elementos de cocina al comedor donde el joven periodista asesinado trabajó por los más necesitados. Cómo podés ayudar.
A un mes del crimen del periodista Juan Caliani, su familia tuvo un gesto conmovedor para recordarlo: con el dinero de sus últimos haberes, compró elementos de cocina que acercará este miércoles primero de mayo hasta el comedor donde el joven trabajó "codo a codo" durante los momentos más difíciles de la pandemia de Covid-19.
La iniciativa también invita a todos sus compañeros y amigos a que participen con un alimento no perecedero. Se trata del comedor Esperanza y Lucha ubicado en la calle Rosario de Santa Fe 4323 (Fiske Menuco).
"A un mes de los tristes hechos que terminaron con la vida de nuestro querido Juan Caliani, desde la familia queremos agradecer profundamente a toda la sociedad del Alto Valle de Rio Negro y Neuquén, por el apoyo, el afecto y el acompañamiento que hemos recibido en estos largos 30 días. En especial a las distintas organizaciones deportivas y sociales. A los medios de comunicación y periodistas que se pusieron a disposición desde el primer momento. Al Grupo Cumbre, que estuvo desde el primer minuto. A todos los vecinos del barrio, por ese sentido abrazo", manifestaron.
Extendieron su agradecimiento a los amigos de la familia, amigos y compañeros de Juan que "son un montón, siempre comparten anécdotas y momentos en sus redes, también colaboran y nos ayudan, nos dan fuerzas para continuar, gracias a todos ellos".
Desde el entorno familiar se expresaron conformes con el trabajo de la Justicia. Reconocieron "la prolijidad y profesionalismo" que desplegaron, en conjunto con personal policial de la Comisaria N°17 y de Criminalística. "Este trabajo permitió dar con los presuntos autores del crimen de nuestro querido Juan", acotaron.
El crimen de Juan Caliani
Cabe recordar que al periodista y productor de radio lo asesinaron a puñaladas en ocasión de un robo, mientras convivía con sus padres en una casa de calle Cacique Purrná y Beltrná en el barrio La Sirena. El terreno tenía la vivienda principal adelante y en el fondo había una especie de quincho.
Alrededor de las 23:30 del 1° de abril, el joven productor de radio Cumbre se topó en el patio de su casa con la presencia de los ladrones.
Todo fue muy vertiginoso y por las lesiones que presenta el cuerpo de nuestro colega, entabló una lucha cuerpo a cuerpo con el asaltante que cuchillo en mano le asestó tres puñaladas. Mientras Juan se desangraba tirado en el patio de su casa, los ladrones se dieron a la fuga.
No obstante, el trabajo profesional y riguroso de los funcionarios policiales y judiciales permitió días después la detención de los presuntos autores del crimen: dos adolescentes, de 16 y 17 años, que permanecen detenidos.
"Este 1° de mayo queremos recordar a Juan con un poquito de su esencia, con solidaridad, con alegría, con compromiso. Es por ello que decidimos acercarnos al comedor Esperanza y Lucha, donde Juan colaboró y trabajó codo a codo durante los momentos más difíciles de la pandemia", concluyó su familia.
Continuarán en este camino, pidiendo justicia por Juan Caliani.

Article: La nueva modalidad se puede utilizar desde el sitio web del organismo. Desde allí se pueden imprimir las facturas correspondientes.
Las facturas correspondientes al pago de los coseguro de las consultas y prácticas médicas del Instituto de Seguridad Social del Neuquén (ISSN) se podrán hacer ahora a través del sitio de Internet oficial del organismo (www.issn.gov.ar). Este martes se informó cómo hacer para concretar el trámite respectivo.
Luego de que el afiliado o adherente haya concurrido al consultorio médico, deberá ingresar a la web y hacer clic en “oficina virtual”, ubicado en el menú superior de la página.
Las personas que ya tengan su usuario en el sistema SAU (Sistema de Autenticación de Usuarios) deberán ingresar con sus datos.
En el caso de los afiliados que no lo tengan deberán crearlo por única vez siguiendo las instrucciones que le indica el sistema.
Una vez dentro de la oficina virtual deberán hacer clic en “estado de cuenta” y allí estarán las facturas correspondientes a los coseguros, las que podrán ser descargadas para ser abonadas mediante los siguientes medios de pago:
- Pago Fácil
- Mercado Pago (con código de barras).
- Ventanilla del BPN.
- Delegaciones del ISSN.
Cuándo se paga
Desde el ISSN, informaron que tomaron el compromiso de que todos los afiliados que realicen consultas o prácticas médicas podrán pagar el coseguro al mes siguiente. El tema surgió luego de que muchos afiliados plantearon dudas al respecto el cobro indebido del plus.
Daniel Daglio, administrador del ISSN, explicó recientemente la diferencia entre el coseguro y el plus. "El coseguro es algo que existe desde el plan médico obligatorio, que es la canasta básica de prestaciones que las obras sociales ofrecen a sus afiliados y donde se paga un 20% de la práctica o de la consulta. Eso siempre existió, desde antes de que existiera el ISSN, desde 1970" señaló.
En tanto, agregó que "el plus es un pago extra contractual, indebido, que alguien decide hacer por fuera de los contratos que tiene firmados con la institución".
"Ambos, en este estado de vulnerabilidad que tiene la población por el aumento de la inflación tan descontrolado los últimos meses, constituyen una barrera al acceso a las prestaciones en el momento que los afiliados las necesitan", sostuvo Daglio.
ATE denuncia bajas masivas de los afiliados del ISSN
En la última semana, se denunció la baja masiva de afiliados del Instituto de Seguridad Social de Neuquén (ISSN), en toda la provincia. El secretario general de ATE y la CTA de Neuquén, Carlos Quintriqueo, aseguró que se trata de una campaña de desprestigio contra los trabajadores del Estado, para que estos se vayan a prepagas.
Las primeras quejas fueron recibidas desde primera hora del miércoles, cuando empleados estatales se contactaron con el gremio para alertar que habían sido dados de bajas en ISSN y que no podían acceder a ninguna prestación médica. Asimismo, indicaron que habían intentado contactarse directamente al Instituto, pero que nadie los había atendido.
"Cuando nos alertaron de lo que estaba pasando fuimos a chequear la información y nos dimos cuenta de que eran compañeros con muchos años de antigüedad, que de buenas a primeras el ISSN los había bajado como afiliados sin ningún aviso o algo", dijo el gremialista en declaraciones radiales.
No obstante, cuando los afectados fueron a realizar el reclamo en la página oficial de la obra social, les indicaban que se acercaran con su último recibo de sueldo a la delegación más cercana o a la sede central entre el horario de 7 a 13:30, franja horaria en que los mismos empleados se encuentran en sus puestos de trabajo. "Nos parece, un despropósito la actitud de la gente del ISSN porque si es un error de ellos deberían subsanarlo y no el trabajador andar justificando que es afiliado a nuestra obra social, más teniendo en cuenta que son compañeros de 20 años, 25 años de antigüedad dentro del Estado", observó Quintriqueo.
Durante la jornada del miércoles detectaron "un sinnúmero de compañeros y compañeras que hoy están sin cobertura producto de algún artilugio de quien conduce la obra social, tanto el administrador como el secretario general de bajarlos".
"A todos los compañeros y compañeras que dieron de baja les realizaron la retención de los aportes, se le descontó y hoy no tiene acceso a ningún tipo de servicio. Cuando van a hacerse una consulta o una prestación, se encuentran con que no figuran como afiliados a la obra social", aseguró.

Article: El polémico capítulo fue aprobado en la votación en particular. Recibió 82 votos afirmativos, 77 negativos y 69 abstenciones.
La Cámara de Diputados aprobó la incorporación a la ley Bases el capítulo referido a los impuestos al tabaco. Fue por 82 votos a favor, 77 en contra y 69 abstenciones. Esto obliga a Pablo Otero, conocido como el “Señor Tabaco”, a pagar impuestos.
El impuesto al tabaco era uno de los temas que más había estancado las negociaciones previas al debate entre los representantes oficialistas y los bloques dialoguistas.
Cómo votaron los diputados
La incorporación de la norma significó una victoria para gran parte de los sectores opositores. A excepción del kirchnerismo, cuya mayoría de los legisladores se abstuvieron en la votación particular, manteniéndose firmes en su postura de no agregar el capítulo y tratarlo en un proyecto aparte más adelante.
No obstante, 21 diputados de Unión por la Patria terminaron dando su voto afirmativo e inclinaron la balanza para su aprobación. En la lista de quienes votaron por la inclusión del tema se encuentran la albertista Victoria Tolosa Paz, Agustina Propato, diputada y esposa de Sergio Berni, el ex canciller Santiago Cafiero, y el ex jefe de AFIP, Carlos Castagneto.
“Yo tengo serias diferencias con la Libertad Avanza, pero me parecía que quitar el impuesto mínimo y aumentar la alícuota para dar un criterio de igualdad y que todas las tabacaleras en la Argentina tributen para robustecer al fisco, para coparticipar impuestos y para además devolverle al fondo de tabaco de donde se nutren los pequeños productores, era lo que yo sentía que había que hacer”, dijo Tolosa Paz.
Qué dice el capítulo sobre el tabaco
Uno de los artículos más importantes sobre el tabaco dice que: “Los cigarrillos, tanto de producción nacional como importados, tributarán sobre el precio de venta al consumidor, inclusive impuestos, excepto el impuesto al valor agregado, un gravamen del setenta y tres por ciento (73 %). Los cigarrillos de producción nacional o extranjera deberán expenderse en paquetes o envases en las condiciones y formas que reglamente el Poder Ejecutivo nacional”.
El capítulo tabacalero formaba parte del primer proyecto de Ley Ómnibus que había enviado el Ejecutivo originalmente. Sin embargo, fue quitada de la nueva versión generando fuertes críticas de sectores aliados.
Los cambios originales proponían que todas las empresas del sector paguen los mismos impuestos. El perjudicado de esa modificación a la actual ley sería Pablo Otero, dueño de Tabacalera Sarandí, que paga menos que sus competidores ya que tiene en la Justicia un amparo contra el impuesto mínimo al cigarrillo.
Los artículos más importantes
-“Cuando el precio de venta al consumidor informado por los sujetos pasivos del gravamen no constituya una base idónea a los fines de determinar el valor imponible, corresponderá utilizar el precio que determine la Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos. Se considerará que no constituye una base idónea todo precio informado por los sujetos pasivos, que resulte inferior, como mínimo, en un veinte por ciento (20 %) al precio que surja del relevamiento mencionado en el párrafo anterior”.
-“Los cigarrillos, tanto de producción nacional como importados, tributarán sobre el precio de venta al consumidor, inclusive impuestos, excepto el impuesto al valor agregado, un gravamen del setenta y tres por ciento (73 %)”.
-“Los importes consignados en el segundo párrafo de este Artículo se actualizarán trimestralmente, por trimestre calendario, sobre la base de las variaciones del Índice de Precios al Consumidor (IPC), que suministre el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos, considerando las variaciones acumuladas de dicho índice desde el mes de enero de 2018, inclusive. Sin perjuicio de ello, el Poder Ejecutivo nacional podrá, con las condiciones indicadas en el Artículo sin número agregado a continuación del Artículo 14, cuando las circunstancias económicas así lo requiera a los efectos de garantizar la sostenibilidad fiscal, aumentar hasta en un veinticinco por ciento (25 %) o disminuir, con el objeto de estimular en virtud de las circunstancias económicas imperantes el desarrollo de determinados sectores siempre que no se comprometa la sostenibilidad fiscal hasta en un diez por ciento por ciento (10 %) transitoriamente los referidos montos mínimos”.
-“Este importe se actualizará conforme a lo indicado en el cuarto párrafo del Artículo 16″.
-“El transporte de tabaco despalillado, acondicionado, picado, en hebras o reconstituido o de polvo para la elaboración reconstituido, no comprendido en el Artículo 18, fuera de los establecimientos y locales debidamente habilitados que se efectúe, sin importar su destino, sin el correspondiente respaldo documental de traslado o con documentación de traslado con irregularidades, será sancionado con una multa equivalente al importe que resulte de aplicar la alícuota dispuesta en el primer párrafo del Artículo 15 sobre el precio que surja del relevamiento al que se refiere el Artículo sin número agregado a continuación del Artículo 2º, en proporción a la cantidad de cigarrillos que resulte de dividir el total de gramos de tabaco transportado por ochenta centésimos (0,80), considerando el momento de la detección”.

Article: En 2023 el empleo fue menor que el 2022, pero mayor que prepandemia; sin embargo, esto no significa una mejora del mercado laboral.
Cuando el 2023 terminó, 156 700 peruanos perdieron sus empleos. Esto fue el resultado de la recesión económica que agobió principalmente a la pequeña empresa, que alberga entre 11 a 50 trabajadores por negocio, según datos del INEI.
La situación se complicó en 16 de 24 departamentos, donde hubo más pérdida de empleos, según el análisis de Comex Perú. Cajamarca tuvo el peor resultado con más de 59 000 puestos menos, le siguen Piura y Puno.
“El sector más afectado fue el agropecuario porque más de 300 000 personas dejaron de trabajar y lo más preocupante es que el 2022 y el 2021, se habían perdido más de 400 000 empleos. En construcción y comercio también se reportó una pérdida de empleo por menor inversión y al menor consumo privado”, explicó Daniel Najarro, analista de Estudios Económicos de Comex Perú.
El 2019, un total de 17 133 100 peruanos trabajaban, y al 2023 fueron 17 195 300, pero esto no significa una mejora en el empleo. Solo en el caso de la informalidad, esta se redujo de 74 % a 71.1 %, porque 600 000 trabajadores informales perdieron su fuente de ingresos.
Hay más trabajo que el 2019, pero no mejor calidad de empleo
Un buen empleo le da dinero suficiente a un peruano para pagar alimentación, vivienda y otras necesidades personales (canasta de consumo); sin embargo, cuando se tiene que sostener a toda una familia, la situación cambia.
Una canasta familiar de 4 personas cuesta más de S/ 1 660 en promedio y solo el año pasado, 4 de cada 10 trabajadores ganaron menos del sueldo básico valorizado en 1 025 soles sobre todo en Puno, Huancavelica y Cajamarca, donde la informalidad es más alta y alcanza a 7 de cada 10 trabajadores, estos departamentos también registran las remuneraciones más bajas del Perú.
Para inicios de este año, los ingresos se han recuperado refiere el director de Videnza Instituto Luis Miguel Castilla; pero solo en Lima Metropolitana pues en regiones todavía es dispar.
“El débil crecimiento en los últimos 2 años ha generado que la recuperación del PBI per cápita sea lenta. Según la Encuesta Permanente de Empleo (del INEI), durante el primer trimestre del 2024 en Lima Metropolitana, el ingreso promedio mensual proveniente del trabajo fue de 1 979 soles, un 7.5 % superior al mismo periodo en el 2023 y 15.3 % superior al del 2019”, refirió.
Aunque una mejora en los sueldos tampoco refiere mejores condiciones laborales, pues el subempleo, aquel donde los peruanos trabajan menos horas de las permitidas o reciben menos ingresos que un sueldo básico, creció.
“No diría que el empleo ha mejorado, sino a empeorado con relación a prepandemia. El subempleo creció más de 50 %, la participación de jóvenes en el mercado laboral ha caído fuertemente y los ingresos a penas si han podido mantenerse en línea con la inflación, gracias al sector formal”, explicó por su parte Miguel Jaramillo, investigador principal del GRADE.
Además, por la misma recesión económica, una empresa es más cauta al contratar, lo que lleva a un peruano a encontrar un empleo casi tres semanas después de perderlo, cuando el 2020 lo encontraba unos días después de la segunda semana.
¿Perspectiva para el 2024?
Los investigadores consultados en este informe explican que la situación mejorará conforme la recuperación de las empresas. Recordemos que queda pendiente la recuperación del casi medio millón de empleos perdidos en los sectores de agricultura, pesca, minería, manufactura y construcción, que generan casi 4 de cada 10 trabajos en el Perú.
De todas estas actividades solo construcción muestra una mejora en su producción, el resto todavía no sale del terreno negativo en lo que va del 2024.

Article: El cadáver permaneció más de dos meses en la morgue. Lo sepultaron en el cementerio municipal porque su familia no se interesó en trasladar el cuerpo.
El 12 de febrero de este año, el cuerpo de un turista australiano de 30 años fue hallado en Bariloche. Su deceso se produjo por una autodeterminación y recién en los últimos días, luego de más de dos meses de trámites internacionales, el cuerpo fue sepultado en la ciudad lacustre rionegrina.
A partir del hallazgo del cadáver del ciudadano australiano, el Ministerio Público Fiscal inició las gestiones para contactar a los familiares de la víctima, quienes no se sorprendieron con la noticia. Desde el organismo le informaron sobre la necesidad de iniciar el trámite para repatriar el cuerpo, aunque la familia rechazó la opción.
Fuentes del organismo le confirmaron que desde el entorno cercano del turista expresaron desinterés en repatriar el cuerpo, argumentando dificultades económicas para poder afrontar el costo.
El Ministerio Público, a partir de esa respuesta, inició las gestiones consulares con la misma finalidad, aunque tampoco hubo respuestas afirmativas.
Producto de esas trabas, el cuerpo de la víctima permaneció durante más de dos meses en la morgue local hasta que, cuando promediaba abril, fue sepultado en el Cementerio local, luego de otro trámite complejo con el municipio local.
Cómo llegó el turista australiano a Bariloche y de qué manera murió
John Ronald Douglas Byron se alojó el 7 de febrero en una hostería local y la reserva era por tres noches, es decir que el 11 a las 10 debía abandonarla y realizar el trámite del check out.
Sin embargo, el dueño del establecimiento notó su ausencia y por ese motivo optó por radicar una denuncia por presunta desaparición de persona.
Al día siguiente de la fecha en la que debía dejar la habitación, el 12, su cuerpo fue hallado en la costa del lago Nahuel Huapi. Luego del operativo de rigor, la Justicia dispuso que sea sometido a una autopsia, la cual confirmó que el deceso se produjo por una autodeterminación.
El caso pasó a la órbita del Ministerio Público Fiscal, que inició la compleja tarea de ubicar a sus familiares. Lo logró, tras una efectiva gestión. Sin embargo, la respuesta no era la esperada.
Tras recibir la negativa de hacerse cargo del cuerpo y de afrontar los costos de repatriación, el Ministerio Público contactó a las autoridades consultares del país de Oceanía, aunque tampoco fue posible lograr que se hagan cargo de dicho trámite.
La tercera opción, que fue la que finalmente se llevó adelante, fue ante el municipio local, para inhumarlo en el cementerio local.
No obstante, dicho trámite también fue complejo ya que, para poder ceder una parcela, era necesario tramitar un certificado de indigencia.
El cuerpo, luego de permanecer más de 2 meses en la morgue local, fue sepultado como NN en el Cementerio local. Ni las gestiones internacionales, ni la insistencia de los funcionarios judiciales locales ante la familia del hombre, pudieron lograr que los restos de John Ronald Douglas Byron descansen en paz en la tierra que lo vio nacer.
Quedará entre las historias urbanas de Bariloche, la del australiano que eligió el frío de la Patagonia para terminar con su vida. Una vida de la que nadie supo más que su nacionalidad, su nombre y el desinterés de su familia por darle en Australia un último adiós.

Article: El elenco de Seattle Sounders, en donde juega el delantero peruano Raúl Ruídiaz, fue visitante y el exjugador de Universitario de Deportes, Monarcas Morelia y el FBC Melgar se encargó de poner por delante a su conjunto.
A los 13 minutos del primer tiempo, Ruidíaz aprovechó un descuido del portero local, quien se encontraba adelantado, y no la pensó dos veces: le pegó a la pelota con derecha y colgó al guardameta rival desde la media cancha. Golazo para el internacional con la Selección Peruana en una nueva jornada de la liga norteamericana.
Raúl Ruidíaz y un golazo para Seattle Sounders
La anotación del atacante sorprendió a propios y ajenas. Incluso, los comentaristas de la transmisión oficial destacaron lo hecho por el popular 'Pulga'.
Es más, las cosas no quedaron allí para el delantero debido a que firmó un doblete. Su segund gol llegó por medio de un tiro de penal al estilo Panenka, haciendo imposible la estirada del guardameta.
Hay que tener en cuenta que Raúl Ruidíaz es el goleador histórico del Seattle Sounders debido a que en el pasado mes de marzo llegó a los 80 goles con su club.
"Voy a ser honesto, como siempre lo he dicho. Uno se siente orgulloso, yo me siento orgulloso porque es un gran reto salir de tu país y ser el goleador histórico de un club muy importante", sostuvo tras alcanzar ese récord.

Article: Fueron los familiares del empresario quienes pagaron el dinero para que fuera liberado en Trujillo. La Policía Nacional había señalado lo contrario.
El empresario Iván Díaz Garrido, de 57 años, quien fue secuestrado por delincuentes vestidos con chalecos de la Policía Nacional en octubre del 2023 y permaneció en cautiverio durante 11 días, reveló que su familia pagó 250 mil dólares a los delincuentes a cambio de su liberación. Esta afirmación lo hace pese a que en su momento el General Francisco Vargas Andonaire, quien era jefe policial en La Libertad, indicó que no se había pagado por su rescate.
"Fue mentira por parte de la Policía porque al final se pagó. Ellos no intervinieron en nada, más bien la gente manifestaba que todo ya estaba arreglado antes de. La Policía ya estaba antes de que lleguen a la tienda. 250 mil dólares pagaron familiares que les he pedido prestado", manifestó para RPP.
El empresario Iván Díaz también sindicó a los integrantes de la organización criminal 'Los Pulpos' de ser los presuntos autores materiales del secuestro; sin embargo, acusó a su expareja Juanita Giver Sandoval de presuntamente ordenar el hecho, por lo que solicitó a las autoridades policiales, de la Fiscalía y el Poder Judicial dar celeridad a las investigaciones del caso.
Recordemos que el secuestro se produjo el 23 de octubre del año pasado cuando el empresario se encontraba en su local ubicado en la cuadra 12 de la Av. Perú, en Trujillo, y fue liberado 11 días después con mutilaciones en las manos y oreja.
La semana pasada la Policía capturó a Luis Blas Rodríguez, alias 'Negrasho', de 24 años, quien aceptó haber participado del secuestro.
El ataque de 'Los Pulpos'
Ivan Díaz Garrido fue encontrado el pasado 4 de noviembre por los policías con signos de tortura. Los delincuentes lo encontraron enmarrocado y con una toalla en la cabeza en medio de cañaverales del distrito de Laredo, en la provincia de Trujillo. Fue en esa zona donde agentes de la comisaría local lo encontraron, herido y desorientado, y lo trasladaron a una clínica local.
Este tipo de operaciones criminales, llevada a cabo por ‘Los Pulpos’, no es nueva. De hecho, esa fórmula de terror tiene antecedentes.
El 15 de noviembre del 2022, la empresaria Nilda Alejandra Arrascue Espinoza (43), dueña de Tiendas Tía de Trujillo, fue secuestrada por cuatro hombres que vestían chalecos policiales. El plagio ocurrió en la urbanización de Palermo, cuando la víctima estaba a punto de ingresar a su casa acompañada de su hijo de 12 años. Por su liberación, los delincuentes exigían un millón de dólares.
La empresaria estuvo en poder de sus captores durante 13 días, hasta que fue rescatada por la Policía en un operativo llevado a cabo en el asentamiento humano Ampliación Nuevo Horizonte, en la urbanización Salaverry, Trujillo, en horas de la madrugada.

Mónica Rosell Medina, miembro suplente de la Junta Nacional de Justicia, declinó este lunes a la convocatoria que se le realizó para que se integre como miembro pleno de dicho organismo constitucional, tras la suspensión de la restitución de los magistrados Inés Tello y Aldo Vásquez dispuesta por el Tribunal Constitucional.
RPP pudo conocer que la abogada presentó un oficio ante la JNJ, en el que hizo conocer su decisión al titular de esta entidad, Antonio de la Haza, quien en vísperas les había convocado a ella y Abraham Siles para que se constituyeran como nuevos miembros titulares.
Actualmente Rosell Medina se desempeña como presidenta del Tribunal Superior de Responsabilidades Administrativas de la Contraloría General de la República.
Declinación de Antonio de la Haza
Esta decisión se da tras la declinación de Siles a dicha convocatoria. El miembro suplente de la JNJ envió una carta a Antonio de la Haza y justificó su decisión al señalar que la vacante disponible se generó de un modo “arbitrario” e “inconstitucional”, en un contexto de “grave deterioro democrático y cuando parece estar en curso un plan de sometimiento de las instituciones constitucionales autónomas”.
En esa línea, el abogado señaló que la resolución del Tribunal Constitucional que suspende la reposición de Tello y Vásquez “viola de modo flagrante la Carta Fundamental de la cual es el guardián último”.
“Al invalidar la protección cautelar concedida por el PJ a dos magistrados titulares de la JNJ en un proceso de amparo, el TC afecta la esencia misma de la jurisdicción constitucional… desvirtuando su propia razón de ser como órgano de cierre del sistema constitucional peruano”, señaló.

Article: En La Pampa concluida la décimo séptima semana epidemiológica, el sábado 27, se confirmaron 374 casos de dengue, de los cuales 208 son autóctonos –porque no presentan antecedente de viaje a otras provincias con circulación viral- y 166 casos son importados.
CASOS AUTÓCTONOS
La dinámica situación epidemiológica en la provincia de La Pampa, requiere del compromiso de la población en la eliminación de criaderos domiciliarios (reales y potenciales) del mosquito ya que es la medida que posibilitará controlar al vector y de esa manera cortar la transmisión de la enfermedad.
DISTRIBUCIÓN POR LOCALIDAD DE LOS CASOS CONFIRMADOS
General Pico 146 (118 casos no presentan antecedente de viaje, son autóctonos); Santa Rosa 124 (56 autóctonos), Macachín 7 (6 autóctonos), Eduardo Castex 8 (un autóctono), General Acha 10 (3 autóctonos), Intendente Alvear 9 (6 autóctonos), Speluzzi 2 (uno autóctono), Vertiz 1 (autóctono), Alta Italia 2, Anguil 1, Catriló 2, Embajador Martini 2, General Campos 1, Ingeniero Luiggi 5 (uno autóctono), Lonquimay 1, Miguel Riglos 1, Quemú Quemú 1, Realicó 9, Toay 16 (4 autóctonos), Trenel 3 (uno autóctono), Victorica 5 (un autóctono), Conhelo 2 (uno autóctono), Parera 2, Puelches 1 (autóctono), Ataliva Roca 1 (autóctono), Colonia Barón 2 (uno autóctono), La Maruja 1 (autóctono), Jacinto Arauz 1, Winifreda 1, Metileo: 1 (autóctono), Guatraché: 2 (uno autóctono), Rancul: 1,

CASOS SOSPECHOSOS
Desde la Dirección de epidemiología se trabaja en la investigación de casos notificados en diferentes localidades del territorio provincial los cuales permanecen en estudio aguardando resultados. No obstant, las acciones de bloqueo se realizan frente a la sospecha.
MEDIDAS PREVENTIVAS
Desde la cartera sanitaria se solicitó a la comunidad extremar medidas de prevención.
Para evitar que el ciclo de vida del mosquito se complete se recomendó:
-Desechar objetos que estén al aire libre y en los que se pueda acumular agua (latas, botellas, neumáticos, juguetes, etc.).
-Mantener boca abajo los recipientes que no estén en uso (baldes, frascos, tachos, cacharros y macetas, entre otros.).
-Limpiar bebederos y renovar periódicamente el agua para las mascotas
-Limpiar canaletas que acumulan hojas y tierra así el agua circula y no se acumula.
-Cortar el césped o los pastizales, así se evita parte del ciclo y refugio de los mosquitos
-Tapar tanques, barriles ó cisternas que acumulen agua, incluso se puede usar tela mosquitera
-Colocar mosquiteros o telas metálicas en puertas y ventanas.
-Vaciar los colectores de desagües de aire acondicionado o lluvia.
-Usar repelente en la piel expuesta, renovándolo según lo indique el producto. En los niños debe ser aplicado por un adulto y no debe usarse en menores de 2 meses.
-Ponerse ropa (preferiblemente de colores claros) que cubra al máximo el cuerpo.
-Elegir lugares con presencia de mosquiteros. Colocar tules en cunas y cochecitos
-Utilizar tabletas repelentes en las habitaciones.
-Si presenta síntomas como fiebre alta, malestar general, dolor de cabeza, diarrea, vómitos, sarpullido en la piel se debe consultar precozmente en el centro de salud sin automedicarse.

Article: La oposición al peronismo en La Pampa, la UCR y el PRO, asumidos del lado Milei en la nueva grieta nacional, parece haber desarrollado una capacidad asombrosa para sortear las contradicciones políticas actuales. Una doble cara, doble personalidad, entre ser oficialistas a nivel nacional defendiendo las banderas del presidente, y opositores en La Pampa, pegándole al gobierno peronista.
El voto del martes de la Ley Bases por parte de los diputados nacionales de La Pampa parece representar, casi como una prueba de laboratorio, lo que está ocurriendo en la calle: una sociedad dividida a favor o en contra de Milei. Los dos legisladores peronistas (Ariel Rauschenberger y Varinia Marín) lo hicieron en contra; los dos del PRO (Martín Ardohain y Martín Maquieyra) a favor; y la radical (Marcela Coli) hizo la gran «no me juego» y se abstuvo, disimulando que no está a favor, pero finalmente allanándole el camino al gobierno libertario.
Sin inmutarse, y con justificaciones en mano, la oposición pampeana avala en el Congreso lo que critica en la Legislatura provincial. Votaron el aumento de Ganancias (cuando apoyaron a un presidente que dijo que no iba a subir ningún impuesto) y se oponen al aporte extraordinario para el fondo de alimentos del gobernador Sergio Ziliotto.
Demoraron y luego no votaron la ley para poner en marcha la obra pública abandonada por Milei con el argumento de no darle un cheque en blanco al mandatario, pero votaron las facultades extraordinarias para el presidente.
Afirman que hay que darle al gobierno nacional la gobernabilidad necesaria para «sacar adelante el país», pero se oponen sistemáticamente al proyecto de la obra pública del gobierno provincial que beneficia a sus propios intendentes.
El arco opositor muestra en forma permanente esa doble personalidad. El PRO lo asume sin culpa, en el radicalismo haciéndose los desentendidos. Ese contraste entre lo que se dice y lo que se hace no implica tener una lucha interna, está justificada políticamente del lado de la grieta elegida: la de Milei.
Ese doble discurso no es solo cuestión de los dirigentes opositores. Se derrama también en la calle, entre quienes votaron a Milei convencidos o como instrumento para sacar al peronismo del gobierno.
Veamos algunos ejemplos con los que este columnista se ha cruzado. Una votante se quejaba de la salud pública, pero pide remedios en el hospital porque le subió la prepaga gracias a la desregulación mágica liberal. Un estudiante de la UNLPam no marcha en defensa de la Universidad pública porque «todos tienen que pagar el ajuste», pero está esperando cobrar la beca Progresar.
Una empleada pública critica a la almacenera del barrio porque los precios aumentan y vocifera que «son todos chorros», y falta una semana a su trabajo. Otro protesta en la cooperativa por el aumento en la boleta de luz, tarifa que no maneja la entidad, pero por las dudas ni llama a Camuzzi.
Delicias del país de la «libertad».

Article: Con el fin de frenar el impacto sobre la inflación, el Poder Ejecutivo publicará un Decreto en el Boletín Oficial, a través del cual se diferirá la fecha en la que tendrá efecto la actualización correspondiente al Impuesto a los Combustibles.
Además, el Ministerio de Economía decidió postergar los aumentos de tarifas de gas y electricidad que tendrían que haberse aplicada a partir de mayo.
A partir de este miércoles debía empezar a regir la fórmula de actualización mensual de las tarifas de gas y electricidad que el Gobierno diseñó para que los aumentos otorgados no queden atrasados respecto de la inflación.
Sin embargo, los entes reguladores de ambos servicios, Enargas y ENRE, respectivamente, no publicaron los nuevos cuadros tarifarios a la espera de una definición de Economía.
Los entes reguladores ya tienen calculado cuánto sería la suba que le correspondería a las empresas: 10,69% para las distribuidoras eléctricas, 12,5% para las distribuidoras de gas y 12% para las transportistas de gas.
Economía debía definir si avanzaba con una quita de subsidios para los sectores de ingresos bajos (N2) y medios (N3) en gas y electricidad; si aumentaba el costo que pagan los comercios, industrias y hogares de ingresos altos, y si autorizaba el ajuste mensual de tarifas para las empresas.
Al final, nada de esos sucederá y todo continuará como estaba o peor, ya que la inflación y la devaluación mensual se mantiene al ritmo del 7% y 2% mensual y cada vez más los usuarios residenciales de ingresos bajos y medios demandan más subsidios.
En cuanto a los combustibles, a partir de la norma que se publicará en el Boletín Oficial, el Gobierno definió diferir la actualización correspondiente al cuarto trimestre de 2023 de los Impuestos sobre los Combustibles y al Dióxido de Carbono para la nafta sin plomo, la nafta virgen y el gasoil, al 1° de junio de 2024.
De esta manera, la medida garantiza previsibilidad al sector y establece que no habrá incremento alguno, por dichos conceptos, en mayo.

Article: El Pincha reaccionó a tiempo, empató 1-1 con el Xeneize y desde los doce pasos se impuso por 3-1 para llegar a la definición del próximo domingo ante Vélez en el Estadio Único Madre de Ciudades.
A Boca se le escapó el triunfo ante Estudiantes y cayó por 3 a 1 en los penales, luego de igualar 1 a 1 en el tiempo reglamentario en el estadio Mario Alberto Kempes de Córdoba, por lo que el "Pincha" jugará la final de la Copa de la Liga frente a Vélez.
El "Xeneize", que fue notablemente superior a su rival en la etapa inicial y generó varias situaciones claras, se puso en ventaja a los 41 minutos con un tanto de Miguel Merentiel tras una asistencia de Luis Advíncula.
En la segunda parte, Cristian Lema revivió al conjunto platense a los 27 minutos al cometer una innecesaria infracción en el área: el defensor auriazul vio la tarjeta roja y le dio la chance al "Pincha" de empatar el encuentro con un potente remate de Edwuin Cetré desde los doce pasos.
Allí, Matías Mansilla le atajó los remates a Edinson Cavani y Nicolás Figal, mientras que Miguel Merentiel estrelló el suyo en el travesaño y solo Kevin Zenón convirtió en una errática tanda para el equipo de Diego Martínez.
Por su parte, Sergio Romero contuvo el disparo de Cetré, pero Eros Mancuso, Guido Carrillo y Mauro Méndez anotaron y le dieron el pasaje al "Pincha" a la final.
De esta manera, Estudiantes será el rival de Vélez, que eliminó por penales a Argentinos Juniors, en el duelo decisivo de la competencia que se disputará el próximo domingo desde las 15.30 en el Estadio Único Madre de Ciudades de Santiago del Estero.

Article: Medellín
Luego de conocer las cifras del Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE) sobre que el desempleo en Colombia aumentó, pasando de un 10% a 11.3% en el más reciente informe. Ante esta información, el alcalde de Medellín, Federico Gutiérrez, fue consultado y advirtió que esto podría estar relacionado con el manejo que le está dando al gobierno nacional a la economía del país.
Incluso el mandatario local advirtió que esta situación podría llevar al país a perder cerca de un millón de empleos en el sector de la construcción entre el 2024 y el 2025, recala que esto impactaría directamente a las regiones.
“¿Qué genera la incertidumbre? Genera falta de confianza, se cae la confianza inversionista. ¿Qué pasa cuando se cae la venta de vivienda en un país durante más de un año? Los efectos se empiezan a ver apenas ahora”.
Pero el mandatario continuó en su respuesta indicando que el presidente Gustavo Petro, debe enfocarse más en trabajar que en cazar discusiones y polémicas con diferentes sectores del país, para así poder recurar a la economía.
“¿Cuál es mi invitación al Gobierno Nacional? Menos conflicto, más diálogo y que nos dediquemos a trabajar para sacar el país adelante desde las regiones y que haya ejecución real, que esa ejecución llegue a los territorios, que los proyectos de infraestructura tienen que continuar, han frenado los proyectos de infraestructura, se siente la desaceleración económica, el país creció muy poquito el año pasado, este año se prevé también una tasa de crecimiento cercana al 1 o 1.5%, es muy bajo para un país como el nuestro y eso impacta en las regiones”.
¿Qué propone desde local el alcalde Fico?
El mandatario indica que la actual incertidumbre que está generando el actual gobierno nacional está generando la desaceleración económica del país, lo que a su vez está frenando los proyectos, según él, especialmente el de la infraestructura.
“Nosotros intentaremos con el sector productivo, con la inversión pública a través de infraestructura y políticas contracíclicas, cómo generar una buena inyección en temas de infraestructura a todo nivel, infraestructura social, compensar esa pérdida de empleo del sector construcción de vivienda. Y será importante trabajar juntos”.
Pese a este panorama que plantea el alcalde Gutiérrez, resaltó que Medellín actualmente está por debajo de la media nacional en desempleo, pero que no se puede confiar y solicitó a la empresa privada a trabajar de manera mancomunada.
Reporte del DANE
Las ciudades con el índice más alto de desocupación fueron en su orden: Quibdó 29.7%, Riohacha 17.4%, Florencia 17.4% y Popayán con un 15.9%. Entre tanto, Bogotá con el 10.6% y Villavicencio con el 10.8% son las ciudades con las menores tasas de desempleo.

Article: El árbitro cobró infracción del mediocampista del Pincha sobre el del Xeneize al borde del área.
El árbitro Nazareno Arasa cobró una dudosa infracción a favor de Boca de Enzo Pérez sobre el mediocampista Cristian Medina en el borde del área que pudo haber sido penal en la semifinal por la Copa de la Liga Profesional.
El volante central de Pérez tomó, supuestamente, por las espaldas a Medina dentro del área y este último se dejó caer. No obstante, Arasa decidió cobrar tiro libre para Boca y no desde el punto penal como le reclamó todo el equipo xeneize.
Desde la terna arbitral le preguntaron al árbitro principal si quería revisar la jugada en el VAR, ya que lo habían pedido desde el control, pero Arasa se negó a esto y continuó el partido tal y como lo sancionó.

A través de un video de TikTok, bajo el nombre @sofiapeleteiro1, la chica adjuntó las capturas y los audios que le envió a su amiga en WhatsApp tras ver cómo había quedado el dibujo que se había hecho. Rápidamente se volvió viral en la red social.
“Mirá amiga, yo me quería tatuar esto que no es muy complicado”, fue el audio que le envió Sofía a su amiga junto a una foto del tatuaje que tomó como referencia para hacerse, pero que terminó de la peor manera. “No paro de llorar”, lamentó.
Resulta que la chica había pedido que le tatúen un dibujo que simula ser de llamas de fuego en el cuello, pero no resultó como esperaba. “Yo quería un fuego, encima dije: ´me va a quedar re piola, un fuego en la garganta como que me quema la garganta de todas las cosas que tengo por decir´”, continuó Sofía mientras sollozaba en la nota de voz.
Seguido a eso, la joven comenzó a hacer comparaciones con el tatuaje y aseguró que tenía la forma de “pasto sin cortar” y también que le hacía parecer que le salían “pelos del pecho”.
En cuestión de pocas horas el video se volvió viral en la red social, ya que recolectó más de 400 mil ‘Me Gusta’ y miles de comentarios. “¿Qué justificación te dio el tatuador? Por Dios”, “No llores, lo podés tapar con un diseño más bonito”, “Como mínimo el tatuador debería pagarte las sesiones de laser para remover eso”, fueron algunas de las opiniones de otros usuarios.

Article: Desde el mes que comienza estaba contemplada una actualización automática de las tarifas, pero los entes reguladores no publicaron los nuevos cuadros.
El Gobierno Nacional definió que no se aplicarán los nuevos incrementos en las boletas de luz y gas que estaban previstos para mayo según confirmó una alta fuente del Ministerio de Economía. “No hay aumentos en mayo. Queremos consolidar la baja de la inflación y venimos bien con el superávit”, afirmó.
Se trata de la postergación de los mecanismos de indexación mensual que había definido la Secretaría de Energía, conducida por Eduardo Rodríguez Chirillo, para evitar un retraso en términos reales de los ingresos de las empresas distribuidoras y transportistas. Los mismo sucederá con la actualización del impuesto a los combustibles (ICL), con un impacto del 8% que se evaluaba dividir en dos tramos tal como había adelantado este medio, pero ahora no se hará efectiva.
Este noche, el Gobierno Nacional confirmó que publicará un Decreto en el Boletín Oficial, a través del cual se diferirá la fecha en la que tendrá efecto la actualización “correspondiente al cuarto trimestre de 2023 de los Impuestos sobre los Combustibles y al Dióxido de Carbono para la nafta sin plomo, la nafta virgen y el gasoil, al 1° de junio de 2024″.
En el caso de las tarifas de energía, el Enre y el Enargas aún no publicaron los cuadros tarifarios correspondientes al mes que inicia este miércoles. Fuentes oficiales comentaron que se evalúa la magnitud de las subas y cómo pueden aplicarse, tras los fuertes aumentos del 200% en electricidad y mayores al 300% en gas a los que se sumaron el agua (209%) además el transporte público (410%) durante el primer cuatrimestre.
“Se va a hacer, solo que puede demorarse un poco”, comentaron desde la Secretaría de Energía de la Nación.
En el sector fueron informados de cuál es lo que les corresponde aumentar, en base a las fórmulas polinómicas que se definieron tras las últimas actualizaciones de tarifas: serían 10,7% para las distribuidoras de electricidad, 12,5% para las de gas y 12% para el transporte de gas. El ministro de Economía, Luis Caputo, es quien tendrá la última palabra a la hora de aplicar las subas. Las empresas involucradas –Transener, Transba, Edenor, Edesur, TGN, TGS, Metrogas, Naturgy, Camuzzi, etcétera– esperaban un traslado en torno al 5% en las facturas finales.

Article: La estrategia fue definida en la noche de este martes. Se precisará ayuda opositora para tener los despachos listos y sancionarlos hacia mitad de mes. Es decir, antes del Pacto de Mayo.
Tras la aprobación de la Ley Ómnibus fileteada y el paquete fiscal en Diputados, el oficialismo acelerará el tratamiento de ambas iniciativas en el Senado e intentará tener los dictámenes de ambos proyectos entre el miércoles y jueves próximos. El ambicioso objetivo apunta a tener sancionados los textos antes del Pacto de Mayo, aunque La Libertad Avanza precisará de la ayuda de la oposición antikirchnerista, que ya direcciona la lupa a varios puntos aprobados horas atrás en la Cámara baja.
Con el feriado del 1 de mayo en el medio, el camino del aterrizaje de los proyectos debe atravesar primero los retoques finales en Diputados y la comunicación oficial al Senado. Esto se dará entre jueves y viernes. Una vez concretado dicho paso, en la Cámara alta se dispondrá el giro de las iniciativas a comisiones, un tema no menor para agilizar los tiempos y alinearse a los deseos de la Casa Rosada.
La Libertad Avanza pretende un debate similar al de Diputados. Es decir, una ley bases analizada por las comisiones de Legislación General -cabecera-; Presupuesto y Hacienda; y Asuntos Constitucionales. En tanto, la segunda estaría a cargo de abrazar el paquete fiscal.
Dos de las tres comisiones están presididas por oficialistas. Por caso, la de Legislación General está comandada por el puntano y presidente provisional del Senado, Bartolomé Abdala; mientras que la de Presupuesto la maneja el jefe del oficialismo, Ezequiel Atauche (Jujuy). En tanto, la de Asuntos Constitucionales tiene como titular al peronista disidente Edgardo Kueider (Entre Ríos).
Parte de la estrategia a seguir fue conversada horas atrás entre la vicepresidenta, Victoria Villarruel, y la secretaria general de Presidencia, Karina Milei, quienes almorzaron a solas en el comedor del Senado este martes, mientras Diputados definía el destino de las leyes en cuestión. También hablaron sobre los próximos viajes del jefe de Estado al exterior y el armado del partido libertario de cara a las elecciones de medio término de 2025, entre otros asuntos.
De cara al martes próximo se espera que las comisiones realicen una reunión informativa con funcionarios nacionales. Allí explicarán los detalles de ambas iniciativas, con un kirchnerismo que buscará replicar las críticas pinceladas en Diputados -con divisiones en algunos artículos- y legisladores de partidos provinciales que serán trascendentales para destrabar áreas delicadas de los textos. Uno de ellos es la reinstauración de Ganancias.
Para el miércoles, el oficialismo quiere iniciar la discusión entre los propios integrantes de las comisiones y agilizar los dictámenes, aunque abren una ventana para firmar los despachos al día siguiente. De esta manera, quedarían listos para llegar al recinto -se necesitan siete días reglamentarios, ya que no hay dos tercios para habilitarlos- el jueves 16 de mayo. En caso de trabarse, se demorarían una semana más, un límite al que no quiere exponerse el Ejecutivo por la cercanía con el Pacto de Mayo que impulsa Milei.
En caso de concretarse una sesión el 16, el Senado tendrá 48 horas de actividad legislativa plena. Es que, un día antes, expondrá en el Senado el jefe de Gabinete, Nicolás Posse, quien dará el primer informe de la gestión libertaria en la Cámara alta.
La disertación de Posse es esperada por toda la oposición y el funcionario comenzaría a cumplir con lo que dicta la Constitución, que impone la presentación del jefe de Gabinete una vez por mes en el Congreso, intercalando Cámaras. Los bloques ya le enviaron extensos cuestionarios que apuntan a energía, fondos universitarios -se agita una sesión-, obra pública, deudas con las provincias y observaciones a distintos Decretos de Necesidad y Urgencia (DNU) activados desde el inicio de la gestión libertaria.

Article: El accidente ocurrió la noche de este martes en el barrio Almirante Brown.
El conductor de una camioneta Ford Eco Sport (LKS-230), en aparente estado de ebriedad, protagonizó un accidente contra un auto Volkswagen Gol en el que viajaban cuatro ocupantes, entre ellos un menor. En una brusca maniobra, intentó darse a la fuga y el otro conductor impidió que se alejara, subiéndose al capot de la camioneta. Las imágenes fueron grabas por una lectora de Diario Panorama.
Fuentes policiales confirmaron que el accidente ocurrió este martes a la noche en cercanías de Independencia y Calle 15 del barrio Almirante Brown. El conductor de la camioneta fue identificado como Manuel Córdoba, quien circulaba de norte a sur. Ocasionales testigos confirmaron que Córdoba “quería pasar los vehículos por medio de los carriles haciendo maniobras de película”.
El conductor del Volkswagen (AA 516 GA), de apellido Villalba, circulaba de norte a sur y evitó un choque más violento al hacer una maniobra inmediata, según confirmaron los mismos testigos. El rodado menor sufrió daños en la parte trasera. Afortunadamente, todos los ocupantes del auto resultaron ilesos.
Por jurisdicción se hizo cargo personal de la Seccional Séptima. Según trascendió de fuentes ligadas al hecho, Villalba no presentaba aliento etílico, mientras que el conductor de la camioneta tenía 1.48 grados de alcohol en sangre, superando la mínima para circular.

Article: El defensor ya tenía tarjeta amarilla por una protesta previa que cansó al árbitro; luego metió una dura patada y complicó a su equipo.
El defensor Cristian Lema le pegó un planchazo en el área Edwuin Cetré y el árbitro Nazareno Arasa sancionó penal a favor del Estudiantes que el colombiano convirtió y empató por 1 a 1 el partido ante Boca por las semifinales de la Copa de la Liga Profesional.
Después de un centro de Eros Mancuso por la derecha, Lema levantó la pierna de manera muy peligrosa ante la cara de Cetré, y el árbitro tardó unos minutos en sancionar el penal a favor de Estudiantes. Además le mostró la segunda tarjeta amarilla al defensor.
Cetré se paró frente a Sergio Romero y con un derechazo arriba e inatajable le dio el empate por 1 a 1 al Pincha ante un Boca que no podía creer la tontería de Lema en un momento que no la estaba pasando mal. Lema ya tenía una amonestación por protestar y prácticamente se “echó solo”.

Article: Les premiers résultats officiels des élections législatives et régionales du lundi 29 avril sont attendus ce mardi ou mercredi.
Un peu plus de quatre millions d’électeurs étaient appelés aux urnes pour choisir leurs 113 députés et 179 conseillers régionaux.
Ces élections interviennent dans un climat de tension politique après l'adoption par le Parlement d’une nouvelle Constitution qui fait passer le pays d’un régime présidentiel à un régime parlementaire.
Le double scrutin s’est dans l’ensemble bien déroulé, selon les observateurs.
"Scrutin libre et transparent"
Une mission électorale de la Communauté des États sahélo-sahariens (CEN-SAD), chargée d'observer les élections, a jugé le scrutin "libre, équitable et transparent", lors d'une conférence de presse à Lomé mardi.
Les observateurs de la CEN-SAD ont évoqué "la transparence et la régularité du double scrutin du 29 avril", en estimant qu'il devait "être considéré comme libre, équitable et transparent" lors de ce point-presse.
Mais la participation aurait été faible, notamment dans la capitale Lomé. Cliquez sur l'image pour écouter l'analyse de Dany Ayida, expert en gouvernance.
La nouvelle Constitution
L'enjeu de ces législatives est particulièrement important puisque le chef du parti majoritaire à l'Assemblée nationale sera automatiquement nommé président du Conseil, une sorte de super-Premier ministre qui concentrera tous les pouvoirs.
Le rôle de Président de la République devient un simple titre honorifique.
L'opposition togolaise, qui dénonce le nouveau texte, y voit une manière pour l'actuel chef de l'Etat, Faure Gnassingbé, président depuis 2005 à la suite de son père resté près de 38 ans à la tête de l'Etat, de rester au pouvoir, sans avoir à se soumettre à la limitation du nombre de mandats présidentiels.

Article: L'ascension de Niang, qui succède au général Cheikh Sène, démontre une volonté de modernisation et d'adaptation aux défis contemporains. En effet, le nouveau chef du renseignement national possède un parcours impressionnant, avec des qualifications académiques de premier plan et une expérience professionnelle diversifiée. Diplômé de l'École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr en France, de l'Institut des hautes études de défense nationale (IHEDN) et de l'École de Guerre, Niang a également étudié aux États-Unis et en Tunisie, renforçant ainsi ses compétences dans les domaines militaire et stratégique.
Mais au-delà des compétences individuelles, les changements dans le paysage du renseignement sénégalais reflètent également une évolution plus large des politiques de sécurité en Afrique. L'héritage colonial a profondément influencé les structures et les objectifs du renseignement dans de nombreux pays africains, y compris le Sénégal. Autrefois utilisé pour consolider le pouvoir colonial et maintenir l'ordre social, le renseignement est désormais confronté à des défis plus complexes, tels que la lutte contre le terrorisme, la criminalité transnationale et les menaces cybernétiques.
Cependant, malgré ces avancées, des failles persistent dans le système de renseignement sénégalais. L'histoire du renseignement en Afrique est marquée par des lacunes structurelles et des défis opérationnels, notamment en ce qui concerne la collecte et l'analyse de renseignements précis et fiables. Les récents événements, tels que la prise de pouvoir au Mali en 2020, ont révélé des déficiences dans la compréhension des dynamiques régionales et la capacité à anticiper les menaces émergentes.
Pour relever ces défis, il est essentiel que le renseignement sénégalais s'adapte aux réalités du XXIe siècle. Cela implique non seulement d'investir dans des technologies de pointe et des infrastructures de cybersécurité, mais aussi de renforcer la coopération régionale et internationale en matière de renseignement. En outre, une réforme institutionnelle et une modernisation des méthodes de collecte et d'analyse sont nécessaires pour garantir l'efficacité et la légitimité du renseignement étatique dans un environnement en constante évolution.
En conclusion, les récentes nominations aux postes clés du renseignement sénégalais illustrent la volonté du gouvernement de s'adapter aux défis contemporains. Cependant, pour assurer la sécurité et la stabilité à long terme, il est impératif de combler les lacunes existantes et de moderniser les pratiques de renseignement afin de répondre aux menaces émergentes et de garantir la souveraineté nationale dans un monde de plus en plus complexe et interconnecté.

Tu as la casquette de responsable d’un groupe de Français, tu dois donc obligatoirement parler couramment le français. De plus, il faut que tu parles couramment ou presque la langue du pays dans lequel tu seras envoyé (anglais, espagnol, allemand, coréen, etc.).
À noter : en tant que leader, tu ne décides pas de la destination dans laquelle tu pars. Néanmoins, tu pourras lister les pays que tu souhaites par ordre de préférence.
Les expériences personnelles
Tes expériences personnelles seront également importantes pour te mettre en valeur lors de ta candidature !
D’un côté, avoir une première expérience professionnelle ou associative avec des enfants est un avantage, comme par exemple : avoir fait du baby-sitting, avoir donné des cours particuliers, avoir été meneur chez les scouts ou encore entraîneur dans un club de sport.
D’un autre côté, avoir de préférence une première expérience à l’étranger peut faire la différence. Que ce soit des voyages, des séjours linguistiques, des échanges universitaires ou bien des stages et jobs à l’étranger, il faut mentionner tout ça !
Les qualités (soft skills)
Pour espérer devenir Course Leader, tu dois faire preuve d’enthousiasme, d’organisation et avoir un leadership naturel, car gérer des adolescents n’est pas toujours évident ! Tu dois par ailleurs être responsable, adaptable dans toutes situations et savoir être réactif pour trouver des solutions en cas de problème.
Quelles sont les missions du Course Leader ?
Le rôle principal
Tu l’auras compris, le Course Leader est le représentant et le responsable d’un groupe d’étudiants français à l’étranger. Son rôle principal est d’être l’interlocuteur privilégié entre toutes les parties prenantes du séjour, c’est-à-dire, les jeunes, les bureaux EF en France, le staff local ou encore les familles d’accueil.
La priorité du Course Leader, ce sont les jeunes. Il est leur point d’ancrage en cas de problème et est garant du bien-être, de la sécurité et de l’intégration de ceux-ci.
Klara FORGACH, Course Leader depuis 2019, nous partageait : “Quand il y a un manque quelque part, un petit coup de blues ou un petit bobo (même quand ça va, on demande), on est là. Pour certains, c’est leur première expérience seul, sans les parents et ils retrouvent en nous un confort et un réconfort.“.
Le rythme de travail
Si tu souhaites t’engager en tant que Course Leader, sache qu’il ne faut pas compter ses heures de travail, et ce, même la nuit ! Effectivement, tu dois être disponible 24h/24, 7j/7 et tu n’as pas de jours de congé non plus.
Ton objectif est de faire en sorte que les participants aient la meilleure expérience possible, alors quels que soient leurs soucis du jour ou de la nuit, tu dois répondre présent.
Les missions quotidiennes
Aucune journée ne se ressemble alors pas de place à l’ennui et aux tâches répétitives !
Toutefois, voici une liste non-exhaustive des missions que tu seras amené à accomplir durant ton séjour :
- Organiser des réunions quotidiennes avec les étudiants pour communiquer les informations sur les activités, les horaires, les lieux de rencontres et les événements à venir. Le but étant aussi de promouvoir les activités et sorties afin d’encourager les étudiants à participer.
- Aider à l’organisation des activités et des excursions auxquelles les étudiants participent.
À noter : toutes les activités sont incluses pour les Course Leaders aussi ! C’est un des gros points positifs de ce job étudiant.
Jennifer GAVA, Course Leader entre 2012 et 2017, nous explique “avoir eu la chance de surfer en Californie, monter dans le London Eye au coucher du soleil, danser la country en Floride, mais aussi d’être propulsée dans Harry Potter et sur les traces de Games of Thrones.”. On peut aussi retrouver des activités plus classiques organisées par EF, comme des jeux, des chasses aux trésors, des rallyes photos, etc.
- Contrôler les présences quotidiennes et tenir à jour les registres et documents administratifs.
- Veiller à ce que les jeunes respectent les règles de sécurité ainsi que les codes de comportement EF.
Elles partagent leur expérience de Course Leader
Jennifer GAVA (Course Leader entre 2012 et 2017)
Je peux dire sans aucun doute que les 6 plus beaux étés de ma vie, EF me les a donnés.
Je suis heureuse d’avoir la tête remplie de souvenirs, je suis fière d’avoir rencontré certains de mes amis les plus proches, et je suis reconnaissante d’avoir grandi et de m’être épanouie tout en ayant progressé en anglais et appris chaque jour sur les autres et moi-même.
J’ai vu des adolescents grandir, tomber amoureux, être inspirés et captivés… et l’être après leur séjour. Je me suis marée avec Alex d’Autriche, j’ai fait les montagnes russes avec Caitlyn des États-Unis, chanté un karaoké avec Pablo d’Espagne et me suis déguisée en super héros avec Robert de Suède.
Je referai ce summer job chaque été, encore et encore…
Klara FORGACH (Course Leader depuis 2019)
Paradoxalement, ma meilleure anecdote, c’est les “au revoir”. Quand on me dit “Klara, tu m’as permis de passer le meilleur été de ma vie”, c’est là que je me rends compte qu’un séjour a été réussi.
En tant que leader, on est très sollicité. Les jeunes nous transmettent leurs peurs et leurs questions. Et c’est vrai qu’à la fin quand je reçois des petits textos “Merci, j’ai adoré ce séjour-là”, honnêtement, c’est ça qui me fait revenir chaque année. C’est de voir qu’ils ont passé un été génial. C’est ça, mes plus beaux souvenirs.
Alors toi aussi, cette expérience t’attire ? C’est maintenant qu’il faut envoyer ta candidature à EF !

Article: Le Rotaract, bien plus qu’un BDE !
Et si la vie étudiante au sein de votre école ne se limitait pas aux soirées d’intégration et aux challenges sportifs ? C’est en tout cas ce que promet le Rotaract Club ITIC Paris ; où engagements solidaires et causes humanitaires côtoient les initiatives de rencontres professionnelles. Maxime et Marine, respectivement Président et Vice-Présidente du club, nous en parlent.
Article rédigé en partenariat avec ITIC Paris.
Qu’est-ce que le Rotaract ?
Le Rotaract est une association parrainée et supervisée par le Rotary Club International et destinée aux jeunes étudiants et professionnels entre 18 et 35 ans. Les objectifs de cette association sont de mener des actions caritatives à l’échelle locale et internationale, d’étendre son réseau personnel et professionnel, ainsi que de développer ses compétences.
Présent dans 189 pays, le Rotaract se subdivisent en clubs à taille humaine dont les adhérents se mobilisent au service des autres à travers des projets sociaux, humanitaires ou encore environnementaux.
La Rotaract Club ITIC Paris vu par les membres
Convaincue de l’importance d’une vie étudiante rythmée d’opportunités et de rencontres, l’école ITIC Paris va au-delà du simple BDE en offrant à ses étudiants une véritable vie associative ! Mais pas seulement, le Rotaract, c’est aussi la possibilité de rencontrer des entreprises afin de trouver un stage, une alternance, son futur job ou bien monter son projet entrepreneurial. Le tout dans une atmosphère bienveillante et solidaire. Nous avons interrogé Maxime MERCIER et Marine DA CUNHA, respectivement Président et Vice-Président du Rotaract Club ITIC Paris pour en savoir plus.
Comment intégrer le Rotaract de ITIC Paris et quelles sont les missions proposées aux étudiants ?
Maxime MERCIER – Partout dans l’école, il y a des flash codes à scanner ou même sur le compte Instagram @rotaractiticparis. Il suffit d’envoyer un message et de venir à au moins une des deux réunions mensuelles. Lors de ces réunions, on va discuter des actions à venir et de sujets divers. Par exemple, une fois quelqu’un est venu faire une super présentation sur le don de moelle osseuse pour expliquer ce que c’est, comment y participer et surtout lever certains tabous.
Ce qu’il faut savoir, c’est que le Rotaract est international. Alors, nous allons jouer en échelle, nous avons notre club au sein de l’école, mais ne serait-ce que sur la région Île-de-France, il y a beaucoup de clubs avec lesquels nous allons faire plein d’actions. Notamment, début avril, une de nos étudiantes va nous représenter au concours d’éloquence regroupant tous les clubs d’île-de-France.
Marine DA CUNHA – Ce qui est super sympa, c’est que lors de ces réunions, on a souvent de nouvelles personnes qui viennent pour découvrir ce qu’est le Rotaract et les actions que l’on va mettre en place.
C’est qui est cool, c’est que parfois, certains ont besoin d’aide pour leur recherche d’alternance ou de stage et étant donné qu’on bénéficie d’un réseau très large, cela nous permet de les aider.
Le Rotaract est perçu comme un club élitiste, est-ce vrai ?
Maxime MERCIER – C’est un des préjugés qui colle à la peau du Rotaract, ce côté élitiste alors que pas du tout. Souvent, on dit que ce qu’il faut pour faire de l’humanitaire, c’est de l’argent, mais quand on est étudiant, on en a pas forcément. Ce qu’on va rechercher chez les étudiants, c’est de consacrer du temps.
En décembre, par exemple, nous avons organisé une banque alimentaire, donc on ne demande pas aux étudiants d’investir de l’argent, d’acheter des courses, mais d’être présents lors des collectes dans les magasins, etc. Autre exemple, le don du sang, c’est une action humanitaire aussi qui permet de sauver des vies. Pour rappel, un don peut sauver 3 vies.
Il y a plein de micro actions comme celles-ci qui permettent de réaliser de grandes choses. Mais, on a aussi de très gros projets ! Actuellement, nous préparons pour le mois de mai un voyage humanitaire au Bénin, donc on cherche des étudiants pour nous accompagner et des entreprises pour nous sponsoriser. Cette mission humanitaire participe à la préservation du patrimoine mondial de l’humanité, donc ce n’est pas rien. Au Bénin, il y a une région qui s’appelle l’Atacora. C’est une région montagneuse avec des maisons classées au patrimoine historique. Nous allons là-bas pour aider à la restauration de ces maisons et en même temps découvrir cette région qui actuellement est en partenariat avec l’Ambassade de France pour faire un reportage sur l’Atacora.
Concrètement, s’engager dans le Rotaract ça implique quoi ?
Marine DU CUNHA – Dans l’idéal, on aimerait que tous les membres puissent venir à nos réunions bi-mensuelles. Mais, ce qui importe, c’est la motivation et l’engagement. C’est d’être là, quand on a besoin de mettre en place les actions et pour toute la réalisation qu’il y a autour.
Autre chose, à la fin de leur cursus à ITIC Paris, les étudiants pensent qu’ils quittent le Rotaract, alors que pas du tout ! C’est possible de rester membre et de continuer à mener des actions comme si on était étudiant. Et puis même après, au-delà de 35 ans, il est possible d’intégrer le Rotary Club International.
Maxime MERCIER – Et puis, même si on déménage, le réseau du Rotaract est partout en France. Alors pourquoi ne pas aller rencontrer un club Rotaract. Nous sommes tous liés par le même principe « l’amitié par le service ».
Comment s’organise le mentorat du Rotaract de ITIC Paris ?
Marine DU CUNHA – Récemment une étudiante est venue nous voir, car elle avait des difficultés en marketing. Grâce au Rotaract et ses partenaires, nous avons plein de professionnels qui peuvent l’aider. Et même au-dessus pour les stages et les alternances, on peut facilement trouver des entreprises prêtent à les accueillir.
Maxime MERCIER – Même entre nous, on a des étudiants de toutes les filières et de tous les niveaux.
Quelle est la place et le rôle de ITIC Paris dans le Rotaract ?
Maxime MERCIER – On a de la chance, on est très appuyé par l’école, mais elle nous laisse une certaine marge de liberté. Le club Rotaract dépend de l’école, mais on a pas besoin d’être de l’école pour y participer.
Un petit mot pour la fin ?
Maxime MERCIER – N’hésitez pas à nous rejoindre. L’idée, c’est de pouvoir faire de l’humanitaire ! Venez chez nous, nous allons monter des projets humanitaires de A à Z sans avoir aucune connaissance de ce que c’est et on va monter tout le projet en partant de rien. En étant à ITIC Paris, vous faites vos études et à côté vous arrivez aussi à monter des projets humanitaires.

Article: French Days – L'aspirateur balai Dyson Gen5 Detect "5 étoiles" à 753,99 € (-16%)
L'aspirateur-balai Dyson Gen5 Detect est le premier modèle du britannique muni du nouveau moteur Hyperdimium. Il conserve par ailleurs ce qui a fait le succès de la marque au fil du temps : une filtration multicyclonique et de nombreuses astuces.

Est-il raisonnable de dépenser autant dans un produit aussi peu ludique qu'un aspirateur-balai ? Chacun répondra à cette question selon son expérience, ses attentes, ses envies et, bien sûr, son compte en banque. Il y a d'ailleurs fort à parier que les débats à ce sujet iront bon train. Mais une chose est sûre : si on ne juge que l'efficacité, les performances et la facilité d'entretien, le Dyson Gen5 Detect n'a aucun concurrent. Il ne laisse rien passer et enferme la poussière et les plus petites particules dans son collecteur, qui se montre en plus aisé à vider. Ce qui ne gâche rien, de petites astuces comme l'indication précise de l'autonomie ou le nouveau suceur intégré facilitent vraiment la vie, tandis que l'entretien de l'appareil ne demande presque aucun effort. Alors oui, le Dyson Gen5 Detect approche d'un cheveu la barre fatidique des 1000 €, mais il les vaut amplement.
Points forts
- Excellentes performances d'aspiration, même en mode éco.
- Filtration parfaite.
- Affichage de l'autonomie à la seconde près.
- Système Point&Shoot inégalable.
- Suceur intégré dans le tube d'aspiration.
Points faibles
- Un peu lourd.
- Toujours aussi bariolé (mais certains apprécient).
NB : La baisse de prix rapportée est calculée en comparant le prix le plus bas du jour avec la moyenne des prix les plus bas pratiqués par tous les marchands pour le produit le mois dernier, avec des règles de sécurité pour écarter les prix des boutiques dont la politique en matière de TVA n’est pas claire (dites boutiques “grises”, typiquement en cas d’import de Chine).

Avec son V15 Detect Absolute, Dyson ne crée pas de mauvaise surprise. On ne peut rien lui reprocher au sujet de l'aspiration, de la filtration ou de l'entretien ; la Sainte-Trinité de l'aspirateur-balai. Pourtant, il y a comme un petit goût de "peut mieux faire". Certes, il n'est pas toujours facile d'innover efficacement, mais le laser s'apparente à une fonction gadget et l'ancienne brosse intelligente "High Torque" avait finalement peu ou prou la même mission que le compteur de particules, à savoir adapter la puissance d'aspiration automatiquement. Nous aurions préféré que Dyson s'attaque au poids de l'appareil, ou à son autonomie un brin limitée en mode Boost à notre goût.

Le Philips PowerPro Expert FC9729/09 est un aspirateur-traîneau sans sac semblable au Philips FC9745/09. Différence : il n'est livré qu'avec une brosse pour sol dur en plus de la brosse classique, tout en optant pour le rouge.

Le Philips PowerPro Expert FC9729/09 est un aspirateur-traîneau sans sac efficace sur tous les types de sols. Contrairement au modèle FC9745/09 qui se dote de multiples accessoires, celui-ci n'est livré qu'avec une brosse sol dur pour aspirer, comme son nom l'indique, sur les sols durs et les parquets. Cet aspirateur-traîneau fait preuve d'une bonne maniabilité qui le rend agréable à utiliser.
Points forts
- Excellentes performances d'aspiration sur tous les types de sols.
- Capacité confortable du collecteur.
Points faibles
- Filtre mousse très vite encrassé de poussières (il faudra le nettoyer régulièrement).
NB : La baisse de prix rapportée est calculée en comparant le prix le plus bas du jour avec la moyenne des prix les plus bas pratiqués par tous les marchands pour le produit le mois dernier, avec des règles de sécurité pour écarter les prix des boutiques dont la politique en matière de TVA n’est pas claire (dites boutiques “grises”, typiquement en cas d’import de Chine).

Soyons clairs, le Rowenta Swift Power Cyclonic RO2933EA ne casse pas trois pattes à un canard. Il fait le travail qu'on lui demande et n'offre que le strict nécessaire : pas d'accessoire ni variateur de puissance d'aspiration. Pour autant, ce petit aspirateur sans sac ne démérite pas et présente des performances d'aspiration honorables à un prix très attractif. Pour plus de fonctionnalités à un prix quasiment similaire, on s'orientera plutôt vers le Moulinex Compact Power Cyclonic MO3723PA.

Efficacité du mixage
Magimix démontre encore une fois son expertise pour tout ce qui coupe, tranche, et pulvérise dans une cuisine avec ce Blender Power 5 Connect. Aussi à l'aise pour préparer un smoothie que pour piler de la glace, il paraît près à endurer des années d'utilisation sans flancher. Attention tout de même à bien le refermer avant de lancer un mixage, car aucune sécurité ne viendra éviter les catastrophes si le couvercle n'est pas en place pendant l'opération.
Points forts
- Beau produit aux finitions impeccables.
- Efficacité du mixage.
- Simplicité de l'entretien.
Points faibles
- Bol un peu lourd.
- Pas de sécurité sur le couvercle.

Facile à nettoyer grâce à son couteau amovible, le Perfect Mix Cook LM835D10 de Moulinex est un excellent blender chauffant, qui arrive en plus à réaliser des smoothies à la texture parfaite. Les amateurs éclairés regretteront peut-être de ne pas pouvoir modifier manuellement la vitesse de rotation des lames en cours de mixage, mais ce modèle polyvalent possède suffisamment d'atouts pour qu'on lui pardonne ce petit défaut.

La brosse à dents Philips Sonicare DiamondClean HX9911 est une version allégée de la DiamondClean Smart HX9954/53. Elle n'est livrée qu'avec un verre de charge, le câble de recharge ainsi que le boitier de voyage. Ce modèle ne propose qu'une seule tête de brosse, ce qui lui fait perdre une étoile en commodité d'emploi. Néanmoins, cette brosse à dents est un très bon modèle connecté. Reliée à une application, elle délivre des informations pour améliorer son brossage quotidien.
Points forts
- Reconnaissance automatique des brossettes.
- Évolution ergonomique bienvenue (deux boutons).
- Design (bel objet, agréable à utiliser).
- Détection de la pression.
- Détection des mouvements et de l'homogénéité de brossage (via l'application).
- Application riche en informations.
Points faibles
- Interface de l'application peu intuitive (trop d'informations qui pourraient être mieux classées).
- Brossettes chères pour profiter des fonctions intelligentes.

La technologie sonique est réputée pour prendre mieux soin des dents et gencives que son pendant oscillo-rotatif, mais Neopulse souhaite aller plus loin. Lors du brossage, nous avons senti une réelle différence avec la plupart des concurrents de la marque française : la tête de brossage est fine, accède à tous les recoins et nettoie en douceur grâce à des poils très souples. Surtout, l'extrême faiblesse du niveau sonore de la brosse doit être saluée, rendant que plus agréable le brossage. L’affichage des modes et intensités directement sur le manche est appréciable, même si l’éclairage des diodes n’est pas toujours aisé à déchiffrer. Enfin, nous aurions aimé un étui “en dur” pour transporter la Neosonic, tout comme la possibilité de faire une pause lors du brossage, sans avoir à redémarrer un nouveau chronomètre.

La SoundLink Flex est une enceinte portable baroudeuse aboutie qui respecte parfaitement ses engagements en matière de facilité d’utilisation et de robustesse. Ses performances sonores ne sont pas irréprochables, notamment lorsqu’on la pousse à fort volume, mais la prestation fournie n’en reste pas moins solide. Ce modèle satisfera les mélomanes en quête d’un compagnon d’écoute simple, efficace et solide, en somme.
Points forts

- Extension généreuse dans les basses…
- Conception soignée, robuste et étanche (IP67).
- Très agréable à prendre en main et à utiliser.
- Connexion multipoint.

Si les Galaxy Buds Pro premiers du nom n’avaient pas tout à fait l’étoffe des plus grands, les Galaxy Buds2 Pro ont dorénavant ce qu’il faut pour se revendiquer comme tels. Si l’on omet la perte de performance sur le kit mains-libres (dommage...), la seconde version pousse encore plus loin l’expérience d’écoute, la réduction de bruit active, la qualité de conception et la durée d’utilisation, pour un résultat globalement très satisfaisant. Tout n'est cela pas parfait — on pense notamment au manque de polyvalence d’utilisation et aux fonctionnalités quelque peu limitées —, mais on s’en approche grandement. Comme précédemment, on recommandera surtout ces Galaxy Buds2 Pro aux aficionados de Samsung, qui pourront goûter à toutes les fonctionnalités de ces écouteurs.
Points forts
- Bel équilibre sonore, graves très profonds, aigus très amples.
- Sonorité propre, définie et précise.
- Très bonne reproduction de la scène stéréo.
- Conception soignée, très compacte, robuste (certification IPX7).
- Grande efficacité de la réduction de bruit active.
- Confortables, bon maintien.
Points faibles
- Des extrêmes graves qui débordent un peu, brillance des aigus un poil trop prononcée.
- Performances en retrait du kit mains-libres.
- Pas de prise en charge complète sur iOS, application un peu chiche en options de personnalisation.
- Des commandes plus nombreuses n'auraient pas été de trop.

Avec ses Galaxy Buds Pro, Samsung élève enfin son niveau de jeu sur le terrain des écouteurs true wireless. Seuls quelques menus défauts sur le plan de la reproduction audio les privent de justesse de leur 5e étoile. On n'a toutefois aucun mal à les recommander, en particulier aux utilisateurs de smartphones Samsung Galaxy, avec lesquels les Buds Pro exprimeront leur plein potentiel d'un point de vue fonctionnel.

La nouvelle interface des lave-linge Samsung qu'on retrouve sur le WW90T554DTW et sur le WW90T684DLH est une belle réussite esthétique et ergonomique. Les cycles simples se programment facilement, tandis que les utilisateurs plus exigeants trouveront quand même une foule d'options à paramétrer pour aller un peu plus loin dans l'usage de leur lave-linge. Comme souvent chez Samsung, l'efficacité de rinçage est au rendez-vous, même s'il est nécessaire d'enclencher la fonction "rinçage plus", gourmande en eau, pour en profiter. On regrette toutefois un peu que ce modèle soit moins performant contre les taches très incrustées qu'il ne l'est pour retirer les résidus de lessive des fibres textiles.
Points forts
- Nouvelle interface séduisante.
- Facile à programmer.
- Option "rinçage plus" toujours aussi performante.

- En difficulté face aux taches les plus incrustées.
- Parfois gourmand en eau.

Facile à programmer et à remplir, il séduira les personnes à la peau sensible aux résidus de lessive grâce à un rinçage tellement performant que l'option "plus d'eau" (pourtant très aquavore) n'a finalement pas beaucoup d'influence. Néanmoins, il n'est pas exempt de tout défaut et la longueur de ses programmes et un essorage perfectible jouent légèrement en sa défaveur.

Article: French Days – Le nettoyeur de sol Bissell CrossWave "5 étoiles" à 199,99 € (-19%)
Similaire à la version sans fil 2582N, mais avec un câble à la patte, le Bisselle Crosswave promet d'aspirer les sols et de les nettoyer dans le même mouvement grâce à son rouleau serpillière et à ses deux réservoirs, dont un pour l'eau sale.

Le Bissell Crosswave se voit relié au secteur, mais il demeure identique au modèle sans fil 2582N que nous avons testé en détail. On retrouve donc un appareil plutôt lourd et imposant qui souffre principalement de son manque de polyvalence puisqu'il se destine presque exclusivement à l'entretien des sols durs. De plus, sa filtration des poussières fines laisse à désirer, un vrai point faible pour un aspirateur, fonction qu'il endosse pourtant. Heureusement, même s'il laisse un peu trop d'humidité à notre goût après son passage, il se montre plutôt à l'aise pour nettoyer les sols grâce à sa large serpillière. Bon point, son système de double réservoir permet de ne pas laver les surfaces avec de l'eau sale, un vrai plus.
Points forts
- Appareil trois-en-un qui lave le sol à l'eau.
- Système de nettoyage automatique du circuit d'eau.
- À l'aise sur sols durs et moquettes fines.
Points faibles
- Manque de polyvalence.
- Lourd.
- Peu maniable.
- Filtration à revoir.

Le Looper de Vileda n’est pas un nettoyeur de sol comme les autres. L’utilisateur doit être pro-actif et pulvériser lui-même l’eau au sol. La serpillère électrique possède une seule vitesse et un seul réservoir d’eau (propre). Malgré ces fonctionnalités basiques, le Looper a fait ses preuves en parvenant à nettoyer correctement le sol de notre laboratoire. Sa facilité d’utilisation et son faible niveau sonore en font définitivement un appareil du quotidien.

Véritable modèle d'ergonomie, le nettoyeur de sol FC 7 de Kärcher cumule les bons points : il est maniable, léger, silencieux et il nettoie efficacement le sol sans trop l'inonder. L'autonomie est un peu en berne, mais on lui pardonne facilement cette faiblesse tant ses 4 rouleaux remplissent parfaitement leur office. C'est tout simplement un excellent nettoyeur de sol.
Points forts
- Position parking.
- Appareil léger.
- Mode Boost.
- Deux niveaux d'humidification.
- Deux réservoirs d'eau (propre et sale).
- Filtres à cheveux.
- Système de nettoyage automatique.
- Efficacité de lavage.
Points faibles
- Détergeant Kärcher uniquement.
- Bac de récupération d'eau sale ouvert.
- Les rouleaux peuvent se faire la malle.

Article: French Days – Le boîtier photo Sony Alpha 7 IV (A7 IV) Kit 28-70mm f/3.5-5.6 "5 étoiles" à 2 599,00 €

Avec l'Alpha 7 IV (A7 IV), Sony frappe un grand coup. Les corrections, ajustements et autres améliorations sont bien là, autant sur un plan logiciel qu'ergonomique. Toujours à la pointe de la performance dans la gestion de l'autofocus et du suivi du sujet, cette très bonne prestation est à mettre en parallèle d'une définition de l'image qui augmente. Si quelques pingreries sont toujours à déplorer, difficile de ne pas placer l'Alpha 7 IV (A7 IV) comme un excellent appareil à tout faire. Porté par une partie vidéo largement améliorée et un mode photo toujours très efficace, l'Alpha 7 IV (A7 IV) se positionne comme une référence sur son segment.
Points forts
- Stabilisation du capteur.
- Viseur électronique de qualité.
- Bonne gestion de la sensibilité.
- Enregistrement 4:2:2 10 bits en interne.
- Pas de recadrage en 4K UHD à 30 i/s.
- Détection et suivi AF des visages ou des yeux (humain, animaux, oiseaux) en photo et vidéo.
- Écran tactile sur rotule.
- Connectique (double logement SD, prise USB Type-C...)
- Fonctions de personnalisation.
- Prise de vue pendant l'alimentation.
- Résistance à l'humidité et à la poussière.
Points faibles
- Le mode Rafale limité à 10 i/s.
- Obturateur électronique limité au 1/8000 s.
- Temps de démarrage et enchaînement de photo limité.
- Fort recadrage en 4K UHD à 60 i/s et absence du format vidéo cinéma DCI.
- Rolling shutter en 4K.

Avec le Lumix S5 II, Panasonic propose un boîtier bien fini, très polyvalent et enfin doté d'un autofocus très performant. Un appareil à l'aise en photo et redoutable en vidéo, qui saura satisfaire le plus grand nombre. On pourra toujours mettre en avant un suivi AF un léger cran en dessous de la concurrence, ou encore une autonomie plus légère, mais force est de constater que la présence de Panasonic sur le marché du 24x36 se bonifie grandement avec ce S5 II.

Le XLR8 CS3140 de PNY est un SSD M.2 très rapide, qui offre d’excellents débits réels, même si certains concurrents haut de gamme font mieux, notamment en écriture. C’est donc un bon compagnon pour augmenter le stockage de son PC ou de sa PS5, mais attention, il faut absolument l’utiliser avec un dissipateur pour lui assurer des débits corrects.

Facile à utiliser avec ses commandes directes, la plaque à induction Sauter SPI9544B ne déçoit pas non plus sur le plan des performances. Les trois feux qu’elle propose, avec pour chacun 14 niveaux de puissance dont deux mémorisables, un boost et une fonction "Boil", lui garantissent une certaine polyvalence. Le plus grand permet une montée en température rapide, quand le plus petit se montre adapté aux aliments plus fragiles. La plaque de Sauter peut en outre se targuer d’être assez silencieuse et économe en énergie. Un excellent choix en somme pour qui ne cherche pas de zones jumelables, comme en propose, pour une centaine d’euros supplémentaires toutefois, la Samsung NZ63N9777GK.

Le Pixel 7 Pro confirme la bonne copie rendue l'an dernier par le Pixel 6 Pro. Le smartphone peaufine une formule qui fait mouche : Google y place un écran Oled très lumineux, une puce Tensor G2 puissante et un équipement photo qui en fait un des terminaux les plus polyvalents. Android 13 a droit à des raffinements particuliers (transcription de messages vocaux, VPN gratuit) qui servent ce matériel réussi. On regrette bien sûr que le smartphone ne fasse pas mieux en matière d'autonomie et de charge rapide, domaine dans lesquels Google n'accomplit pas de miracle, et on peut cette année encore reprocher au terminal son design un peu massif. Mais ces éléments ne suffisent pas, à notre sens, à assombrir ce très convaincant tableau.

L'Edge 50 Pro livre une prestation généreuse pour sa gamme de prix. Il ne manque pas grand-chose au smartphone pour se hisser sur le segment haut de gamme, qui se caractérise à ce jour par un volet photo plus perfectionné, par une débauche de puissance et par des fonctions liées à l'intelligence artificielle. Si tout cela ne concerne pas vraiment le smartphone de Motorola, il propose bon nombre d'atouts propres à séduire : un écran lumineux et bien calibré, un bloc photo polyvalent, à défaut d'être à 100 % parfait, une bonne autonomie et un fonctionnement fluide. À tout cela s'ajoutent des raffinements appréciables, tel le support de l'eSIM, une certification IP68 et un poids pas trop élevé. Bref, un ensemble solide servi par un design soigné, à réserver aux amateurs de designs tout en courbes.

Le Samsung TQ55S95C est un excellent téléviseur parfaitement calibré en SDR et HDR. La technologie QD-Oled est sublimée avec un pic de luminosité qui peut concurrencer les meilleurs TV Mini-Led et Oled. Cela se traduit à l'image par des images HDR encore plus réalistes. Le S95C se différencie avant tout par son design plat ultra-fin et sa connectique déportée qui facilitent l'installation au mur. Il s'impose d'ores et déjà comme une référence sur le marché et conviendra aussi bien aux amateurs de cinéma qu'aux férus de jeu vidéo.

Article: Mimi Marchand lors des obsèques de Bernard Tapie à Paris 6 octobre 2021
"Mimi" Marchand a-t-elle obtenu 1.600 euros de Karine Le Marchand pour que des photos gênantes de la fille de l'animatrice TV soient étouffées ? Le parquet de Paris demande que la "papesse des paparazzis" soit jugée pour extorsion aux côtés de l'une des stars du métier, Sébastien Valiela, et de deux policiers.
Une source proche du dossier a indiqué mardi à l'AFP que le ministère public avait requis le 19 avril ce procès devant le tribunal correctionnel.
Karine Le Marchand avait déposé plainte mi-février 2020 à la police des polices en indiquant qu'une "source" de sa connaissance avait évité de justesse la publication de photos de sa fille sortant de garde à vue contre le paiement de 3.000 euros. A l'époque, l'animatrice de "L'amour est dans le pré" (M6) n'avait pas mentionné le nom de sa source, Michèle Marchand.
Les deux femmes se sont vues quelques jours plus tard lors d'un déjeuner où celle qui a aussi animé "Une ambition intime" ou "Les Maternelles" a remis 1.600 euros pour entamer le remboursement de ce "service".
D'après des éléments des réquisitions dont l'AFP a eu connaissance, le parquet estime que "Mimi" Marchand serait ensuite "devenue plus pressante voire menaçante par insinuation en lui indiquant, alors que Karine Lemarchand ne se rendait pas disponible et ne lui avait pas versé la totalité de la somme évoquée (3.000 euros) lors de leur premier échange: +Ce sera trop tard... c'est embêtant pour la petite+".
En interrogatoire, Mimi Marchand, 77 ans, a contesté toute forme de pression et indiqué que c'était Karine Le Marchand qui avait "insisté" pour qu'elle prenne l'argent.
Celle qui est connue pour avoir été proche des couples Macron et Sarkozy a expliqué avoir relancé Karine Le Marchand par téléphone afin qu'elle prépare une réponse si l'affaire sortait dans la presse. Mais la justice la soupçonne au contraire d'avoir oeuvré à récupérer les photos pour exercer ce chantage.

Début mars, Karine Le Marchand a encore déploré sur Instagram des fuites dans la presse people concernant sa fille. "Avoir 21 ans n'est pas facile. Être ma fille non plus. Je suis désolée que ma notoriété ne t'épargne rien", a-t-elle écrit à son attention.
Sollicitée par l'AFP, Me Caroline Toby a indiqué qu'elle avait fait des observations aux fins de non-lieu pour sa cliente "Mimi" Marchand.
Les photos avaient été prises par Sébastien Valiela.
Ce paparazzo, pour qui le parquet demande un procès pour corruption et recel de violation du secret professionnel, est connu pour avoir pris les photos de Mazarine Pingeot avec son père François Mitterrand, publiées dans Paris Match en 1994; il a aussi réalisé les clichés volés de François Hollande et Julie Gayet publiés en janvier 2014 par Closer.
Le parquet demande également un procès pour l'un de ses informateurs supposés, le policier Marc M., 45 ans, qui pourrait être jugé pour violation du secret professionnel. Un policier décédé en 2022 a également été mis en cause.
En raison de liens entre les protagonistes, ce volet a été joint à un dossier emblématique: l'enquête ouverte après la diffusion par Paris Match en février 2020 de photos et d'une vidéo montrant le Russe Piotr Pavlenski allongé à plat ventre sur le sol, les mains entravées par des menottes.
Deux jours auparavant, Piotr Pavlenski avait revendiqué la diffusion de vidéos à caractère sexuel de Benjamin Griveaux, alors candidat LREM à la mairie de Paris, précipitant son retrait de la bataille des municipales le 14 février 2020.

Marc M. et un autre policier, David O., 55 ans, sont soupçonnés d'avoir renseigné Sébastien Valiela sur l'interpellation à venir de Piotr Pavlenski et de sa compagne Alexandra de Taddeo. A un moment où les policiers avaient fait une pause dans leur filature, le paparazzo les aurait renseignés.
Si la juge d'instruction à qui appartient la décision finale sur un procès suit l'avis du parquet, Marc M. pourrait être également jugé pour faux en écriture publique pour ces faits, car il est soupçonné d'avoir falsifié un procès-verbal pour masquer le rôle-clé de Sébastien Valiela dans l'épisode.
Le parquet n'a toutefois pas demandé que soit retenue une circonstance aggravante qui aurait pu mener ce dossier en cour criminelle départementale.
Les avocats de Mme Le Marchand, partie civile dans ce dossier, de Sébastien Valiela, Marc M. et David O. n'ont pas répondu à l'AFP.

Article: Un supermarché Casino, le 12 juin 2023 à Laventie, dans le Pas-de-Calais
Le distributeur Casino, en proie à de graves difficultés financières, a indiqué mardi avoir vendu 121 magasins grand format à ses concurrents Auchan, Carrefour et Les Mousquetaires sur les 287 prévus.
"Le groupe Casino annonce aujourd'hui la vente de 121 magasins", "conformément" aux accords conclus le 24 janvier avec Auchan et le groupement Les Mousquetaires, et le 8 février avec Carrefour.
"Cette transaction est réalisée sur la base d'une valeur d'entreprise des magasins cédés de 698 millions d'euros", précise le communiqué de Casino, qui a changé de mains fin mars et a désormais pour actionnaires principaux Daniel Kretinsky, Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière et le fonds Attestor.
L'endettement du groupe contracté par la précédente direction l'avait poussée à multiplier les cessions, y compris la vente de la quasi-totalité des magasins grand format, une activité qui constituait pourtant le cœur historique de Casino.
Dans le détail, Les Mousquetaires ont racheté mardi 65 magasins et un drive, Auchan 32 magasins et Carrefour 23 magasins. "Les cessions des 166 magasins restants interviendront en deux étapes, le 31 mai 2024 et le 1er juillet 2024", est-il précisé dans le communiqué.
Alors que le démantèlement de Casino - qui regroupe des enseignes bien connues des Français, comme Monoprix et Franprix - suscite des craintes parmi ses salariés, le groupe a tenu à rappeler que les trois acheteurs "se sont engagés à reprendre l'ensemble des contrats de travail" affectés aux magasins transférés.
Auchan, Carrefour et Les Mousquetaires ont aussi promis de "maintenir les dispositions et avantages résultant du statut collectif Casino pour une durée minimale de 15 mois à compter de la date de réalisation de la cession".
Pour les salariés qui ne sont eux pas concernés par ces trois vagues de cession, l'avenir est plus incertain.
Le "projet de réorganisation", présenté la semaine dernière aux représentants du personnel, prévoit de réduire les effectifs de Casino de 1.300 à 3.200 postes, une fourchette large en attendant de savoir le nombre de magasins et d'entrepôts qui pourront encore être repris d'ici septembre.

Article: Des manifestants pro-palestiniens assis à l'extérieur d'un bâtiment occupé de l'université Columbia à New York (est des Etats-Unis), le 30 avril 2024
La prestigieuse université Columbia à New York, épicentre du mouvement pro-palestinien contre la guerre à Gaza sur les campus américains, a menacé mardi de renvoyer les dizaines de personnes qui occupent un bâtiment de l'établissement, totalement bouclé par la police.
La colère étudiante américaine se propage depuis deux semaines des grandes universités de la côte Est à celles de Californie en passant par le sud et le centre, rappelant les manifestations contre la guerre du Vietnam à la fin des années 1960.
Columbia et ses 37.000 étudiants est aussi au coeur du mouvement contre la guerre d'Israël contre le Hamas dans la bande de Gaza.
Mardi soir, le campus aéré et d'habitude ouvert aux passants du nord de Manhattan est entièrement bouclé, et des policiers érigent des barrières avant une possible intervention, selon une journaliste de l'AFP.
Quelques dizaines de protestataires sont barricadés depuis la nuit dernière dans un bâtiment, Hamilton Hall, que d'autres ont protégé grâce à une chaîne humaine, masques sanitaires sur le visage et keffiehs sur la tête.
Dénonçant une "escalade", le porte-parole de Columbia Ben Chang a menacé de les "renvoyer" de l'université en les accusant de "vandaliser, casser et bloquer les accès" du Hamilton Hall. Le bâtiment a été renommé "Hind's Hall" par le groupe pro-palestinien "Columbia University Apartheid Divest", en hommage à une fillette de six ans tuée à Gaza.
"Nous ne partirons pas", a proclamé ce groupe, certains militants campant aussi sur une pelouse du campus.
La présidence de Columbia avait commencé lundi à "suspendre" administrativement des étudiants qui refusaient de quitter ce "village" de tentes.
A six mois de la présidentielle dans un pays polarisé, le mouvement estudiantin inquiète la Maison Blanche, et aussi et l'ONU.
Joe Biden, président du pays allié "indéfectible" d'Israël, a critiqué les tensions ravivées à Columbia, université privée qui forme l'élite: "Occuper par la force un bâtiment universitaire est la mauvaise approche" et ne représente "pas un exemple de manifestation pacifique", a tonné John Kirby, porte-parole du Conseil de sécurité nationale de la Maison Blanche.
Aux Nations unies, le secrétaire général Antonio Guterres a jugé "essentiel en toutes circonstances de garantir les libertés d'expression et de manifestation pacifique" tout en insistant sur le fait que "les discours racistes étaient évidemment inacceptables".
Avant un duel entre l'ex-président Donald Trump et le sortant Joe Biden, qui a besoin du vote de la jeunesse, le chef républicain de la Chambre des représentants Mike Johnson a dénoncé "l'illégalité et le chaos absolus sur les campus en Amérique" et "l'antisémitisme et l'échec dans la protection d'étudiants juifs".
Il a réclamé le départ de la présidente de Columbia, Minouche Shafik.

Columbia refuse.
Mais un autre campus d'élite du nord-est, Brown University à Providence dans le Rhode Island, a annoncé un accord avec les étudiants: démantèlement du campement contre un vote de l'université en octobre sur d'éventuels "désinvestissements de +sociétés qui rendent possible et profitent du génocide à Gaza+".
L'étudiant Leo Corzo-Clark a sauté de joie pour cette "énorme victoire pour ce mouvement international et le peuple de Palestine".
A travers les Etats-Unis, les images de forces de l'ordre en tenue anti-émeute intervenant brutalement sur des campus ont fait le tour du monde.
Depuis le week-end dernier, des centaines d'étudiants, enseignants, militants d'une vingtaine d'universités ont été interpellés, certains arrêtés en placées en détention.
A l'université du Texas à Austin (sud), près de 80 personnes étaient en garde à vue mardi et seront poursuivies en justice pour "délit d'intrusion", selon le bureau du shérif local.
En Californie, la police "a fait évacuer et sécurisé" à l'aube deux bâtiments de l'université Cal Poly Humboldt et arrêté 35 personnes, afin de "rétablir l'ordre" selon cet établissement.
A l'Université de Caroline du Nord à Chapel Hill, un groupe d'étudiants a revendiqué avoir hissé un drapeau palestinien au centre du campus, avant que la police ne remette en place les couleurs des Etats-Unis, selon la presse.

Ces nouvelles manifestations pro-palestiniennes aux Etats-Unis ont ravivé le débat électrique depuis octobre entre liberté d'expression et accusations d'antisémitisme.
Le pays compte le plus grand nombre de juifs dans le monde après Israël, et des millions d'Américains arabo-musulmans.
La guerre dans la bande de Gaza a été déclenchée par l'attaque sans précédent du Hamas le 7 octobre sur le sol israélien qui a entraîné le massacre de 1.170 personnes, essentiellement des civils, selon un bilan de l'AFP à partir de données officielles israéliennes. En représailles, Israël a promis de détruire le mouvement islamiste palestinien et sa vaste opération militaire à Gaza a fait 34.535 morts, majoritairement des civils, selon le Hamas.

Article: Gaz lacrymogène et balles en caoutchouc tirés par la police contre des manifestants à Tbilissi le 30 avril 2024
La police géorgienne a fait usage de la force mardi, utilisant gaz lacrymogène et balles en caoutchouc contre des manifestants qui protestaient par milliers dans la capitale Tbilissi pour la troisième semaine consécutive contre un projet de loi controversé, a constaté un journaliste de l'AFP.
Le pays du Caucase est en proie à des manifestations antigouvernementales massives depuis le 9 avril, après que le parti au pouvoir, le Rêve géorgien, a réintroduit un projet de loi sur "l'influence étrangère" jugé contraire aux aspirations de Tbilissi à rejoindre l'Union européenne (UE).
Des policiers antiémeutes masqués sont intervenus, sans avertissement, utilisant du gaz lacrymogène et des balles en caoutchouc, frappant et arrêtant des dizaines de personnes, selon un journaliste de l'AFP sur place.
Plusieurs journalistes ont été attaqués, dont un photographe de l'AFP qui a été frappé avec une matraque en caoutchouc, alors qu'il était clairement identifié comme un professionnel des médias.
Le député Levan Khabeichvili, président du Mouvement national uni de l'ex-président emprisonné Mikheïl Saakachvili, principal parti d'opposition, a été violemment battu et a dû recevoir des soins.
Les chaînes de télévision locales ont diffusé des images montrant son visage marqué de coups.
"J'appelle le ministre de l'Intérieur à mettre immédiatement fin à la répression du rassemblement pacifique, à l'utilisation d'une force disproportionnée et à la violence contre les jeunes", a déclaré la présidente de la Géorgie, Salomé Zourabichvili, qui est opposée au parti au pouvoir.
Le Défenseur des droits géorgien, Levan Iosseliani, a demandé l'ouverture d'une enquête sur l'utilisation d'une "force disproportionnée" contre les manifestants et les journalistes.

Les protestataires rassemblés devant le Parlement ont manifesté contre le projet de loi sur "l'influence étrangère", jugé liberticide, jusqu'après minuit malgré les canons à eau et les gaz lacrymogènes.
Ils ont bloqué la circulation devant le Parlement sur l'avenue Roustaveli, principale artère de Tbilissi, ainsi que sur plusieurs autres axes importants de la ville.
"Ils ont peur parce qu'ils voient notre détermination", a affirmé mardi soir à l'AFP une manifestante de 21 ans, Natia Gabissonia, devant le Parlement.
"Nous ne les laisserons pas faire passer cette loi russe et enterrer notre avenir européen", a-t-elle ajouté.
Les députés géorgiens ont débattu mardi en deuxième lecture du projet de loi que le parti au pouvoir espère faire voter d'ici à la mi-mai.

Le projet de loi doit faire l'objet de trois lectures au Parlement et être ratifié par la présidence. La présidente géorgienne devrait opposer son veto à la mesure, selon toute attente, mais le parti au pouvoir dispose d'un nombre de sièges au Parlement suffisant pour passer outre.
Selon ses détracteurs, le projet s'inspire de la loi russe sur les "agents de l'étranger" utilisée pour étouffer les voix dissidentes.
Le président du Conseil européen Charles Michel a estimé que le projet de loi n'était pas compatible avec le souhait de la Géorgie de devenir membre de l'Union européenne.
Des manifestations ont également eu lieu dans la deuxième ville géorgienne, Batoumi, et dans celle de Koutaïssi, selon le média indépendant Formula TV.
Lundi, plusieurs milliers de personnes avaient participé à une contre-manifestation organisée devant le Parlement par le Rêve géorgien.

Le puissant milliardaire Bidzina Ivanichvili, président du parti au pouvoir considéré comme le dirigeant de facto du pays, s'est adressé lundi à la foule. Il a défendu le projet de loi visant, selon lui, à renforcer la transparence sur les financements étrangers des associations, estimant que "le financement non transparent des ONG est le principal instrument pour la nomination d'un gouvernement géorgien de l'étranger".
Au printemps 2023, le parti au pouvoir avait dû renoncer à une première tentative de faire adopter la loi, après des protestations massives.
En décembre, l'UE a accordé à l'ex-république soviétique le statut de candidat officiel à l'adhésion à l'Union, tout en le prévenant qu'il devait notamment réformer son système judiciaire et son système électoral, renforcer la liberté de la presse et limiter la puissance des oligarques, avant l'ouverture de négociations.

Faut-il forcer les entreprises à acheter des voitures électriques ? L'Assemblée nationale a à peine entamé mardi l'examen d'une proposition de loi macroniste clivante, reportée à une date ultérieure faute de temps.
Ce texte, qui divisait la majorité, pourrait être réinscrit à l'ordre du jour après les élections européennes du 9 juin. Un soulagement pour certains élus du camp présidentiel qui redoutaient la tenue de ce débat sensible avant le scrutin.
Mardi soir, seuls le rapporteur Renaissance Damien Adam et le ministre des Transports Patrice Vergriete ont pu s'exprimer. Prudent, le gouvernement a salué un "pas dans la bonne direction", tout en réclamant un "équilibre global" et "acceptable" dans ce texte.
Les 3.500 entreprises qui gèrent un parc de plus de 100 véhicules sont tenues depuis 2019 de commander des quotas de véhicules à faibles émissions quand elles renouvellent leurs flottes. Elles doivent ainsi devancer l'interdiction à la vente des véhicules thermiques neufs en 2035.
Mais cette obligation (10% de véhicules à faibles émissions en 2022) n'a été respectée que par un tiers de ces grandes entreprises, faute de sanctions, et avec des voitures électriques encore chères à l'achat.
Le député Renaissance Damien Adam s'exprime lors d'une séance de questions au gouvernement à l'Assemblée nationale, à Paris, le 27 juin 2023
La proposition de loi du député Damien Adam (Renaissance) voudrait "accélérer et contrôler le verdissement" de ces flottes, essentielles parce qu'elles irriguent ensuite le marché de l'occasion. Il faut selon lui "arrêter le +stop and go+" sur l'électrification des véhicules et "offrir une trajectoire sanctuarisée".
Son texte a provoqué une levée de boucliers de la part de plusieurs professions, comme les loueurs de courte durée. Ils estiment qu'ils ne peuvent pas s'électrifier aussi vite que les particuliers et que ce saut électrique mettrait leur trésorerie en danger.
Lors de son passage en commission, il a déjà été légèrement assoupli. La trajectoire de verdissement a notamment été décalée d'un an (20% de véhicules à très faibles émissions en 2025 plutôt qu'en 2024, puis 30% en 2026, jusqu'à 90% en 2032), et les sanctions atténuées: de 5.000 à 2.000 euros par véhicule manquant en 2025, avant d'augmenter.
Les entreprises de location de courte durée ont également eu droit à une trajectoire plus souple, tandis que les plateformes de VTC et de taxis doivent être traitées dans un décret à part.
L'enjeu de ce texte est désormais plus de "faire appliquer la loi telle qu'elle est" que d'avancer davantage sur l'électrification, a commenté Léo Larivière, de Transport & Environment. L'ONG, alliée à la CFDT, au Réseau Action Climat ou encore à l'UFC-Que choisir, a exhorté fin avril le Premier ministre à soutenir cette réforme.
"Si la loi venait à ne pas être votée ou si son ambition venait à être trop réduite, nous risquerions de condamner les objectifs nationaux et européens de décarbonation du secteur des transports", ont prévenu les organisations dans une lettre ouverte.
"Si la loi venait à ne pas être votée ou si son ambition venait à être trop réduite, nous risquerions de condamner les objectifs nationaux et européens de décarbonation du secteur des transports", ont prévenu les organisations
En commission, la proposition de loi a été soutenue par Renaissance et par la gauche, et combattue par LR et le RN, qui dénonce de "l'écologie punitive".
La majorité est quant à elle divisée, à l'image de l'opposition du MoDem Bruno Millienne: "je me refuse à légiférer au doigt mouillé", lance le député centriste. "La trajectoire n'est pas respectée, ça ne marche pas, et on dit que ce qu'on va faire, c'est durcir la trajectoire".
Chez Horizons, autre allié du camp présidentiel, Vincent Thiébaut est "très mitigé" et souligne le manque de bornes de recharge. "Il faut prendre un peu de recul", avec une "mission parlementaire", suggère-t-il, en doutant de "la volonté du Sénat" de reprendre un tel texte.
"Si des gens de la majorité ont envie de dire qu'ils sont contre l'électrification des voitures, bon courage", réagit une source au sein du groupe Renaissance.
Parmi les amendements qui devaient être examinés, certains demandent d'aller plus loin dans l'assouplissement de la loi ou d'intégrer d'autres technologies plus polluantes que l'électrique, comme les hybrides rechargeables ou les agrocarburants.
D'autres, du côté de Renaissance et de la gauche, voulaient pousser au verdissement des flottes publiques pour des raisons d'exemplarité.

Article: Pentes, risques d’éboulement... Dans ces vignobles de l’extrême, comment les vignerons s’adaptent-ils ?
Sur certaines appellations, les vignes cultivées sur des pentes fortement inclinées créent des paysages abrupts, sculptés par l'homme. Sur ces parcelles impossibles à mécaniser, la somme de travail est décuplée et les rendements sont limités.
Collioure et Banyuls, une culture de l'extrême
Sur la Côte Vermeille, dans les Pyrénées Orientales, les vignes des appellations Banyuls, Banyuls Grand Cru et Collioure s'étagent sur un vignoble de 1200 hectares qui commence au niveau de la mer et qui culmine à près de 400 mètres d'altitude. «Un tiers de notre vignoble est installé sur des pentes dépassant les 50%. C'est ce qui explique la présence de murets pour stopper l'érosion selon une technique ancestrale et canaliser l'eau, et celle de rigoles qui permettent de capter le ruissellement des eaux lors d'épisodes de fortes précipitations», explique Igor Akhiridinov, le directeur de l'AOP Collioure-Banyuls. Sur le territoire du cru, rien n'est mécanisable, à l'exception de quelques parcelles où peuvent se faufiler un treuil et un cheval. «Ce travail à la main qui peut être très ardu, et qui exige beaucoup de main-d’œuvre, a un impact énorme sur le coût de production des vins», souligne Igor Akhiridinov. Sur ces terres de schistes, particulièrement friables, le grenache est roi. La multitude de parcelles, également appelées «feixas», qui composent l'architecture viticole, permet aux vignerons d'élaborer des cuvées parcellaires aux influences singulières. «À l'origine, ce terroir était exclusivement dédié à la production de vins doux naturels, puissants et oxydatifs. La reconnaissance des vins secs nous permet de composer, grâce à nos différentes altitudes, des profils plus frais», termine-t-il.
Dans le vignoble de Côte-Rôtie, des pentes à 60%
Sur les coteaux de la rive droite du Rhône, le vignoble de Côte-Rôtie se déploie sur les communes d'Ampuis, de Saint-Cyr-sur-Rhône et Tupins-Semons. Très pentu (jusqu'à 60% par endroits), le vignoble compte 340 hectares de vignes. «Sur ce territoire vallonné, les ruisseaux et les combes boisées alternent entre chaque coteau, ce qui amène de la fraîcheur et de la biodiversité», présente Michaël Gerin, président du syndicat des vignerons de l'AOC Côte-Rôtie et vigneron au Domaine Jean-Michel Gérin. «En ce qui me concerne, sur mes 20 hectares de vignes, 13 hectares sont en coteaux avec des inclinaisons impressionnantes comme sur les parcelles de La Landonne et de la Viallière. D'ailleurs, on me demande souvent si on doit s'attacher pour aller dans nos vignes. La contrainte, c'est la non-mécanisation. Nous sommes une équipe de 20 personnes à piocher, arracher l'herbe à la main, à faire du treuil. Chaque vigne a une méthode de culture et l'inclinaison nous oblige à nous adapter», explique Michaël Gerin. Étape cruciale, l'attachage de la vigne mobilise une grande main-d'œuvre. «La syrah , il faut vraiment l'attacher sur des échalas avec du jonc, de la paille, de la ficelle car elle est très cassante quand il y a du vent, et c'est une étape qui prend du temps», précise le vigneron. Les vendanges nécessitent également une logistique à toute épreuve : «On est 40, pour 20 hectares, pendant 12 jours. Certains vont couper, d'autres sortir la vendange, vider chaque seau en faisant des chaînes jusqu'à un véhicule. Chaque raisin doit arriver en cave dans un état sanitaire parfait et cela demande une logistique très énergivore», termine Michaël. Gerin.
À Saint-Joseph, le risque d’éboulement
Entre Valence et Lyon, l'appellation Saint-Joseph – cru de la vallée du Rhône septentrionale - produit 50 000 HL de vin par an. Sur les zones escarpées de ce vignoble de reliefs, les murets en pierre sèche, appelés «chaillés», jouent un rôle clé pour rendre les parcelles cultivables. «Ils témoignent de notre façon de nous adapter au territoire pour cultiver sur des sols en pente. Ils exigent un entretien permanent car la pierre s'érode avec le temps et les automnes pluvieux créent des éboulements», explique Joël Durand, le président de l'appellation. Sur ces zones pentues où le travail est manuel, les chemins d'accès aux parcelles font l'objet d'une attention particulière. «Si, dans les vignes, beaucoup de choses sont faites à la main, on recherche le maximum d'accès aux parcelles par des moyens mécaniques : des chemins pour transporter la vendange ou les amendements organiques. Travailler dans les coteaux, c'est super. On n'est pas dans une immensité artificielle, on voit les vallées. Mais, il faut aussi admettre qu'on travaille dans des vignobles exposés à des sécheresses ou des précipitations excessives, qui détruisent une infrastructure non modernisable. On est condamnés à être des vignobles humains d'où l'automatisation est absente», termine Joël Durand.

Article: Pourquoi la production de vin a baissé drastiquement en 2023
Dans son dernier rapport, l'OIV dévoile une baisse notable de 10% des productions viticoles mondiale en 2023, un résultat qui relance les interrogations sur l'impact du dérèglement climatique et de l'inflation.
Lors de sa conférence de presse annuelle sur l'état du secteur vitivinicole à travers le monde, l'OIV (Organisation Internationale de la Vigne et du Vin) a révélé les rapports d'une année 2023 peu favorable pour le vin. Sa production en baisse montre la souffrance traversée par les cultures face au dérèglement climatiques et aux phénomènes météorologiques parfois dramatiques pour les viticulteurs. On note également parmi les raisons de cette baisse l'augmentation du prix du vin au litre. Sa consommation et ses exportations subissent également une baisse conséquente.
Une surface réduite
En 2023, les terres viticoles européennes ont subi une légère baisse de 0,8%, soit 3,3 millions d'hectares. L'expansion modeste observée en Italie, en Allemagne et en Grèce n'a pas compensé le niveau de disparition des vignobles observé dans d'autres pays de l'UE. Pour les deux plus gros territoires viticoles, la surface de production est elle aussi réduite, de 1% pour l'Espagne, soit 945 000 ha, et de 0,4% en France, dont le vignoble s'établit à 792 000 ha. Malgré une longue période d'expansion de ses cultures viticoles, la surface des terres chinoises connaît un déclin progressif de 0,3% en 2022. Cependant, ses avantages géographiques la placent en troisième position dans le classement des plus grandes surfaces viticoles mondiales.
Une production nettement amputée
La production mondiale de vin pour l'année 2023 a connu une chute significative, enregistrant une baisse de près de 25 millions d'hectolitres (-9,6%) par rapport à l'année précédente. Cette diminution importante marque l'une des baisses les plus marquées observées dans l'histoire récente de la viticulture. Le volume de l'année 2023 atteint son niveau le plus bas depuis 1961, avec seulement 214 millions d'hectolitres. Cette baisse drastique peut être attribuée à une série d'événements climatiques adverses, notamment les gelées printanières, des précipitations abondantes et des sécheresses prolongées, aggravées par la propagation généralisée de maladies.
En 2023, la France, leader mondial de la production vinicole, a récolté 48 millions d'hectolitres, soit 20% de la production mondiale. Cette performance dépasse de 4,4% celle de l'année précédente et surpasse la moyenne nationale de 8,3%. L'Italie a connu une chute historique de sa production, atteignant seulement 38,3 millions d'hectolitres, soit une baisse de 23,2%. L'Espagne a également enregistré sa plus faible récolte depuis 1995, avec 28,3 millions d'hectolitres, en baisse de 20,8% par rapport à 2022, principalement à cause d'une sécheresse prolongée et d'extrêmes températures.
Une consommation régie par l'inflation
Selon John Baker, directeur général de l'OIV, la consommation mondiale de vin est en déclin depuis plusieurs années, notamment depuis 2018. L'inflation est identifiée comme l'un des facteurs contribuant à cette diminution de la consommation. En tête du marché mondial se trouvent les États-Unis avec une part de marché de 15%, suivis de la France avec 11%, de l'Italie avec 10%, de l'Allemagne avec 9% et de la Russie avec 6%. Malgré son importance économique croissante, la Chine perd en moyenne 2 millions d'hectolitres de consommation de vin par an. Ce marché émergent peine encore à s'établir de manière stable sur le marché mondial du vin. Cependant, la Chine reste nettement moins consommatrice de vin que d'autres pays champions toutes catégories, tels que la France ou le Portugal.

Article: «C’est la catastrophe» : à Cahors, un vignoble et une appellation en état de choc après l'épisode de gel
L’épisode de gel a particulièrement touché le vignoble de Cahors. Déjà victimes d’un millésime 2023 compliqué, les vignerons s’attendent désormais à perdre une bonne partie de leur récolte en 2024.
La quasi-totalité du vignoble de Cahors a été décimée la semaine dernière par un épisode de gel tardif, dans un terroir déjà touché en 2023 par le mildiou, a-t-on appris auprès de l'interprofession. «On a eu trois jours de gel d'affilée, la température est descendue jusqu'à -4°C. Sur 90% du vignoble, on a 100% de dégâts. Sur les 10% restants, on verra d'ici un mois», a déploré le président de l'AOC, Nicolas Fournié. «Les feuilles, les bourgeons, les sarments sont devenues marron, ça a séché, comme brûlé. La vigne est en état de choc», a-t-il décrit à l'AFP.
Les vignerons du Lot s'attendaient à des températures négatives, mais pas aussi basses. Environ 250 vignerons indépendants ou coopératives sont affectés par le phénomène climatique. Quelques semaines après un épisode de gel, le pied de vigne donne à nouveau des feuilles, mais avec beaucoup moins de raisin au moment des vendanges. «Cela fait beaucoup d'aléas climatiques en peu de temps», a regretté le président de l'AOC Cahors. «On espérait beaucoup de 2024, car l'an dernier, le rendement de l'appellation a été faible (avec seulement 40% de la capacité de production). Ça commence à jouer sérieusement sur les finances et le moral.»
À Cahors, pas de mesures anti-gel par manque de moyens
Germain Croisille, l’une des figures de la jeune génération à Cahors, pointe du doigt la fragilité de Cahors, situé à un carrefour entre différentes influences : océaniques, continentales et méditerranéennes. «Cette situation géographique implique de grandes variations climatiques. Et c'est précisément cela qui nous impacte en tant que vignerons», a-t-il expliqué au Figaro. Hiver doux («Il nous est arrivé de tailler en t-shirt !»), printemps pluvieux et gélif, puis été caniculaire... Autant d’ingrédients pour un cocktail explosif qui fait redouter la multiplication de ces épisodes. «C'est la catastrophe, juge Germain Croisille. D'autant que cet épisode fait suite à la plus petite récolte enregistrée depuis la création de l'appellation (en 1971, NDLR). En 2023, c'était la pluie, le mildiou et la sécheresse en été. Et de nouveau, 2024 s’annonce comme un millésime très faible. Ça s'enchaîne, avec des domaines déjà fragiles avec des trésoreries critiques». «C'est très inquiétant pour l'avenir de l'appellation», termine le vigneron.
Si les producteurs de vin de Cahors ne sont pas en mesure de fournir les volumes prévus, ils redoutent de perdre des marchés. Tout cela alors que pour beaucoup d’entre eux, les finances sont déjà dans le rouge. La plupart n’ont d’ailleurs pas été en mesure de déployer des mesures anti-gel, comme des bougies de paraffine, des systèmes d’aspersion ou des éoliennes. Non loin du Lot, les vignobles de Fronton (Haute-Garonne) et de Gaillac (Tarn) ont été affectés par le même épisode de gel, mais dans une moindre mesure.

Article: Découvrez l’interview de Château Olivier pour la minute Pessac-Léognan
Rendez-vous avec Eléonore de Bethmann, Présidente du Directoire de Château Olivier, afin d'en découvrir tous les secrets.
Le château Olivier attise la curiosité. D'abord grâce à ce qui saute aux yeux, son apparence pittoresque. L'un des seuls châteaux bordelais à posséder une douve et un pont-levis. Ses vignes, elles aussi protégées par la forêt composée de chênes centenaires, de boisements feuillus, de pinèdes, de bosquets et de prairies. L'histoire du château est riche, entre le Prince Noir d'Angleterre Edward de Woodstock au XIVème siècle et la prise en main de la propriété par la famille de Bethmann au XIXème. Cette famille historique de la région est toujours à la tête du domaine puisque c'est désormais Eléonore de Bethmann qui est à la gouvernance de Château Olivier.
Le vignoble de Château Olivier couvre 60 ha – dont 52 en rouge et 8 en blanc. Les vignes occupent un terroir de graves sur un socle argilo-calcaire qui permet la production de vins rouges et de vins blancs de grande qualité. Historique de l'appellation Pessac-Léognan, Château Olivier fut l'une des premières propriétés à avoir fait cartographier son terroir, permettant par la suite une évolution positive de la qualité de ses vins.

La technologie 6MotionMC utilise jusqu’à six mouvements de lavage différents pour offrir une expérience de nettoyage intelligente qui lave les vêtements en douceur tout en maximisant les performances de nettoyage.
Le froid, c’est efficace
Désormais, vous pouvez sélectionner le cycle de lavage à l’eau froide sur votre laveuse sans compromettre la propreté de vos vêtements. La technologie ColdWashMC utilise l’eau froide et des mouvements de lavage améliorés afin de pénétrer les tissus en profondeur. Ainsi, vous profitez des économies d’un lavage à l’eau froide et des bienfaits d’un lavage à l’eau chaude.
Gagnez du temps et simplifiez votre journée de lavage
Repoussez les limites de votre salle de lavage grâce à l’application ThinQMD. Démarrez votre laveuse ou votre sécheuse à distance, sélectionnez un cycle, surveillez la consommation d’énergie, démarrez ou arrêtez le lavage et recevez des notifications lorsque le cycle est terminé, le tout à partir de votre téléphone intelligent. Vos appareils sont compatibles avec l’Assistant Google et Alexa d’Amazon pour que vous puissiez gérer votre lavage à l’aide de simples commandes vocales.
Un gain de temps appréciable
Super grande capacité, super grandes brassées.
Un séchage précis
Le système de séchage par détecteur de LG mesure les niveaux d'humidité durant le cycle et règle automatiquement le temps de séchage afin que votre lessive soit sèche à tous les coups.

Article: Sécheuse de 6,3 pi3 à hyper grande capacité dotée de la porte EasyUnloadMC
EasyUnloadMC – pour une expérience de lavage plus pratique
La clé de notre conception EasyUnloadMC se cache sous l’élégant panneau de verre. Nous avons incliné le devant de la laveuse pour un accès plus confortable et ergonomique. Vous pouvez maintenant récupérer facilement les articles restés au fond de la cuve, sans compromettre la capacité de celle-ci. Jumelez-la à une sécheuse de LG dotée de deux options d’ouverture de la porte EasyLoadMC et transférez aisément les vêtements de la laveuse à la sécheuse, et de la sécheuse au panier.
L’intelligence intégrée élimine la part de hasard.
Plus besoin de passer des heures à trouver le bon cycle. Les capteurs intégrés utilisent la technologie d’IA pour détecter la texture du tissu et la taille de la brassée, puis sélectionnent automatiquement les mouvements de lavage, les températures et bien plus encore pour un entretien avancé du tissu. Grâce à la fonctionnalité Smart PairingMC, la laveuse peut même demander à la sécheuse de sélectionner un cycle de séchage compatible*, ce qui en fait le compagnon de lavage par excellence.
ThinQMD
Vous pensez que vous ne pouvez pas faire la lessive pendant vos déplacements? Vous vous trompez. Repoussez les limites de votre salle de lavage grâce à l’application ThinQMD. Démarrez votre sécheuse à distance, sélectionnez un cycle, surveillez la consommation d’énergie, recevez des conseils d’entretien, démarrez ou arrêtez le cycle et recevez des notifications à la fin du cycle, le tout sur votre téléphone intelligent.

EasyUnloadMC – pour une expérience de lavage plus pratique
La clé de notre conception EasyUnloadMC se cache sous l’élégant panneau de verre. Nous avons incliné le devant de la laveuse pour un accès plus confortable et ergonomique. Vous pouvez maintenant récupérer facilement les articles restés au fond de la cuve, sans compromettre la capacité de celle-ci. Jumelez-la à une sécheuse de LG dotée de deux options d’ouverture de la porte EasyLoad(MC) et transférez aisément les vêtements de la laveuse à la sécheuse, et de la sécheuse au panier.
ezDispense(MC) – Lavez jusqu’à 25 brassées en un seul remplissage facile*
Distribue automatiquement la bonne quantité de détergent et d’assouplissant en évitant les remplissages, pour un maximum de 14 à 25 brassées*. Vous recevez même des notifications sur votre téléphone intelligent lorsqu’il est temps de remplir le réservoir, ce qui rend la lessive rapide, facile et infaillible**.
L’intelligence intégrée élimine la part de hasard.
Plus besoin de passer des heures à trouver le bon cycle. Les capteurs intégrés utilisent la technologie d’IA pour détecter la texture du tissu et la taille de la brassée, puis sélectionnent automatiquement les mouvements de lavage, les températures et bien plus encore pour un entretien avancé du tissu. Grâce à la fonctionnalité Smart PairingMC, la laveuse peut même demander à la sécheuse de sélectionner un cycle de séchage compatible*, ce qui en fait le compagnon de lavage par excellence.
Commandes numériques avec affichage ACL
L’intelligence intégrée de LG et le cadran ACL intuitif facilitent l’organisation de la journée de lavage. Les commandes simplifiées vous donnent plus de ce dont vous avez besoin à chaque tour de cadran, des messages utiles aux mises à jour d’état en passant par la durée restante du cycle. Accédez facilement à plus de 20 cycles et modifiez rapidement n’importe quel cycle à l’aide de l’écran tactile pour un contrôle total de la lessive.

Article: 90' Enquêtes - Go fast, braqueurs et forcenés : au coeur des opérations secrètes du GIGN
C'est un document exceptionnel proposé par 90’ENQUETES, consacré à l'unité d'élite la plus connue en France : le GIGN, groupe d'intervention de la gendarmerie nationale. Pour neutraliser un terroriste, interpeller un caïd du grand banditisme ou un forcené retranché, ce sont eux qu'on envoie en première ligne. Un groupe de choc devenu célèbre en 1994, après la libération spectaculaire des otages de l'Airbus d'Air France sur l'aéroport de Marignane. Pour la première fois, nos caméras ont été autorisées à suivre la Force Intervention, l'unité d'assaut la plus confidentielle du GIGN. Une centaine d'hommes cagoulés, surarmés et surentrainés, dépêchés sur les missions les plus risquées et les plus confidentielles. Au cours de cette immersion exceptionnelle au cœur d'opérations rarement filmées, vous allez donc découvrir les hommes du GIGN comme vous ne les avez jamais vus ! De leurs repérages discrets sur le terrain, aux interpellations souvent musclées, en passant par leurs moments de vie, nous avons partagé toutes leurs missions… de l'intérieur.

Article: Université: un accord avec les étudiants pro-palestiniens
(Keystone-ATS) L’université américaine Brown, un prestigieux campus du nord-est des Etats-Unis, a annoncé jeudi un accord avec ses étudiants pro-palestiniens, premier du genre dans la crise qui secoue le monde estudiantin américain à propos de la guerre dans la bande de Gaza.
La présidente de Brown University à Providence (Rhode Island), Christina Paxson, s’est réjouie dans un communiqué du démantèlement d’un “campement” d’étudiants et de militants pro-palestiniens à 17H00 (23H00 Heure suisse) en échange de la promesse que le conseil d’administration de l’université se prononcera sur d’éventuels “désinvestissements de sociétés qui rendent possible et profitent du génocide à Gaza”.
Couper les liens entre les grandes universités privées américaines et des mécènes et entreprises liés à Israël fait partie des revendications du mouvement étudiant et militant qui défend la cause palestinienne et est vent debout contre la guerre que mène l’Etat hébreu contre le Hamas dans la bande de Gaza.
L’accord à Brown est la première concession accordée par une université d’élite au mouvement national qui s’est propagé depuis deux semaines à travers tous les Etats-Unis, de la Californie à l’ouest (Universités Ucla, USC…) aux Etats du nord-est (Columbia, Yale, Harvard, UPenn) en passant par les Etats du centre et du sud comme le Texas et l’Arizona. Les étudiants et la direction de Brown doivent encore discuter de mai à octobre des contours de l’accord.
Dans le campement, des manifestants ont sauté de joie et se sont serrés dans les bras en chantant selon une journaliste de l’AFPTV.
Les manifestations sur les campus américains ont ravivé aux Etats-Unis le débat tendu depuis le début de la guerre dans la bande de Gaza entre liberté d’expression, droit constitutionnel et accusations d’antisémitisme et d’antisionisme.
La présidente de Brown a reconnu que “les destructions et pertes en vie humaine au Proche-Orient ont poussé beaucoup (d’étudiants) à un appel à des changements significatifs”.
La dirigeante universitaire, dont deux homologues à Harvard et UPenn avaient dû démissionner cet hiver pour des propos jugés ambigus devant le Congrès des Etats-Unis sur la lutte contre l’antisémitisme, a dénoncé aussi “l’escalade d’une rhétorique incendiaire (…) et la hausse des tensions sur les campus du pays”.

Article: Chez BNP Paribas, les bonus des collaborateurs les mieux payés n’ont baissé que de 10 %
Pour chacun de ses 877 collaborateurs les mieux payés en banque de financement et d’investissement, BNP Paribas a déboursé un total de 1,1 million d’euros l’an dernier, en légère baisse par rapport au 1,2 million de l’année précédente.
BNP a publié ses chiffres pour 2023 dans son Rapport sur les Rémunérations paru début avril. La banque de la rue d’Antin a dépensé au total 541 millions d’euros en bonus pour les preneurs de risque de sa banque de financement et d’investissement en 2023, soit une progression par rapport aux 504 millions d’euros de 2022.
Toutefois, le nombre de preneurs de risque de la banque a augmenté de 19 % sur la même période, de sorte que les bonus par tête ont régressé de 10 %, pour une moyenne de 617k euros par personne.
BNP Paribas définit comme suit les preneurs de risque (ou MRT, correspondant aux « Material Risk Takers » des anglo-saxons) : les personnes ayant autorité pour initier des transactions excédant 5% de la limite de VaR du groupe ; les personnes ayant autorité pour approuver ou refuser directement ce type de transactions ; les managers dont les employés ont autorité pour approuver ces transactions : les 0,3% supérieurs des plus hautes rémunérations de la banque ; toute personne gagnant plus de 750k € ; et les personnes gagnant plus que le seuil le plus élevé entre 500k € et la rémunération totale moyenne des membres de l’organe de direction et de la Direction générale du Groupe pour l’exercice précédent.
Même si la rémunération totale moyenne des MRT a reculé l’an dernier, elle est restée supérieure à celle des années d’avant la pandémie. Voilà pourquoi une baisse de 10 % semble plutôt correcte : dans l’ensemble, on s’attendait chez BNP à des bonus plutôt médiocres au vu de la chute de 13 % sur un an des revenus de l’activité trading fixed income au quatrième trimestre.
Au total, sur l’ensemble des activités de BNP Paribas, 376 personnes ont gagné plus d’un million d’euros en 2023, contre 368 en 2022. Cela dit, le nombre de collaborateurs ayant perçu plus de 3 millions d’euros est passé de 29 à 24 sur la même période.
BNP Paribas ne détaille pas la répartition de son enveloppe de bonus au sein de la banque d’investissement ; nous n’avons donc pas d’information sur la rémunération des salariés en deçà du niveau MRT.
Bloomberg indiquait en mars que BNP Paribas avait réduit de 5 % les bonus en banque de financement et d’investissement au titre de l’année écoulée. Toutefois, notre propre enquête sur les rémunérations, menée en début d’année, laissait supposer que les bonus avaient en fait baissé de 10 % pour la banque dans son ensemble. La plupart des salariés gagnent en réalité beaucoup moins que les preneurs de risque : le bonus moyen ressorti de notre enquête était de 129k $ (120k €) pour BNP Paribas, et la rémunération totale moyenne de nos répondants en poste chez BNP de 326k $ (305k €).

Article: Dal 30 aprile 2024 è disponibile su tutte le piattaforme di streaming digitale e in formato fisico “GINKGO BILOBA” (Overdub Recordings), il nuovo album del gruppo AMORE PSICHE.
“Ginkgo Biloba”, il secondo album di Amore Psiche, prodotto da Francesco Campanozzi, si snoda tra chitarre folk, ritmi sincopati e sonorità elettroniche che creano ambienti sotterranei. In questi spazi, la voce ricama parole feline e cariche di desiderio. Il disco pone una questione fondamentale: cosa resta se i nostri bisogni materialistici si ridimensionano e le nostre certezze svaniscono? Il mondo potrebbe trasformarsi, diventare diverso da come lo conosciamo; potremmo dedicarci molto di più alle carezze, prenderci cura del patrimonio artistico e vivere in sintonia con la natura, adottando un approccio meno antropocentrico e considerando gli esseri umani come una parte del pianeta Terra, dove tutte le specie co-evolvono insieme. Il Ginkgo Biloba ci insegna che è possibile sopravvivere a molte intemperie. Questa pianta antichissima, di 250 milioni di anni, ha superato grandi catastrofi grazie alla sua elevata resistenza alla siccità, al freddo e all’inquinamento; per questo l’album si intitola con il suo nome.
Commenta la band sul nuovo disco: “Vogliamo evolvere insieme a tutte le altre forme di vita per un futuro luminoso”.
TRACKLIST:
1 – Zoom carezze
2 – Empatia
3 – Lasciarti dire
4 – Umano troppo umano
5 – Mi prendo cura di te, Madre
6 – Le linee scompaiono
7 – È meraviglioso
8 – Ineffabile

Alcune abitudini sono più importanti di altre per il semplice fatto che sono capaci di cambiarti la vita. Vengono definite “keystone habits”, pietre di volta. Sono quelle fondamentali: una volta sviluppate, favoriscono un effetto a cascata con risultati estremamente positivi sul modo in cui affrontiamo le piccole e grandi sfide, oltre che prima di tutto sul benessere personale. E perché allora non approfittare del tempo libero delle vacanze? Questi sono alcuni consigli che ti miglioreranno la vita.
Trova un terzo posto oltre la casa e il lavoro
L’imperativo è rompere con il tran tran della vita quotidiana. Come? Cercando un terzo posto oltre la casa e il lavoro. Potrebbe essere un bar, una palestra, un parco o una biblioteca, a cui affezionarsi, possibilmente, e dove poter fare nuove amicizie.
Scomponi i problemi complessi in sistemi più semplici
Come la natura insegna la complessità e i sistemi complessi derivano dalla moltiplicazione di strutture di base estremamente semplici. Pensiamo alle lettere dell’alfabeto che compongono una lingua o al Dna, per finire al ripetersi delle geometrie in natura, le sequenze di Fibonacci e la circonferenza aurea che permettono di creare strutture solide e complesse. Non ultimo come un mattone o un mattoncino Lego possano creare nella ripetizione all’infinito delle forme complesse. Questo è valido anche nei sistemi di gioco più complessi basati sull’incremento esponenziale delle probabilità (per sapere di più. I sistemi spiegati in modo semplice).
Diffondi l’amore
Ogni tanto, scegli di fare qualcosa di carino per qualcuno a cui tieni per rendere le tue amicizie più divertenti e appaganti.
Costruisci e appendi nella tua stanza una “vision board”
Ovvero individua una parete su cui scrivere desideri, sogni, citazioni e frasi ispiranti, da visualizzare al mattino appena sveglio.
Celebra le tue vittorie
Ricordati di celebrare i traguardi raggiunti e le piccole vittorie di tutti i giorni perché, spesso, quando sei depresso, ti convinci di non combinare nulla di buono.
Fai sport di mattina
Svegliati un’ora prima e fai un po’ di sport prima di cominciare la giornata, anche solo una camminata veloce.
Fai una lista di cose che ti rendono felice
Tieni una lista di piccole cose che ti hanno reso felice negli appunti del tuo telefono in modo da leggerla ogni volta che ti sentirai triste: commenti, stralci di conversazioni, immagini, esperienze.
Di tanto in tanto stacca dai social media
Semplicemente disconnettiti da tutti i tuoi profili social e, se puoi, vivi un giorno immerso nella natura.
Stila una to-do list
Ricorri ad una tradizionale e sempre utile lista delle cose da fare su base giornaliera, settimanale e/o mensile. Se sei un tipo particolarmente tecnologico, puoi farti aiutare da programmi divertenti come Canva.
Concediti del tempo all’aria aperta
Percorri un tratto di strada a piedi per andare e venire dal lavoro, fai una passeggiata in un parco o sorseggia un caffè al sole. Bastano pochi minuti per respirare aria nuova e svolgere le attività della giornata con un nuovo slancio.
Ama te stesso
Prendi un pennarello e scrivi sullo specchio della tua camera o in bagno degli apprezzamenti nei tuoi confronti. In breve, ama te stesso e il bello (vedi anche Hygge).
E voi? Quali sono le nuove o vecchie piccole abitudini che migliorano in meglio la vostra vita?

Gazzettino d'argento, ecco la consegna dei premi. Gazzetta Lucchese ha fissato per venerdì prossimo 3 maggio la premiazione annuale del Gazzettino d'Argento, il trofeo di rendimento dei giocatori rossoneri sulla base dei voti ricevuti in campionato da tutte le testate giornalistiche.
E che da quest'anno è intitolato alla memoria del collega Diego Checchi, scomparso nel settembre scorso.
Il Gazzettino d'argento – il premio organizzato dal quotidiano on line organizzato in collaborazione con Renat e Mav Autotrasporti, e basato sui voti attribuiti dai giornali (Il Tirreno, La Nazione, Gazzetta Lucchese, Corriere dello Sport Stadio, Gazzetta dello Sport e Tuttosport) – è giunto alla sua diciassettesima edizione. A vincere l'edizione 2023-2024, è stato Andrea Rizzo Pinna con un voto medio stagionale pari a 6,24. L'esterno ha di fatto dominato la competizione – che vede premiati chi ha disputato almeno 20 gare durante l'annata regolare – rimanendo al vertice per quasi tutto il campionato. Al secondo posto, si è classificato Robert Gucher che ha chiuso con una media di 6,11; al terzo posto Niccolò Chiorra a 6,10. Nell'edizione 2022-2023 aveva vinto Andrea Tiritiello.
Accanto ai tre, un riconoscimento anche a Ettore Quirini, a lui va la prima edizione del premio "Cuore Rossonero Beppe Lorenzini", istituito, grazie alla collaborazione di Lucca United, per ricordare il grande tifoso rossonero venuto a mancare poco tempo fa. Il premio è destinato al giocatore che, al di là dei voti riportati, ha mostrato maggior attaccamento alla maglia. La consegna dei premi avverrà nella sua sede abituale, ovvero al Caffé Santa Zita di Michele Tambellini, nella splendida piazza San Frediano, a partire dalle ore 18,30.
Stasera ultimo appuntamento con Corner Corto sul profilo Facebook del nostro quotidiano online della stagione 2023-2024: sarà l'occasione per riparlare di un'annata davvero deludente, ma anche delle prospettive per il prossimo campionato, tutte ancora da capire. Appuntamento alle 19.05
In un Museo rossonero gremito, venerdì 26 aprile si è tenuto l'incontro voluto dall'amministrazione comunale con i tifosi della Lucchese per spiegare le motivazioni che hanno portato allo stop del project financing del nuovo Porta Elisa.
Il primo premio del Gazzettino d'argento, sarà intitolato alla memoria del nostro collega Diego Checchi, e un premio speciale sarà assegnato anche in ricordo di un altro grande tifoso rossonero, ovvero Beppe Lorenzini
Torna alla 19.05 l'appuntamento settimanale sul profilo Facebook del nostro quotidiano online: sarà l'occasione per riparlare della fine delle ambizioni rossonere in una stagione davvero deludente, ma anche della frenata sul progetto del nuovo Porta Elisa direttamente con l'assessore allo Sport Fabio Barsanti che interverrà in diretta nel corso della trasmissione.

Chiusa la stagione agonistica è tempo di tracciare il bilancio dell'annata rossonera e, necessariamente, il giudizio non può che essere largamente fallimentare. Non si tratta propriamente di esprimere una opinione ma di confrontare i risultati sportivi con gli obiettivi dichiarati a inizio stagione e le aspettative create nella tifoseria: la Lucchese avrebbe dovuto piazzarsi fra le prime cinque-sei squadre del girone, agganciare i playoff e la rosa avrebbe dovuto rappresentare le fondamenta di una squadra che, opportunamente integrata e rinforzata, avrebbe potuto lottare per il vertice già nel prossimo campionato.
Come sappiamo i rossoneri non solo non hanno saputo imporsi nelle posizioni attese, ma hanno anche fallito l'aggancio ai playoff, ovvero un piazzamento alla portata di ben dieci squadre nei gironi dell'attuale Serie C. Il tutto a fronte di un investimento che vede la compagine allestita dal presidente Bulgarella sostenere un monte ingaggi pari a oltre due milioni e mezzo fra stipendi e premi, l'ottavo del girone e quindi teoricamente compatibile con le ambizioni iniziali; va detto che questo parametro puramente numerico non è esaustivo rispetto ai valori delle squadre, tant'è che Spal e Entella, rispettivamente prima e terza in quanto a costo della rosa, hanno ottenuto sul campo risultati modesti come quelli della Pantera. Tuttavia, compagini come la Carrarese, dimostratasi nettamente superiore alla Lucchese a parità di ingaggi, e la Torres, costata le metà e addirittura capace di lottare per la vittoria finale, dimostrano l'importanza di dotarsi di comparti dirigenziali avvezzi alla categoria per assegnare al meglio le risorse disponibili. Ad esempio, l'Arezzo di Giovannini, neopromossa, ha fatto molto meglio della Libertas spendendo la metà, il Renate di Obbedio si è salvato nel girone A ottenendo 45 punti come la Lucchese e investendo un terzo delle risorse.
Il lungo inciso sul costo della rosa ci è sembrato necessario soprattutto in vista del commento al terzo motivo per cui la stagione rossonera può essere considerata fallimentare, cioè l'ambizione di gettare le basi per una squadra vincente. Ammettendo anche che i risultati sul campo possano essere stati frutto anche di elementi avversi quali infortuni e sfortuna, non lo pensiamo ma le variabili sportive sono molte e non tutte oggettivamente valutabili, è davvero difficile pensare che l'attuale organico, seppur con qualche ritocco, possa diventare competitivo. La realtà, piuttosto, suggerisce che quasi tutti i nuovi acquisti non siano funzionali a una squadra che vuol vincere il campionato. Nel dettaglio, Gucher sicuramente si è dimostrato un fuoriclasse ma non ha certo mostrato la tenuta atletica e la condizione dei giorni migliori; Cangianello è in prestito e difficilmente rimarrà a Lucca, Guadagni e Russo nel corso della stagione sono diventati riserve, così come Magnaghi, Fazzi e Djibril, quest'ultimo ben presto sparito dai radar; discorso a parte forse può esser fatto per Fedato, Disanto e Astrologo, col primo che ha praticamente perso tutta la stagione e gli altri due che hanno avuto davvero pochissimo tempo per integrarsi e mettersi in mostra; sufficiente il contributo di Sabbione dopo un avvio limitato dagli infortuni, mentre chi ha saputo mettersi in mostra è stato Yeboah, che ha sinceramente impressionato come centravanti di manovra moderno in grado di far reparto da solo ma non certo implacabile sottoporta: comunque è in prestito dal Verona, quindi improbabile che sia confermato. Tutti gli altri erano giocatori ereditati dalla rosa allestita da Deoma negli anni precedenti, soprattutto la difesa era potenzialmente rimasta uguale, ma le prestazioni sono cambiate radicalmente e quella che sembrava una rosa di centrali piuttosto affidabile, forse perché meno protetta dall'impostazione della squadra, ha spesso subito gol con una facilità che non ci saremmo aspettati.
Con lo staff dirigenziale sportivo sconfessato da Bulgarella stesso, rimane da valutare il lavoro di Gorgone e qua il giudizio diventa ancora più difficile, perché il tecnico esordiente romano si è presentato con un calcio moderno e spumeggiante, salvo poi rivedere l'impostazione della squadra quando i risultati hanno iniziato a scarseggiare e affidarsi a una difesa a tre che non ha mai pienamente convinto, così come il suo ingegno nel cercare di cambiare le partite in corsa, elemento questo fondamentale nell'era delle cinque sostituzioni. Comunque, come abbiamo più volte sottolineato, determinare oggettivamente il valore dei giocatori della Serie C è francamente abbastanza complicato, quindi sarebbe spericolato affermare che Gorgone abbia tirato fuori da questa rosa meno di quanto questa potesse offrire.
Ci sono però due cose che ci sentiamo di affermare con un certo grado di certezza. La prima è che il tecnico romano ha dimostrato con i fatti, cioè preferendo sovente schierare fuori ruolo alcuni titolari piuttosto di affidarsi alle riserve, di aver ben presto sfiduciato diversi elementi a sua disposizione (Alagna, Djbril, Russo, Magnaghi, a un certo punto anche Guadagni), di fatto riducendo a 13-14 elementi il gruppo da cui plasmare la squadra e, implicitamente, affermando la scarsa funzionalità dei giocatori rispetto ai programmi e, forse, al suo stile di gioco. La seconda cosa certa è che il presidente è stato più o meno d'accordo con Gorgone nel ritenere la rosa non adeguata, tant'è che a fronte della scarsità dei risultati ha liquidato direttore generale e sportivo e tenuto in panchina l'allenatore.
Guardando al futuro, vogliamo anche riepilogare la situazione contrattuale dei rossoneri: Tiritiello, Djibril e Visconti sono sotto contratto fino al 2026; Magnaghi, Gucher, Fedato, Sabbione, Russo, Guadagni, De Maria, Quirini fino al 2025, così come Ravasio, che rientrerà dal prestito al Sorrento dopo un'annata in doppia cifra in quanto a gol. Tutti gli altri vanno in scadenza e, quindi, potrebbero potenzialmente lasciare la Lucchese, compreso Rizzo Pinna, il migliore dei rossoneri d'annata e che verosimilmente riuscirà a strappare qualche offerta che lo porterà lontano da Lucca. Da segnalare anche che lo scollamento che si è venuto a creare fra squadra e tifoseria ha creato un ambiente che, probabilmente, non è molto attrattivo per i giocatori, il che potrebbe significare che anche qualcuno sotto contratto potrebbe chiedere la cessione, soprattutto quelli che possono aver mercato come Tiritiello, Ravasio e Gucher.
Il quadro che ne esce, come si vede, è quello di un’annata sportiva praticamente gettata alle ortiche e di una squadra da rifondare quasi radicalmente ma, ovviamente, in questo momento non è possibile ipotizzare in che modo verrà forgiata la Lucchese del futuro visto che non sappiamo chi sarà il direttore sportivo, figura che sovente si porta dietro anche la proposta di un allenatore di fiducia e dalla cui scelta, pertanto, forse dipende anche la conferma di Gorgone, sempre che nel frattempo il tecnico non abbia già riscosso l'interesse di altre squadre.
L'ex attaccante era già stato accostato lo scorso anno alla Pantera, tanto da essere la prima scelta nel ruolo di diesse dell'allora direttore generale Mangiarano. In quel caso però la presidenza decise di puntare su Frara: ora è di nuovo in lizza
Anche in questa stagione, a riprova di un sistema incapace di autoriformarsi, i playoff di Serie C sono costretti a slittare per il ricorso stavolta del Taranto. In attesa dell'udienza al Coni, il presidente della Lega Pro ha posticipato gli inizi dei play off. Ecco le nuove date:
Il vice allenatore: "Abbiamo provato a vincere, a pesare però sono state anche le diverse assenze che avevamo. Oggi, come in molte gare di questa stagione, non siamo stati in grado di finalizzare le situazioni da rete che ci sono capitate. Inutile parlare del passato, adesso guarderemo al futuro"
Il portierone torna titolare e dà sicurezza a un reparto dove le assenze non si contano. Grande impegno di Quirini, bene Fazzi al centro della difesa, in avanti Yeboah e Russo sbagliano due gol fatti: le pagelle di Gazzetta

Con il pareggio ottenuto sul campo dell'Ancona, si è chiusa ufficialmente la stagione 2023/24 della Lucchese. Un'annata che ha lasciato nel complesso tanto amaro in bocca. In casa rossonera è arrivato il momento di pianificare il futuro. Il primo tassello da aggiungere sarà la nomina di un nuovo direttore sportivo.
Nelle scorse settimane, erano circolati anche i nomi dell'ex Catania Antonello Laneri e di Ernesto Salvini, fino allo scorso anno al Siena. Secondo quanto raccolto dalla nostra redazione, nelle scorse ore avrebbe preso quota la pista che porta a Felice Evacuo. L'ex attaccante era già stato accostato lo scorso anno alla Pantera, tanto da essere la prima scelta nel ruolo di ds dell'allora direttore generale Mangiarano. In quel caso però la presidenza decise di puntare su Frara.
Nativo di Pompei, durante la sua carriera da calciatore Evacuo ha militato per tanti anni sia in Serie B che nel campionato di Serie C, del quale è capocannoniere assoluto con 175 gol in 464. Nel suo palmares, può vantare 2 Supercoppe di Serie C e 2 campionati di Serie C. Dopo aver appeso gli scarpini al chiodo nel 2022, la scorsa estate Evacuo ha ottenuto l'abilitazione come direttore sportivo. Nel caso in cui si dovessero concretizzare le voci che lo vogliono alla Lucchese, per il classe 1981 si tratterebbe della prima esperienza in queste vesti.
E' tempo di tracciare il bilancio dell'annata rossonera e il giudizio non può che essere largamente fallimentare visti gli obiettivi dichiarati a inizio stagione e le aspettative create nella tifoseria: la Lucchese avrebbe dovuto piazzarsi fra le prime cinque-sei squadre del girone, agganciare i playoff e la rosa avrebbe dovuto...

Il portierone torna titolare e dà sicurezza a un reparto dove le assenze non si contano. Grande impegno di Quirini, bene Fazzi al centro della difesa, in avanti Yeboah e Russo sbagliano due gol fatti: le pagelle di Gazzetta

Mercoledi 1 Maggio c'è la seconda partita dei play off, un match da dentro fuori. Ricordiamo che per poter giocare le semifinali è necessario che il Bcl vinca due partite consecutive, ad oggi però, Saronno lo tiene sotto scacco, avendo vinto sabato scorso una delle tre partite in calendario, portandosi sull'1/0.
La prima partita ha visto il Bcl partire con decisione tanto da porsi alla guida del match in brevissimo tempo per poi giocarsela fino a cedere di schianto negli ultimi tre minuti del secondo quarto, incassando un parziale, dal quale non è più riuscito, malgrado si sia aggiudicato la terza e quarta frazione di gioco, a venirne fuori.
Adesso il Bcl ha la possibilità di pareggiare il conto e portarsi sull'1/1 per poi andarsela a giocare definitivamente sabato prossimo a Saronno. La sconfitta subita non ha minimamente intaccato lo spirito combattivo della squadra, Tempestini, Trentin e Del Debbio hanno quasi ultimato il recupero fisico e sono ormai prossimi a tornare al 100% della loro forma.
La squadra sa benissimo cosa gli aspetta sul campo del palatagliate, sanno che la partita più difficile dei play off è toccate a loro, non che con le altre squadre sarebbe stata una passeggiata di salute, ma certamente avrebbero saputo, avendole già incontrate nella prima fase, come affrontarle fin dal primo impegno.
E' con questa consapevolezza che scenderanno in campo perché oltre a conoscere il valore dell'avversario, hanno la piena contezza di chi sono e di cosa sono capaci, sanno molto bene che su, alla palestra Ronchi di Saronno, non hanno giocato la loro migliore partita, non erano al massimo della forma e non sono riusciti se non in qualche lampo di gioco a dare il loro meglio.
I ragazzi sono davvero tutti quanti molto motivati e a suonare la carica, riconoscendo apertamente di aver fatto una prova opaca nella prima partita e usando questa specie di – coming out – per dare maggiore carica, arrivano le parole di coach Olivieri
"Gara uno è stata un indicatore molto importante. Ha confermato il fatto che Saronno è una squadra solida. Ci hanno messo in difficoltà con la loro difesa molto fisica che chiude gli spazi vicino a canestro. In attacco si sono confermati molto duttili e si sono adattati molto velocemente alle scelte difensive che avevamo preparato. Ci sono anche molti demeriti nostri, perché la nostra prestazione ha agevolato i loro piani. In gara due abbiamo preparato degli aggiustamenti semplici in attacco, che confidiamo, aiutino i ragazzi a essere più prolifici ed efficaci. Indubbiamente in gara uno abbiamo fatto una prestazione opaca condita da troppe palle perse ed errori, anche banali, al tiro. Tutto questo per dire che abbiamo tutte le carte in regola per portare la serie a gara tre. Gli acciaccati stanno recuperando e sarà fondamentale che tutti diano il 110 per cento. Dobbiamo giocare con determinazione e voglia di vincere per regalare ai tifosi del BCL, e a noi stessi, una vittoria."
A dare ancora più energia e vigore alla truppa biancorossa sono i molti messaggi e mail che arrivano in società che preludono ad un'importante e massiccia presenza di pubblico che al momento in cui raggiunge numeri importanti diventa a pieno titolo il sesto uomo in campo. La palla sarà scodellata Mercoledi 1 Maggio alle ore 19 dal sig. Marinaro di Pisa coadiuvato da Parigi di Firenze.
I rossoneri chiudono il campionato che ha regalato davvero poche gioie ai tifosi con un pari a reti bianche a Ancona dove sono scesi in campo molti giovani, come sottolineano i quotidiani in edicola. Ora c'è da programmare il futuro
Per il Bcl una partita non particolarmente fortunata, ma dove Saronno ha fatto valere tutto il suo peso chiudendo la prima dei play off sul punteggio di 81/65
Per passare il turno dei quarti ed approdare alle semifinali, occorrerà vincere due partite su tre e farlo contro un avversario come il Saronno che ha già sbaragliato la concorrenza toscana vincendo con Cecina, Empoli e anche ribaltando il risultato con l'Etrusca San Miniato
Nei Play in silver/gold il maggior numero di punti fatti è del Cecina con 702 punti, secondo posto per il Bcl con 690 punti, terzo posto, Saronno con 673, a seguire tutte le altre. 690 è un numero confortante per il Bcl che lo pone tra gli attacchi più prolifici...

Article: 16 e 17 maggio MEDITeH Beyond, la scienza medica più vicina alla gente
Negli ultimi anni, seguendo la strada indicata dal 2017 in poi dal Centro Nazionale per la Telemedicina dell’Istituto Superiore di Sanità (CNTNT) diretto dal professore Francesco Gabbrielli, l’Italia sta sviluppando per tutta la popolazione italiana la telemedicina quale strumento al servizio della medicina, amplificandone finalità e potenzialità, abbattendo barriere fisiche determinate dalla distanza, aumentando l’equità di accesso e la qualità dell’assistenza.
Diagnosi, terapia e cura, possono essere sempre più agevolate da tali servizi, con particolare rilievo nel caso dei pazienti cronici e fragili, ossia quelli che richiedono un monitoraggio costante. Le potenzialità di tale tecnologia possono instaurare un cambiamento e sostenere la riorganizzazione dei servizi sanitari, che potranno essere equamente distribuiti sul territorio, nazionale ma non solo, riducendo le disuguaglianze tra aree dove vi è una maggiore presenza di presidi sanitari e quelle invece meno servite. Tutto questo può essere sostenuto anche dagli investimenti previsti nel PNRR, ma è necessaria l’attenta collaborazione tra tutti gli stakeholder del sistema salute: centri di ricerca, università, enti sanitari, imprese produttive e Istituzioni. La collaborazione è il punto essenziale per realizzare servizi locali di sanità digitale, ma anche per rendere possibili nuovi sviluppi di soluzioni tecnologiche e progressi in medicina. Tale collaborazione deve potersi espendere a livello internazionale riercando condivisione, collaborazione e scambio.
“MEDITeH Beyond è il primo Summit che vuole promuovere la collaborazione in sanità digitale oltrepassando le sponde del Mediterraneo e, ancora oltre, verso l’Africa e il Medio Oriente. Ma, soprattutto, è il punto di partenza di nuove partnership per rendere concreta, nei nostri Paesi, l’applicazione delle tecnologie digitali al progresso della medicina”. Con queste parole il professore Francesco Gabbrielli, professore di e-Health all’Università San Raffaele di Roma e oggi anche Direttore del Centro Nazionale per le linee guida in Telemedicina-SIT, spiega l’importanza strategica di questa promettente collaborazione internazionale.
Le due giornate di Summit, promosse da Diplomatia con l’Health Policy Commission e la Direzione Scientifica dello stesso Gabbrielli, saranno incentrati sullo studio e la condivisione di idee e progetti, concreti, provenienti da tutti i Paesi aderenti.
Il primo giorno prevede, oltre ai saluti istituzionali, una sessione di approfondimento sull’evoluzione delle scienze biomediche e unworkshop per condividere lo scenario, presente e futuro prossimo, sulle tecnologie digitali al servizio del settore medico-scientifico, con relazioni frontali di illustri scienziati e professionisti nazionali e internazionali invitati al Summit.
“L’Italia è, per tradizione, il nord dei paesi del Mediterraneo e il sud dell’Europa, ovvero un elemento di congiunzione, inoltre viene vista come una Nazione avanzata in ambito medico, in tutta Europa. Questo ci conferisce due responsabilità: aiutare gli altri a fornire una medicina di valore ai pazienti che spesso non ne hanno le possibilità. E, allo stesso tempo, promuovere, a livello di rete nell’area del Mediterraneo, lo sviluppo della medicina per favorire, anche laddove in alcuni casi non è semplice, un rapporto medico-paziente migliore”. Queste le parole del professore Alberico L. Catapano, Direttore del Dipartimento di Farmacologia e Scienze Biomolecolari all’Università Statale di Milano, uno dei relatori nazionali invitati a portare il loro contributo al congresso e membro del comitato scientifico.
Il secondo giorno del Summit è invece dedicato ai lavori di gruppo sulla sanità digitale a cui parteciperanno i delegati accreditati al Summit. La discussione affronterà diverse macro-tematiche, evidenziando le possibilità di sviluppo dei servizi di telemedicina nella realtà attuale e mettendo in luce le prospettive della ricerca applicativa in ambito sanitario per mezzo delle tecnologie digitali. Le aree di lavoro saranno le seguenti: accessibilità al trattamento e alla prevenzione; gestione delle grandi emergenze (quali, ad esempio, pandemie, terremoti e disastri naturali); protezione dei pazienti cronici; cura e riabilitazione nella sanità digitale; cura e ricerca clinica in oncologia.
Nel corso dei tavoli di lavoro, a cui gli uditori iscritti al Summit potranno assistere, i delegati porteranno le loro idee e contribuiranno all’elaborazione di un breve position paper.
“La telemedicina e la medicina stessa sono un gioco di squadra e questo impone che si lavori nel catturare tutte le differenze possibili. Collaborare con realtà diverse ci permette di visualizzare possibili scenari e difficoltà future e prepararci a rispondere. l’Italia è sempre stata proiettata nell’area culturale mediterranea e, se nell’ultimo secolo e mezzo, gli equilibri internazionali si sono spostati di più verso l’Atlantico, è vero che l’Italia per millenni ha giocato un ruolo molto importante nell’area mediterranea estesa che include il Medio Oriente. E questo ci rende forieri di un valore particolare nelle nostre collaborazioni europee transatlantiche, dove portiamo un unicum culturale che pochi altri giocatori possono vantare”, sostiene il professore Marco Manca, Presidente e co-Founder di ScimPulse Foundation, che guiderà uno dei tavoli di discussione, oltre a far parte, anche lui, del comitato scientifico.
Il position paper generale che verrà stilato dal comitato scientifico a partire dai contributi dei gruppo di lavoro sarà successivamente diffuso pubblicamente, quale strumento per facilitare, nei prossimi anni, la collaborazione tra gli enti sanitari, i centri di ricerca, le università, e le imprese produttive dei Paesi che aderiscono formalmente al Summit.
MEDITeH Beyond è quindi solo il primo passo nella costruzione di una rete collaborativa duratura, per lo sviluppo della medicina tramite la tecnologia digitale tra Mediterraneo, Africa e Medio Oritente, in cui l’Italia si propone quale promotore e facilitatore.

Article: Fisco, il Cdm vara la revisione Irpef e Ires
Redditi dei terreni
Si modifica la disciplina relativa alla determinazione del reddito agrario: attualmente tale reddito è correlato esclusivamente alle attività agricole che vengono svolte sul terreno. La nuova disciplina comprende anche le attività non incentrate sullo sfruttamento diretto del terreno agricolo, quali le cosiddette ‘colture fuori suolò (es. attività idroponica), anche svolte in immobili, rientranti in specifiche categorie catastali ed entro determinati limiti (la parte eccedente del reddito concorrerà alla formazione del reddito d’impresa), e le attività dirette alla produzione di beni anche immateriali mediante coltivazione, allevamento, silvicoltura che concorrono alla tutela dell’ambiente, nei limiti dei corrispettivi delle cessioni di beni registrate o soggette a registrazione a fini IVA. Di conseguenza, si qualifica reddito dominicale quello correlato agli immobili utilizzati per le colture fuori suolo, che quindi non sono produttivi di reddito di fabbricati, se non sono oggetto di locazione.
Redditi da lavoro dipendente
Si ampliano le componenti escluse dalla formazione del reddito di lavoro dipendente. In particolare, sono esclusi i contributi e premi versati dal datore di lavoro per i familiari a carico dei dipendenti per prestazioni, anche in forma assicurativa, aventi per oggetto il rischio di non autosufficienza nel compimento degli atti della vita quotidiana, o aventi per oggetto il rischio di gravi patologie.
Inoltre, nelle more dell’introduzione di un regime fiscale sostitutivo per la tredicesima mensilità, si prevede l’erogazione, nel mese di gennaio 2025, di un’indennità di 100 euro ai lavoratori dipendenti per i quali, nell’anno 2024, ricorrano congiuntamente le seguenti condizioni:
– reddito complessivo non superiore a 28.000 euro;
– coniuge non separato e almeno un figlio, entrambi a carico, oppure almeno un figlio a carico, ove l’altro genitore manchi o non abbia riconosciuto il figlio e il contribuente non sia coniugato o, se coniugato, si sia successivamente separato, o se vi siano figli adottivi, affidati o affiliati del solo contribuente e questi non sia coniugato o, se coniugato, si sia successivamente separato;
– imposta lorda determinata sui redditi da lavoro dipendente (con esclusione di pensioni e di assegni a esse equiparati), percepiti dal lavoratore, d’importo superiore a quello delle detrazioni spettanti.
Redditi da lavoro autonomo
Si introduce, quale criterio generale di determinazione del reddito da lavoro autonomo, il principio di onnicomprensività (in analogia ai lavoratori dipendenti): il reddito derivante dall’esercizio di arti e professioni sarà costituito dalla differenza tra tutte le somme e i valori in genere, a qualunque titolo percepiti nel periodo d’imposta in relazione all’attività artistica o professionale e l’ammontare delle spese sostenute nel periodo stesso nell’esercizio dell’attività. Inoltre, si prevede che siano escluse dalla formazione del reddito, oltre ai contributi assistenziali e previdenziali, anche: le somme percepite a titolo di rimborso delle spese sostenute per l’esecuzione di un incarico e addebitate al committente e il riaddebito ad altri soggetti delle spese sostenute per l’uso comune degli immobili utilizzati, anche promiscuamente, per l’esercizio di tali attività e per i servizi ad essi connessi.
Si conferma il principio di cassa quale criterio di imputazione temporale dei componenti di reddito al periodo di imposta (pertanto i compensi rilevano al momento della percezione e i costi sono deducibili nell’esercizio di effettivo sostenimento della spesa), sono salve le deroghe previste (es. per ammortamenti, canoni di leasing e quote di TFR).
Si estende il regime della tassazione separata alle plusvalenze derivanti dalla cessione a titolo oneroso di partecipazioni in associazioni, società ed enti, comunque riferibili all’attività artistica professionale.
Si prevede un’apposita disciplina relativa alla deducibilità delle spese relative a beni ed elementi immateriali sostenute nell’esercizio di arti e professioni.
Si introduce il principio di neutralità fiscale (non realizzando quindi plusvalenze o minusvalenze) con riferimento a: operazioni straordinarie concernenti i conferimenti, trasformazioni, fusioni e scissioni relativi a società tra professionisti; apporti in associazioni senza personalità giuridica costituite fra persone fisiche per l’esercizio in forma associata di arti e professioni o in società semplici; apporti delle posizioni partecipative nelle associazioni professionali o società semplici in altre associazioni o società costituite per l’esercizio in forma associata di arti e professioni o in società tra professionisti.
In merito al regime temporale di applicazione delle nuove misure:
– in materia di redditi da lavoro autonomo, l’applicazione è prevista a partire dal periodo d’imposta in corso alla data di entrata in vigore del decreto;
– in relazione alle spese sostenute per l’esecuzione di un incarico e addebitate analiticamente in capo al committente, si istituisce un regime transitorio in base al quale fino al 31 dicembre 2024 continuano ad applicarsi le disposizioni in vigore anteriormente alle modifiche apportate dal decreto, riguardanti la deducibilità delle spese e la concorrenza alla formazione del reddito delle relative somme percepite a titolo di rimborso delle medesime;
– in materia d’imputazione temporale dei compensi assoggettati a ritenuta, le nuove disposizione hanno effetto anche per i periodi di imposta antecedenti a quello in corso alla data di entrata in vigore del decreto, se le relative dichiarazioni, validamente presentate, risultano conformi alla nuova disciplina. Restano comunque fermi gli accertamenti e le liquidazioni di imposta divenuti definitivi.
Redditi diversi
Si stabilisce che per i terreni suscettibili di utilizzazione edificatoria acquistati per effetto di donazione, si assume come prezzo di acquisto quello sostenuto dal donante, aumentato dell’imposta sulle donazioni nonchè di ogni altro costo successivo inerente. Inoltre, con riferimento alle cessioni degli immobili acquisiti per donazione da non più di cinque anni, si prevede la concorrenza alla formazione del costo di acquisto anche dell’imposta sulle donazioni nonchè di ogni altro costo successivo inerente, in analogia con quanto attualmente previsto con riguardo ai terreni acquistati per effetto di successione.
– Disposizioni in materia di redditi d’impresa
Si realizza una prima fase di attuazione della delega in materia di razionalizzazione e semplificazione dei regimi di riallineamento dei valori fiscali a quelli contabili e di modifica dei criteri di determinazione dei redditi di impresa.
In materia di determinazione della base imponibile delle società e degli enti commerciali residenti, al fine di avvicinare valori contabili e valori fiscali, si modifica il trattamento tributario:
– delle sopravvenienze attive derivanti da proventi in denaro o in natura conseguiti a titolo di contributo o di liberalità, che potranno concorrere a formare il reddito esclusivamente nell’esercizio in cui sono incassati;
– della valutazione delle rimanenze finali di opere, forniture e servizi;
– delle differenze sui cambi.
Inoltre, si introduce una disciplina in materia di riallineamenti dei disallineamenti tra valori fiscali e valori contabili volta ad assicurare l’omogeneizzazione delle regole proprie dei diversi regimi di riallineamento attualmente esistenti.
Si interviene in materia di conferimenti di azienda effettuati tra soggetti residenti e nell’esercizio di imprese commerciali, introducendo la possibilità, per la società conferitaria, di optare, nella dichiarazione dei redditi relativa al periodo d’imposta nel corso del quale avvenga il conferimento, per l’applicazione di un’imposta sostitutiva (da versare in un’unica soluzione ed entro uno specifico termine) sui maggiori valori attribuiti in bilancio a immobilizzazioni materiali e immateriali relativi all’azienda ricevuta e si introduce una disciplina inerente all’entrata in vigore e al regime transitorio connesso alle nuove disposizioni in materia di riallineamento.
Disposizioni ulteriori
Si modifica il regime di riporto delle perdite da parte delle società residenti, ai fini della determinazione della base imponibile IRES, intervenendo, in particolare, in materia di fusione, di scissione, di scissione per scorporo, di conferimenti di partecipazioni in società e di liquidazione.

Article: G7, l’agenda ambientale accelera. Meno emissioni e più rinnovabili
Il documento finale del Vertice, nel ribadire gli impegni già assunti nelle precedenti sessioni del G7, ne avvia la concreta e significativa attuazione.
In particolare sul fronte energetico, i Paesi G7 si sono impegnati a chiudere le proprie centrali a carbone entro la prima metà del prossimo decennio (2035 al più tardi) o comunque in una data compatibile con l’obbiettivo di mantenere l’aumento di temperatura entro il grado e mezzo, limitandone nel frattempo l’uso al minimo necessario. In materia di rinnovabili per attuare l’impegno assunto alla COP 28 di triplicare la capacità di produzione al 2030, i G7 si sono impegnati a contribuire a sestuplicare la capacità degli accumuli di energia al 2030, portandola fino a 1.5 TW, a livello globale. Per il nucleare, i paesi G7 hanno deciso di istituire un Gruppo di Lavoro sull’Energia da Fusione per condividere le migliori pratiche ed esplorare le aree di cooperazione per accelerare lo sviluppo e la dimostrazione di impianti a fusione, incoraggiando l’aumento degli investimenti privati e pubblici.
E’ stato inoltre deciso di favorire il coordinamento all’interno del G7 sugli aspetti regolatori. Ulteriori impegni sono: la riduzione del 75% al 2030 delle emissioni di gas metano dalle filiere dei carburanti fossili; decarbonizzazione degli impianti industriali e hard-to abate ricorrendo alle tecnologie innovative tra cui CCS, l’idrogeno rinnovabile a basse emissioni e biometano; promuovere la sicurezza di approvvigionamento delle materie prime critiche mediante la concreta attuazione del Piano previsto al G7 dello scorso anno. Sono state inoltre confermate le diverse opzioni per la decarbonizzazione del settore stradale. Importante tutta la parte che riguarda l’adattamento ai cambiamenti climatici in cui si registrano una serie di impegni e nuove iniziative come “G7 Adaptation Accelerator Hub” che nasce dall’esigenza di trasformare le priorità dei piani di adattamento dei paesi in via di sviluppo più vulnerabili in piani d’investimento capaci di attrarre finanziamenti pubblici e privati. L’impegno per la collaborazione in particolare con i paesi africani, sulla scorta della impostazione politico-culturale del “Piano Mattei” è evidenziata altresì dalla creazione di un Hub del G7 dedicato alla promozione di un approccio comune da adottare nelle iniziative progettuali di gestione sostenibile del suolo in Africa e nel bacino del Mediterraneo. In materia di economia circolare di rilievo è la decisione di incaricare “l’Alleanza del G7 sull’Efficienza delle Risorse” di lavorare, entro la fine del 2024.

Article: Como – Diventa definitiva oggi la condanna per Omar Querenzi, trentaquattrenne di Albiolo, detenuto dall’11 agosto 2022, quando era stato arrestato per l’omicidio di Giuseppe Mazza, il pensionato di 76 anni colpito alla gola con un pezzo di vetro mentre si trovava all’interno della sua auto parcheggiata alle spalle di via Giussani, e per il tentato omicidio di un ragazzo di 25 anni alla fermata del bus, ferito allo stesso modo.
A febbraio Querenzi è stato condannato a 20 anni di reclusione, con rito abbreviato, ma i suoi difensori, gli avvocati Denise Canu e Pasquale Saggiomo, hanno deciso di non ricorrere in Appello, ritenendo più opportuno beneficiare della possibilità concessa dalla Legge Cartabia: lo sconto di un sesto della pena per chi rinuncia all’impugnazione delle sentenze dei processo celebrati con rito abbreviato. A conti fatti, 40 mesi di sconto, tre anni e tre mesi in meno. Una decisione presa confrontandosi con il loro assistito, e valutando pro e contro che sarebbero derivati dalla scelta di affrontare un ulteriori grado di giudizio, del quale non era possibile prevedere gli esiti.
I criteri della sua condanna, erano stati spiegati nelle motivazioni: secondo il giudice, i fatti di cui era accusato Querenzi erano "pacifici", caratterizzati da "accentuata colpevolezza" e "incontrovertibile pericolosità sociale". Epilogo di violenze reiterate scaturite dalla "rabbia per le ingiustizie del mancato accoglimento, da parte dei sanitari ospedalieri, della sua richiesta di trattamento, rimettendolo in strada", a cui si era aggiunto "il rifiuto del suo stesso genitore di accoglierlo e di andare a prenderlo".
Così quel giorno Querenzi si era quindi avviato a piedi dall’ospedale Sant’Anna verso Como, minacciando e ferendo con una bottiglia due bambini, ferendo alla gola il giovane alla fermata del bus di via Giussani, e uccidendo con le stesse modalità, e senza alcun motivo, Giuseppe Mazza, seduto all’interno della sua auto parcheggiata poco distante. Fino a essere fermato e arrestato dalla polizia.

Article: Como – Una tossicodipendente di 51 anni in piena crisi che grida, chiede aiuto, viene fatta salire su un’ambulanza circondata da soccorritori e da poliziotti, intervenuti con due pattuglie. Un’altra donna accanto a lei in condizioni barcollanti. Dalla parte opposta della strada, a pochi metri di distanza, un gruppo di giovanissimi spacciatori si prende la scena. Piazzati sull’ingresso di un condominio, ridono, gridano, fischiano per chiamarsi. Scene di ordinaria convivenza tra i fortunati residenti di via Anzani e via Magenta, e chi stabilmente popola quella strada, tenendola in scacco.
Liti in pieno giorno in mezzo alla strada, bottiglie frantumate, tentativi di aggressione alle auto che passano mentre sono in corso gli scontri. Dalle finestre dei condomini si possono solo osservare le pattuglie e le ambulanze che vanno e vengono, fare video e foto, ormai archiviata ogni speranza nata con la promessa elettorale del sindaco Alessandro Rapinese di rimettere ordine in questa zona. Incuranti della "zona rossa" che impedisce la vendita di alcol.
Nel frattempo , da un anno gli "squadroni eliportati cacciatori" dei carabinieri presidiano i boschi al confine tra Como e Varese. Un regalo del Ministero dell’Interno che ogni settimana produce sequestri di qualche grammo di stupefacenti, grazie a interventi che vengono svolti su indicazione dei carabinieri delle stazioni e dei reparti territoriali, da sempre veri e unici conoscitori dei luoghi in cui si annidano bivacchi e spacciatori. Sono loro che sanno dove eseguire gli arresti, intercettare i consumatori. Ora portandosi al seguito i "cacciatori", nati come unità speciali per contrastare la criminalità di alto profilo annidata in zone impervie, e ora utilizzati per la caccia ai nordafricani dello spaccio al dettaglio.
A Como garantiscono una presenza media di venti militari al giorno provenienti da Calabria e Sardegna, alloggiati in un hotel di Varese, i cui costi vengono rigorosamente non divulgati. Volendo fare un conto ipotetico: pernottamento e mezza pensione, indennizzi e trasferte, una stima al ribasso - forse moltissimo al ribasso - di 50 euro al giorno per militare, 30mila euro al mese, 360mila euro in un anno. Ogni sequestro di droga che avviene solo nella fascia del Canturino o Bassa Comasca, di qualunque anche minima entità, a distanza di poche ore viene puntualmente enfatizzata da un comunicato stampa del Ministero dell’Interno, l’applauso alla "lotta contro i venditori di morte".
Che intanto si moltiplicano, e in poche ore si appropriano degli spazi lasciati liberi da chi viene arrestato. Altri militari, in divisa mimetica, presidiano da mesi il centro città, garantendo sicurezza dove spesso c’è già. Da ieri anche nelle stazioni ferroviarie: benissimo. Ma ancora una volta, nessuno calcola la zona di via Anzani. Dove i "venditori di morte" bivaccano sui marciapiedi senza nemmeno lo sforzo di montarsi una tendina, e dove i "consumatori di morte" gridano in mezzo alla strada deliranti, stanno male. O si aggrediscono. Tengono in s cacco un intero quartiere dove vive, sempre peggio, gente per bene, che per qualche settimana, in piena campagna elettorale, alla possibilità di risanamento di queste strade ci aveva creduto davvero.

Article: Ragazze ammiccanti oppure uomini che sembrano appena usciti da un fotoromanzo. Non è difficile abboccare a queste esche, che possono essere persone reali o personaggi di fantasia, creati ad arte, con foto rubate o con l’aiuto dell’intelligenza artificiale. Ma dietro c’è sempre un truffatore o un’organizzazione criminale. L’obiettivo è lo stesso: far abboccare il malcapitato ammaliandolo, cuocendolo a puntino fino a indurlo a inviare foto e video intimi per poi passare al ricatto: "Se non mi paghi, giro tutto ai tuoi contatti".
Si chiama “sextortion“, estorsione sessuale, ed è un reato. "Un fenomeno che esiste non da ieri, ma dall’altro ieri", spiega Ivano Zoppi, presidente di Pepita onlus, cooperativa sociale che si occupa di progetti educativi, e segretario generale di Fondazione Carolina voluta da Paolo Picchio, il papà della quattordicenne che si tolse la vita a gennaio del 2013 perché vittima di messaggi d’odio suo social. E sempre di più "l’estorsione sessuale è compiuta ai danni di adolescenti, che ricercano “l’esotico nell’erotico“ anche vedendo gli adulti che lo fanno".
La truffa crea nella vittima un profondo senso di colpa e angoscia. Negli Usa è allarme: secondo l’FBI, da settembre 2021 a marzo 2023 almeno 20 minorenni si sono suicidati dopo essere caduti nella rete del sexortion. Nel nostro Paese? "Per fortuna non abbiamo notizia di ragazzi suicidatisi per questo motivo – risponde Zoppi – ma riceviamo decine di segnalazioni. Spesso siamo i primi a cui i ragazzi si rivolgono, perché per vergogna e senso di colpa non ne parlano ai genitori. E li aiutiamo. Il primo passo è denunciare". E non pagare. Mai. Questo è il primo consiglio della polizia postale: "Mai cedere al ricatto pagando le somme richieste. Non smetteranno di chiedere soldi e le richieste si faranno man mano più insistenti".
Nel 2023, a Milano, la polizia postale ha raccolto 118 denunce complessivamente, di adulti e minori. Significa una ogni tre giorni. Più del doppio dell’anno precedente (57 denunce). Il numero di minori è invariato: 11 persone, quasi sempre maschi. La proporzione resta allargando il campo a tutta la Lombardia: 139 casi segnalati nel 2022, diventati 242 nel 2023. In testa tra chi cade in trappola, uomini maggiorenni (passati da 98 a 190). Invariato il numero di adolescenti: da 23 a 24 casi, di cui 20 riguardanti maschi.
Alcuni uomini sono arrivati a sborsare fino a 10 mila euro per impedire la diffusione dei loro video intimi alla cerchia dei conoscenti sui social. In media, 2mila persone all’anno da tutta Italia si rivolgono alla onlus milanese PermessoNegato, come riportato su queste pagine nei mesi scorsi, per un supporto. Nel caso la vittima sia minorenne, "la questione si complica perché il ragazzo ha meno strumenti dell’adulto, sia per comprendere la situazione e sia per uscirne", continua Zoppi.
"Noi abbiamo assistito diversi ragazzi. Per esempio un adolescente che mentre era a scuola, navigando on line di nascosto si è accorto di una richiesta di amicizia di una ragazza bellissima. “Non posso farmi sfuggire una così“, ha pensato, così ha accettato la sua amicizia e poi ha iniziato a chattare con lei. Tempo pochi minuti e la ragazza ha iniziato a spogliarsi, invitando poi lui a fare lo stesso. A quel punto il ragazzo è andato in bagno e si è ripreso in atteggiamenti intimi, mandando tutto a lei. Poi è rientrato in classe. Ma dopo pochi minuti è scattato il ricatto: gli è arrivato un link con il video caricato su un sito porno, pronto per essere diffuso on line. “Lo pubblico se non mi mandi subito 5mila euro“. Lui è andato nel panico e ci ha contattati, chiedendoci consiglio su cosa fare. Noi gli abbiamo subito detto di non pagare e di denunciare il caso. Così ha fatto. Dopo la denuncia, generalmente, è difficile smantellare la banda che architetta questi raggiri, che di solito agisce dall’estero".
Altri giovanissimi caduti nella rete "purtroppo hanno mandato dei soldi, prendendoli di nascosto ai genitori o procurandoseli in qualche modo. Noi cerchiamo sempre di accompagnarli a denunciare, poi li aiutiamo a prendere coscienza: vale la pena correre il rischio? Nello stesso tempo li aiutiamo a non demoralizzarsi, perché i truffatori sono abili e anche gli adulti cascano in queste trappole. Perché mettersi a nudo, in tutti i sensi, è più facile se c’è la mediazione dello schermo".

Article: In lieve calo i rischi per la stabilità finanziaria dell’Italia
“Sebbene ancora fragile, il quadro macroeconomico si è stabilizzato, in un contesto caratterizzato da solidità del mercato del lavoro, consolidamento del processo di disinflazione e miglioramento del saldo delle partite correnti. Le più recenti previsioni prefigurano inoltre un rafforzamento della crescita nella seconda parte dell’anno. Il permanere del rapporto tra debito pubblico e PIL su valori elevati rimane tuttavia un fattore di rischio, in particolare in caso di sviluppi dell’economia meno favorevoli di quanto atteso”, prosegue Bankitalia.
“Il quadro macroeconomico si è stabilizzato, in un contesto caratterizzato da solidità del mercato del lavoro, consolidamento del processo di disinflazione e miglioramento del saldo delle partite correnti. La crescita è attesa in miglioramento nella seconda parte dell’anno – si legge nel rapporto -. Il permanere del rapporto tra debito pubblico e PIL su valori elevati rimane tuttavia un fattore di rischio, in particolare in caso di sviluppi dell’economia meno favorevoli di quanto atteso”.
“Nel 2023 l’economia globale ha rallentato e le previsioni di crescita per l’anno in corso, sebbene riviste leggermente al rialzo, prefigurano un’attività nel complesso ancora debole – sottolinea Bankitalia -. Dall’inizio del 2024 il calo dell’inflazione si è fermato negli Stati Uniti, mentre è proseguito nell’area dell’euro e nel Regno Unito. Permangono rischi inflazionistici legati al possibile impatto dei conflitti in Ucraina e in Medio Oriente sui prezzi dell’energia”.

Article: “Il nostro più grande rammarico, la nostra sconfitta, è non essere riusciti a intercettare segnali che erano sotto i nostri occhi: in tutto questo tempo, nessuno si è mai confidato con noi". Don Claudio Burgio, cappellano del carcere minorile Beccaria e fondatore delle comunità Kayros, riflette sulle violenze emerse dall’inchiesta della Procura di Milano e rimaste per anni sotto silenzio: "Se leggiamo i testi di tante canzoni trap è tutto scritto, ma noi non siamo stati in grado di ascoltare".
Don Claudio, alla luce degli episodi emersi come andrebbe riformato il sistema del carcere minorile?
"Ho idea che quello del Beccaria non sia un caso isolato e per questo servirebbe una riflessione più ampia, anche sulla formazione e sulla preparazione del personale. C’è un disagio profondo che deriva dall’incapacità degli adulti nel fronteggiare alcune situazioni senza ricorrere alla forza, un problema culturale. I giovani detenuti possono manifestare atteggiamenti aggressivi, gli agenti della polizia penitenziaria lavorano in condizioni difficili ma non si può giustificare la violenza. Conosco tanti agenti che si guadagnano il rispetto dei ragazzi senza l’uso della forza, e da qui bisogna ripartire".
Che clima si respira, ora, al Beccaria?
"Come sempre c’è un clima di tensione, le conflittualità rischiano di esplodere e in questo momento siamo in una fase di riequilibrio, con tutte le difficoltà legate all’inserimento dei nuovi agenti appena arrivati".
In questi anni nessuno, tra i detenuti, si era mai confidato con voi?
"Nessuno ha parlato, altrimenti saremmo intervenuti. Il più grande rammarico mio e di don Gino Rigoldi (predecessore di don Claudio Burgio come cappellano al Beccaria, entrambi sono stati ascoltati dai pm come testimoni, ndr) è di non essere riusciti a conquistare la fiducia. Quando sono in comunità i ragazzi si confidano, ma in carcere la situazione è diversa. Al Beccaria le liti sono frequenti, spesso vedevamo ragazzi con contusioni sul volto. Noi non siamo riusciti a cogliere segnali che erano sotto i nostri occhi, e questo ci ha choccati".
Perché, secondo lei, i ragazzi non si sono confidati?
"A mio parere perché c’è un’abitudine alla violenza, per loro certi comportamenti erano normali. Se leggiamo i testi di tante canzoni trap è tutto scritto, ma noi non siamo stati in grado di ascoltare".
Dopo quello che è successo modificherete, in qualche modo, il vostro intervento?
"Stiamo facendo una riflessione e sicuramente il nostro impegno, anche in termini di tempo, sarà ancora più forte. Ci siamo resi conto che serve una presenza più stabile, un contatto quotidiano e diretto con tutti i detenuti. Noi non arretriamo, ma intensifichiamo gli sforzi".
Quanto hanno pesato i problemi che, al Beccaria, si trascinano da decenni?
"Il carcere è stato lasciato nell’abbandono, anche se questo di certo non giustifica le violenze. Dopo l’evasione del 2022 il ministero ha cercato di intervenire. Da qualche mese c’è finalmente un direttore stabile, Claudio Ferrari, presente tutti i giorni, che sta facendo il massimo sforzo per riorganizzare la struttura. È un punto di partenza per arrivare a un cambiamento, anche se le condizioni restano critiche. Attualmente si contano 80-90 detenuti, una situazione di pesante sovraffollamento che rende il Beccaria una polveriera".

Article: La biografia on line descrive con dovizia di particolari la sua carriera accademica e professionale. La laurea nel 2010 in Architettura d’interni in un notissimo istituto del centro dopo gli studi a Brera e il master nel 2013 in una scuola altrettanto rinomata. E poi le collaborazioni con apprezzati colleghi e le esperienze lavorative come allestitore di mostre, stand espositivi, negozi di orologi, hall di alberghi e ristoranti.
L’operazione-lampo del commissariato Centro, andata in scena nei giorni scorsi, racconta ben altro. Racconta della seconda vita del trentasettenne interior designer incensurato. Sì, perché gli agenti di piazza San Sepolcro hanno arrestato M.B. con l’accusa di detenzione di droga ai fini di spaccio. L’uomo, che mai prima d’ora aveva avuto problemi con la giustizia (se non per una datata segnalazione amministrativa), aveva scelto un luogo quantomeno sui generis per smerciare dosi al riparo da occhi indiscreti: l’abitazione di famiglia in via Lanzone, lì dove vivono ancora la madre settantaquattrenne e la nonna di 104 anni, del tutto ignare di ciò che accadeva nella cameretta.
La vicinanza con l’università Cattolica lo avrebbe reso, secondo le indagini, pusher di fiducia di alcuni studenti dell’ateneo, che salivano all’ultimo piano ed entravano nell’abitazione per rifornirsi. Sulle chat di Telegram e Whatsapp si presentava come "L’Ingegnere", anche se in realtà è laureato in Architettura. L’indagine degli agenti dell’Investigativa, guidati dal dirigente Massimo Cataldi e dal funzionario Alessandro Corbetta, è partita dalla segnalazione dei residenti del condominio, esasperati da quel continuo viavai a qualsiasi ora del giorno.
I poliziotti in borghese si sono appostati lì davanti mercoledì scorso per mappare facce e movimenti. A un certo punto, hanno visto entrare e uscire in pochi minuti due ragazzi di 19 e 20 anni e hanno deciso di fermarli per un controllo: i giovani hanno ammesso di aver appena acquistato due dosi di hashish, indicando anche l’abitazione del venditore. "L’abbiamo preso dall’Ingegnere", hanno detto agli agenti, che li hanno sanzionati in via amministrativa e segnalati in Prefettura come assuntori di stupefacenti.
A quel punto, è scattata la perquisizione: ad aprire la porta è stata la settantaquattrenne, ignara come la madre di 104 anni di quello che combinava il figlio nella stanza accanto. Nella cameretta c’erano il trentasettenne e un diciottenne che stava fumando uno spinello. I controlli hanno portato al sequestro di più di sette etti di marijuana e altrettanti di hashish, di barrette di cioccolata con funghi allucinogeni, di stecche di caramelle piene di hashish, di sigarette elettroniche con resina di cannabis, di tutto l’armamentario per dividere e confezionare le dosi e di quasi 9mila euro in contanti. L’architetto è stato arrestato e mandato in direttissima dal pm di turno Francesca Crupi: il giudice ha convalidato il provvedimento e disposto la misura cautelare dei domiciliari.

Article: Mattarella “Il lavoro non è una merce”
“Il lavoro è legato, in maniera indissolubile, alla persona, alla sua dignità, alla sua dimensione sociale, al contributo che ciascuno può e deve dare alla partecipazione alla vita della società – ha aggiunto il capo dello Stato -. Il lavoro non è una merce. Ha un valore – lo sappiamo – nel mercato dei beni e degli scambi. Anzi, ne è elemento essenziale, perchè senza l’apporto della creatività umana sarebbe privo di consistenza e di qualità. Ma proprio la connessione con la realizzazione della personalità umana conferisce al lavoro un significato ben più grande di un bene economico; lo rende elemento costitutivo del destino comune”.
“Oltre trenta anni addietro qualcuno aveva ipotizzato la “fine della storia”, ampiamente smentito dagli eventi successivi. Oggi si sente parlare di “fine del lavoro” come traguardo di modernità – ha spiegato Mattarella -. In realtà viene, da taluno, ipotizzata, più che la liberazione dalla fatica, la sostituzione dell’imperfezione umana con macchine e tecnologie, sino all’intelligenza artificiale, ritenuta in grado di azzerare ogni errore. In realtà, in quella prospettiva, in quella falsa prospettiva, si configura la rimozione dell’immenso e insostituibile valore della creatività. Uno scenario che raffigura una limitazione alla libertà della persona umana nel suo profilo più affascinante: il suo pensiero, la sua opera. Non un sogno, quindi, ma una prospettiva allarmante e, in realtà, estranea al buon uso dei preziosi benefici recati dai risultati che la scienza consegna all’umanità e, tra questi, quello della cosiddetta intelligenza artificiale, strumento prezioso, naturalmente, in questa direzione e in questa chiave”.
“Il lavoro è libertà. Anzitutto libertà dal bisogno e strumento per esprimere sè stessi, per realizzarsi nella vita – ha sottolineato il capo dello Stato -. Gli straordinari progressi della scienza e della tecnica per migliorare la qualità e la sostenibilità dei prodotti e dei servizi, devono essere sempre indirizzati alla tutela dell’integrità delle persone, dei loro diritti. A partire dal diritto al lavoro”. Quindi “il lavoro deve essere libero da condizionamenti, squilibri e abusi che creano emarginazione e rappresentano il contrario del suo ruolo e del suo significato. Fattori che rappresentano pesanti impedimenti al cammino dell’intera società”, ha proseguito Mattarella.

Article: Buccinasco (Milano) – È stato il capitano , il “bomber“, la bandiera della Polisportiva Buccinasco per 35 anni. Paolo Franchina ha disputato domenica la sua ultima partita, decidendo, dopo una lunga carriera sportiva dedicata al calcio, di appendere le scarpette al chiodo. Conosciutissimo in città, Franchina ha fatto la storia della società, partita quasi 40 anni fa con il nome di Manzoni, poi Euromanzoni, Eurobuccinasco e infine Buccinasco, all’interno della Polisportiva, diretta dal padre di Paolo, Enrico, che, proprio per il suo lunghissimo impegno nel mondo del calcio e in mezzo a bambini e ragazzi, è stato premiato con il Castellum, la benemerenza civica cittadina.
«C’ero con il campo in ghiaia e con il sintetico, quando siamo saliti dalla terza in seconda categoria, quando ci siamo salvati ai play out, a Opera quando abbiamo vinto lo spareggio playoff in 7 contro 11 – ha ripercorso la sua storia calcistica Franchina –. Quando abbiamo vinto il primo storico campionato di seconda e quando ci siamo salvati in prima categoria. Ma c’ero anche quando poi siamo retrocessi. Per il Buccinasco io c’ero, ci sono e ci sarò sempre". L’addio al calcio del 43enne Franchina è stato accompagnato dal tifo di centinaia di tifosi accorsi allo stadio di Buccinasco per salutare il fedelissimo capitano.
Non abbandona la Polisportiva, ormai punto di riferimento per tanti bambini e giovani che possono trovare una realtà impegnata nel trasmettere i valori sani dello sport, togliendo tanti ragazzi dalla strada per offrire loro opportunità di aggregazione e crescita. Continuerà il suo impegno all’interno dell’associazione: "Mi spettano nuove sfide qui. Spero di essere all’altezza", ha detto emozionato il numero 9, che ha giocato oltre mille partite, segnando circa 300 gol.
Franchina ha ringraziato i suoi sostenitori, tutta la società, considerata una vera famiglia, i compagni di squadra e quelli che insieme a lui hanno fatto la storia del Buccinasco, affrontando migliaia di partite in tutti i campi della Lombardia. "Spero che un domani – ha concluso Franchina emozionato – tanti dei bambini che hanno assistito alla mia ultima partita possano diventare bandiere del Buccinasco e vivere, come me, grandissime e indimenticabili emozioni".

Article: “Io provo ancora vergogna. Sono riuscito a denunciare chi mi ha ricattato e ora la questione sta seguendo un iter legale. Però non ho ancora riacquistato serenità". A raccontare la sua storia è Simone, nome di fantasia, ventenne milanese che è stato vittima di sextortion da parte di un uomo nel 2020, "quando avevo 16 anni. In piena pandemia".
Com’è cominciata la storia?
"Era la primavera del 2020, c’era il lockdown e non si poteva uscire di casa. Vivevo incollato a pc e smartphone, che usavo sia per la Dad - anche se non amavo per niente seguire le lezioni a distanza - e sia per lo svago. Ricordo che le ore non passavano mai. Un giorno ho iniziato a chattare con un uomo che avevo visto on line in un sito di incontri per omosessuali, perché mi ero sentito fin da subito molto attratto. Dopo pochissimo tempo ci siamo scambiati i numeri e siamo passati a chattare su WhatsApp. Mi intrigava molto, mi sembrava l’uomo perfetto per me".
Quando è scattato il campanello d’allarme?
"Intanto quando ho scoperto che aveva mentito sulla sua posizione, nella geolocalizzazione del sito d’incontri: aveva indicato di essere residente nell’area milanese e invece si trovava nel Sud Italia, come mi ha confessato in un secondo momento. Ma mi aveva giurato di volersi trasferire al Nord, dopo la pandemia".
E lei gli ha mandato sue foto o video intimi?
"Purtroppo sì. Mi aveva chiesto lui di inviarglieli, e la cosa era reciproca. Solo che poi, anche grazie a un amico, ho scoperto che il materiale che mi inviava lui era completamente “fake“, dato che quelle foto e quei video circolavano già on line: in sostanza aveva fatto un collage, costruendo per me una persona che non esisteva. Invece i miei, purtroppo, erano autentici. All’improvviso è sparito, gettandomi nello sconforto. Io l’ho cercato con insistenza, avevo 16 anni ed ero arrabbiato per essere stato ingannato a quel modo. Mi sentivo sempre peggio, anche perché vedevo che visualizzava i miei messaggi ma non rispondeva mai".
E poi l’ha ricattata?
"Sì. Mi ha mostrato di aver inserito un mio video intimo nella “preview“ di un sito pornografico, dicendomi che avrebbe potuto renderlo pubblico in qualsiasi momento se io non gli avessi mandato dei soldi. Io ho alzato la cresta, rifiutandomi. Ma avevo anche molta paura. E poi ancora mi sentivo, in un certo senso, “sotto il suo potere“. Ha giocato un’altra carta, dicendomi che i soldi gli servivano per trasferirsi al Nord. Così ho ceduto...".
Quanto denaro gli ha inviato? E come se l’è procurato?
"Tramite PayPal, che utilizzavamo per la spesa in famiglia, gli ho inviato una prima volta 100 euro e una seconda 120. Ho fatto in modo che i miei genitori non se ne accorgessero".
A chi e quando ha chiesto aiuto?
"La svolta è stata un incontro, fatto a distanza, a scuola, con la Fondazione Carolina (voluta da Paolo Picchio, il papà della quattordicenne che si tolse la vita a gennaio del 2013 perché vittima di messaggi d’odio suo social, ndr ). Mi sono rivolto agli educatori dell’associazione, che mi hanno accompagnato a sporgere denuncia e aiutato anche a confidarmi con i miei genitori. Non è stato semplice. Nello stesso tempo ho anche preso un cane, perché avevo paura a uscire da solo: nella mia testa mi sentivo sempre in pericolo e osservato".
Un consiglio da dare ai ragazzi?
"L’amore, cercatelo dal vivo".

Article: Milano – Essere Gilberto Govi. Possibile? Sfida eroica. Quasi una provocazione sotto la Lanterna. Ma Tullio Solenghi non si è lasciato intimorire. E così non solo ha riportato in vita “I maneggi per maritare una figlia“, cavallo di battaglia assoluto dello storico attore genovese. Ma in scena quasi non si riconoscono più i tratti dell’ex Trio. Come posseduto dalla maschera del Govi. Bella intuizione. Che da due anni sbanca i botteghini liguri e ora si prova col resto della penisola, da domani a domenica al Carcano. Tutta nel titolo la commedia di Bacigalupo. Con Elisabetta Pozzi al fianco del protagonista, che qui firma anche la regia.
Solenghi, sul palco la somiglianza è straordinaria.
"Sì, temevo l’imitazione e così ho pensato di fare una clonazione... Credo però sia l’unico modo per restituirlo, non solo ai genovesi. Perché Govi funziona a ogni latitudine, due settimane a Roma sono andate benissimo".
Qual è il segreto?
"È un tipo di teatro per cui c’è molta nostalgia. Un teatro che si basa sull’intreccio, sugli attori, sulla mimica, il trucco. Negli ultimi cinquant’anni il palcoscenico è scivolato spesso verso l’autoreferenzialità, spettacoli fatti per amici e colleghi. Il nostro progetto torna a considerare il pubblico e la natura popolare del palcoscenico".
Lei cosa aggiunge alla tradizione?
"C’è un colpo di scena finale che è un po’ il mio marchio di fabbrica. Per il resto ho condiviso il desiderio di riscoprire una foto d’epoca. Non a caso Davide Livermore ha pensato a un allestimento in bianco e nero. Una di quelle immagini che uniscono nostalgia e illuminazione, raccontandoci la nostra storia. Io mi ci sono avvicinato con grande rispetto, salvaguardando il vernacolo. Una riproposizione maniacale, tanto che a Genova gli spettatori si stupiscono quando mi vedono, sembra che Govi sia risorto".
Quanto sta al trucco?
"Adesso un’ora, prima di più. Ma quello che pesa è ripulirsi: mezz’ora di scollamenti dopo lo spettacolo".
Che rapporto ha con il teatro?
"Ci sono cresciuto, è lì che nasco. Poi è arrivato il resto, l’avventura della tv, prima da solo e poi col Trio. Ma è qui il mio dna".
Ha sempre avuto una simpatia per la comicità?
"Quella sicuramente. Pensi che al provino per entrare allo Stabile di Genova portai “A Silvia“ di Leopardi declamata nei vari dialetti italiani, scatenando l’ilarità di Luigi Squarzina. Già allora sfogavo il mio amore per il cabaret e il teatro leggero, appellattivo a dir poco ingeneroso. Mi sono presto specializzato nella risata".
Maestri?
"Squarzina era un professore dalla cultura smisurata. Ma io sono davvero in debito con i grandi attori e le grandi attrici: Alberto Lionello, Tino Buazzelli, Eros Pagni, Lina Volonghi".
Se non ci fosse stato il Trio?
"Avrei comunque fatto l’attore brillante. Ma a teatro mordevo il freno, volevo essere autore di me stesso. Dopo gli spettacoli improvvisavo spesso nel foyer una parodia di quello che avevo appena portato in scena. Sciagurate rivisitazioni, pensate solo per gli amici. L’idea dei Promessi Sposi nasce in quelle nottate".
Idea dal discreto successo.
"Per farlo rifiutammo di condurre Fantastico, la Rai non la prese benissimo. Ma credo che fu la scelta giusta. I Promessi Sposi sono diventati un cult".
La giornata più bella?
"Quando ci telefonò un funzionario per comunicarci i dati di ascolto: avevamo fatto 14 milioni e mezzo di spettatori, ci riusciva solo la nazionale di calcio. E pensare che il progetto era stato un totale azzardo: mai prima di allora ci si era concessi una comicità così continua, per sei puntate di un’ora ciascuna. Di solito le risate venivano intese come brevi parentesi all’interno di contenitori diversi. Fu un momento molto bello".
Avrebbe voluto fare più cinema?
"Forse sì. Mi piaceva il film di Lina Wertmüller “Metalmeccanico e parrucchiera...“. Ma non è un pensiero che mi toglie il sonno".
Qualcosa di cui si pente?
"Anche i mattoni più storti sono stati fondamentali per tirare in piedi l’edificio. Le esperienze negative mi hanno regalato la complessità di questo mestiere, i suoi chiari e i suoi scuri".
Continuerà con Govi?
"Sicuramente. A settembre faremo “Pignasecca e Pignaverde“ e intanto giro anche con Massimo Lopez. D’altronde noi pensionati dobbiamo pur trovare il modo di riempire le giornate".

Article: Tajani “Giusto candidarsi a Europee, metto a servizio la mia esperienza”
Lo ha detto il vicepremier e segretario nazionale di Forza Italia, Antonio Tajani, intervenuto a Cartabianca su Rete4. “Servono riforme come l’elezione diretta del presidente della Commissione Europea e una riforma che porti poi ad avere una difesa europea. Io voglio far parlare delle cose concrete, compresa la salute. Se eletto non andro perchè sceglierò l’Italia? Essendo Ministro degli Esteri la mia presenza sarà comunque costante”. Sulla candidatura con la Lega del Generale Roberto Vannacci; “Se avessi condiviso le sue idee gli avrei chiesto di candidarsi per Forza Italia. Non mi piace quello che dice, un militare deve fare il militare, non può quando è in servizio prendere una posizione politica. Candidarsi va bene, ma poi non può piu tornare indietro, è una questione di principio”. Sulla candidatura di Ilaria Salis con Avs: “C’è un processo, mi auguro che venga assolta perchè sono un garantista, l’abbiamo seguita per la sua vicenda, per l’assistenza in carcere, abbiamo protestato per il trattamento che ha ricevuto. La candidatura è una sua libera scelta, io credo che politicizzare il caso non convenga, ma siamo in democrazia”.

Article: Milano – «Non mi sento messo da parte. Avevo offerte non solo da Forza Italia, ma anche da altri partiti. Ho scelto io di non candidarmi per seguire due progetti ai quali tengo molto". Roberto Formigoni, 77 anni, non correrà alle Europee, né in Forza Italia né con altre formazioni. Durante la legislatura che partirà dopo le elezioni dell’8 e 9 giugno, vedremo l’ex quattro volte presidente della Lombardia – che ha finito di scontare la condanna definitiva a quasi sei anni nel novembre dell’anno scorso – nell’inedita veste di sceneggiatore per un docufilm su Milano e, forse, di insegnante per nuovi politici.
Formigoni, com’è andata davvero con Forza Italia?
"Fino a due mesi fa c’era la possibilità che mi candidassi, poi è arrivata questa proposta di partecipare a un grande progetto cinematografico su Milano. Un docufilm che mi vedrà impegnato come sceneggiatore insieme a un team di grossi nomi per raccontare la straordinaria trasformazione di cui Milano è stata protagonista in questi anni. Parleranno i politici di tutti gli schieramenti, ma anche gli architetti che sono dietro alla nuova faccia della città, gli imprenditori che hanno investito miliardi, e i cittadini che qui vivono quotidianamente".
Insomma, si dà al cinema?
"Non solo. L’altro grande progetto a cui sto lavorando è quello di una scuola di formazione politica per i giovani. Perché se c’è una cosa di cui ha bisogno la politica oggi è proprio una nuova classe dirigente preparata. In questi anni tante volte mi sono trovato a parlare di politica coi giovani e ho tenuto lezioni informali, mettendo a disposizione la mia esperienza. Ecco, vorrei trasformare tutto questo in una vera scuola di formazione. Del resto, una volta la Dc poteva contare sugli oratori e i circoli, dove i ragazzi si formavano e discutevano di politica. Ora questi luoghi non esistono più e la qualità dei nostri politici ne risente. Adesso i candidati si scelgono per la fedeltà al leader di turno".
Parla di Dc, oratori, circoli, reperti di un’altra epoca, non si sente un po’ fuori dal tempo?
"Assolutamente no. E non solo perché i partiti continuano a cercarmi. Lo vedo quando cammino per strada: le persone mi fermano, mi chiedono di tornare, i ragazzi – che di certo non c’erano quando ero presidente della Regione – mi chiedono di fare una foto, mi incoraggiano".
Ora le campagne elettorali si fanno soprattutto sui social. Sarebbe pronto a sostenerne una a colpi di post su Instagram?
"Io preferisco ancora il contatto diretto con le persone, ma ho fatto dodici campagne elettorali, sempre con un certo successo. Penso proprio di sapere come si facciano. Sui i social ora non ci sono ma ci sono stato. Sono convinto che ci si debba stare sempre con un atteggiamento critico, perché il rischio di condizionamento del pensiero è altissimo. Anche per questo credo si debbano educare i giovani al dialogo e alla politica vera".
La vedremo ancora in politica o questa era l’ultima occasione?
"Non ho rinunciato alla politica attiva. Ora ho questi due progetti ai quali mi voglio dedicare e che penso possano essere utili alla collettività esattamente come dovrebbe essere la buona politica. Per quanto riguarda una mia candidatura aspetterò il prossimo appuntamento: le elezioni politiche nel 2027".

Article: Via libera al decreto Coesione, Fitto “Obiettivo mettere in moto 74 mld”
“Abbiamo voluto creare le condizioni per avviare una riforma importante. Nella programmazione 2021-2027 gli impegni e le spese sono quasi pari a zero quindi l’obiettivo è rimettere in moto in modo concreto, coerente e concordato con gli altri programmi risorse con importo pari a 43 miliardi euro di risorse europee a cui si aggiungono risorse di cofinanziamento nazionali e regionali per un importo complessivo di 74 miliardi da spendere nella programmazione 2021-2027 da utilizzare per le prime due annualità, pari al 20% di ognuno singoli programmi, entro il 31 dicembre 2025”, ha detto Raffaele Fitto, ministro per gli Affari europei, il Sud, le politiche di Coesione e il Pnrr, in conferenza stampa al termine della riunione del Consiglio dei ministri.
“Abbiamo finanziato per 1,2 miliardi la bonifica e il recupero dell’area di Bagnoli a Napoli – ha spiegato -. E’ un finanziamento rilevantissimo che ha una valenza non solamente ambientale ma anche e soprattutto sociale, economica e di prospettiva in quel territorio, che rappresenta un segnale molto importante, che mette in moto la quota del Fondo di sviluppo e coesione assegnata a quel territorio e che consentirà, anche in sinergia con tutti i componenti della cabina di regia, di poter avviare questi interventi”.
Il provvedimento è volto a realizzare la riforma della politica di coesione che è stata inserita nell’ambito della revisione del Piano nazionale di ripresa e resilienza (PNRR) al fine di conferire unitarietà strategica e visione comune alle principali leve di sviluppo e coesione e di accelerare e rafforzare l’attuazione degli interventi finanziati dalla politica di coesione 2021-2027, mirati a ridurre i divari territoriali, in particolare nei settori delle risorse idriche, delle infrastrutture per il rischio idrogeologico e la protezione dell’ambiente, dei rifiuti, dei trasporti e della mobilità sostenibile, dell’energia, del sostegno allo sviluppo e all’attrattività delle imprese, anche per le transizioni digitale e verde.
I programmi di investimento interessati – spiega Palazzo Chigi nel comunicato diffuso dopo il Cdm – sono finanziati da 42 miliardi di euro di risorse europee e 32 miliardi di euro di risorse nazionali per il solo ciclo di programmazione 2021-2027, dunque 74 miliardi di euro di investimenti destinati a ridurre i divari territoriali.
Con la riforma, si assicura il coordinamento tra gli interventi dalla politica di coesione attuati a livello regionale e quelli attuati a livello nazionale, promuovendo la complementarietà e la sinergia tra gli interventi della politica di coesione europea e gli investimenti previsti dagli Accordi per la coesione e dal PNRR.
Si introduce il bonus giovani, che consiste nell’esonero dal 100% dei contributi previdenziali a carico dei datori di lavoro – nel limite massimo di 500 euro mensili – per 2 anni, per l’assunzione di giovani con età inferiore a 35 anni, donne e, nelle Regioni della Zona Economica Speciale unica del Mezzogiorno, anche degli over 35 disoccupati da almeno ventiquattro mesi.

Article: Usmate Velate (Monza) – Primi due interrogatori di garanzia in carcere ieri all’indomani degli arresti per la presunta corruzione sull’urbanistica in municipio che vede al centro il responsabile del settore Territorio e Ambiente del Comune Antonio Colombo.
Il geometra 53enne residente a Vedano al Lambro è stato sentito dalla giudice per le indagini preliminari del Tribunale di Monza Angela Colella, che ha firmato le nove ordinanze di custodia cautelare chieste dal pm monzese Carlo Cinque ed eseguite dai finanzieri del Comando provinciale di Monza.
Colombo , accusato di avere intascato in un paio di anni circa 200mila euro per pratiche edilizie ritenute oggetto di corruzione "per atti contrari ai doveri d’ufficio" e difeso dagli avvocati Raffaele Della Valle e Donatella Rapetti, si è difeso negando le accuse e ha sostenuto che le somme ricevute sono pagamenti per lavori svolti come libero professionista o come mediatore e che nulla hanno a che vedere con l’attività di funzionario pubblico come capo dell’ufficio tecnico. La difesa del geometra ha chiesto che il 53enne venga scarcerato e ottenga gli arresti domiciliari.
Interrogato dalla gip anche l’imprenditore dei laterizi Galdino Magni, 69 anni, residente a Vimercate, finito anche lui dietro le sbarre. "Ha sostenuto di avere pagato Antonio Colombo per una compravendita immobiliare che gli ha gestito lui – spiega il difensore di Magni, l’avvocato Luca Ricci – e che i 30 e 35mila euro riguardano una provvigione su una mediazione per avergli presentato Alberto Riva che ha acquistato un immobile del Comune di Usmate Velate aggiudicato ad un’asta e una parcella per un primo studio di fattibilità. Non è la casa oggetto della denuncia che ha fatto scattare le indagini, presentata dalla coppia di avvocati con cui c’è in corso una causa".
La difesa dell’imprenditore nega anche l’accusa di avere ottenuto grazie a Colombo un alto indice di edificabilità. "Era solo una possibilità teorica – conclude il legale – Nessun atto contrario ai doveri d’ufficio, nè scorrettezza o illegittimità. La pratica non era seguita da Colombo ma era affidata ad un suo collega". Galdino Magni ha anche scagionato il fratello Donato, 67 anni, che è finito agli arresti domiciliari e che verrà interrogato a partire da domani, sostenendo che il fratello è amministratore della società ma non la gestisce di fatto. L’avvocato Ricci non ha presentato per intanto richiesta di scarcerazione e si riserva di fissare un interrogatorio con il pm.
Il terzo destinatario della misura di custodia cautelare in carcere, Alberto Riva, 65 anni, figlio dell’ex sindaco di Vimercate Ezio Riva, non è stato trovato dai finanzieri perché si trova in Sudamerica e ha promesso di tornare in Italia.
Sempre da domani sono previsti il suo interrogatorio di garanzia e anche quelli degli altri indagati agli arresti domiciliari: l’ex “geometra di Berlusconi“ Francesco Calogero Magnano, 75enne residente a Macherio; la compagna di Colombo, Annabella Beretta, 54 anni, che risulta residente a Capoliveri in provincia di Livorno ma di fatto vive con Colombo a Vedano al Lambro; il fratello Giovanni Carlo Beretta, 58 anni, residente a Lesmo e gli imprenditori Donato Magni, Ancilla Antonella Giuseppina Cantù, 58 anni e Luigi Roncalli, 51 anni. Le accuse, oltre che di concorso in corruzione, sono anche di emissione di fatture per operazioni inesistenti e frode fiscale.
Secondo l’accusa Antonio Colombo ha inserito nella variante del nuovo Piano di governo del territorio, adottata dal Consiglio comunale, alcune aree rese oggetto di variazione di destinazione urbanistica, da agricola a produttiva ed edificabile, con un evidente aumento del loro valore economico. Tra queste anche addirittura alcune aree interessate in parte da vincoli per la Pedemontana, per cui risulta indagato anche il geometra Magnano.

Article: Vigevano (Pavia) – Il decano dei primari dell’ospedale di Vigevano, il dottor Fabrizio Malvezzi che guida da diciannove anni la Struttura complessa di Oculistica, ha deciso di andare in pensione in anticipo di quasi un anno rispetto ai tempi previsti.
Il primario vedrà scadere l’incarico dal 1° agosto ma di fatto cesserà la propria attività professionale a giugno, quando inizierà a smaltire le ferie arretrate. Si tratta del primario con maggiore anzianità all’ospedale di Vigevano, visto che il suo primo incarico risale al 1° febbraio 2005 e Malvezzi è oggi al quarto incarico quinquennale consecutivo. In realtà l’ultimo mandato risaliva al gennaio 2020 con scadenza a giugno di quest’anno quando, al compimento del 67esimo anno, il dottor Malvezzi avrebbe potuto essere collocato in pensione. Prima di quella data però aveva chiesto e ottenuto, come prevede la legge, di restare in servizio sino ai 70 anni, quindi sino al giugno del prossimo anno.
Ora però ha optato per l’uscita anticipata. "È arrivato il momento di smettere – spiega Malvezzi – perché l’età inizia a farsi sentire e anche per i problemi legati alla scarsità del personale. Siamo rimasti in pochi ed è difficile trovare nuovi specialisti da assumere con carichi di lavoro in continuo aumento".
Quello del primario di Oculistica però non sarà un addio definitivo alla professione, che continuerà ad esercitare da libero professionista nello studio di Pavia. Il reparto di Oculistica era stato trasferito in via provvisoria a Mortara negli anni del Covid, per lasciare a disposizione del nosocomio cittadino spazi per il ricovero dei pazienti. Poi con il tempo lo spostamento è diventato definitivo. A Mortara Oculistica dispone di due sale operatorie per gli interventi di cataratta che sono programmati con cadenza quotidiana mentre a Vigevano, per un solo giorno ogni due settimane, si effettuano interventi di chirurgia a carico della retina.
Quanto agli organici carenti ci sono quattro posti a tempo indeterminato da coprire per fisioterapisti all’Asst. I candidati sono 59. Scade invece domani il termine per l’iscrizione al concorso per l’assunzione di 15 infermieri, il quarto nell’arco di pochi mesi ma ne è già stato indetto uno ulteriore, per altri sei posti, con scadenza il 13 maggio. Nel caso specifico però il personale sarà tutto destinato all’ospedale di Varzi.

Article: Il presidente della Lega Serie A Lorenzo Casini ha parlato a Radio Anch'io lo Sport su Radio Rai 1: "La riforma dei campionati è sempre sul tavolo. Da circa vent'anni la Serie A ha sempre lo stesso numero di partite. Adesso sono aumentate le partite di Supercoppa, ma parliamo di una-due gare. Quelle che sono aumentate in maniera esponenziale sono le competizioni internazionali, sia di club sia di nazionale. Chiediamo alla Fifa una maggiore consultazione nella definizione dei calendari".
La Supercoppa può tornare a gara unica a inizio stagione?
"È una decisione che hanno preso le squadre a larghissima maggioranza. Quello a 4 è un format che la Spagna ha introdotto e che l'Italia ha seguito. Il problema del calendario è che quando la Serie A va a compilarlo, ci sono dei binari già scritti dalle finestre internazionali Fifa e Uefa".
La tensione tra Uefa e Fifa?
"Questa tensione ha raggiunto un punto di non ritorno legato al numero delle partite. C'è un tema di giocatori che non hanno mai un momento di riposo. E poi c'è un tema economico: nel momento in cui c'è un giocatore che gioca vince un terzo delle partite con le nazionali ma è contrattualizzato da un club, ecco che diventa un argomento che non va sottovalutato".
Rapporti turbolenti tra FIGC e Lega, qual è la maggiore distanza tra voi e la Federazione?
"La maggiore distanza è che nel piano strategico della Federazione mancano alcuni temi che per la Serie A sono molto importanti per riformare davvero il calcio italiano: una maggiore autonomia della Lega Serie A sul modello inglese, una maggiore autonomia e indipendenza del sistema arbitrale, una giustizia sportiva ancora più efficiente e indipendente e l'istituzione di organismi di controllo finanziario realmente indipendenti".
Quando Gravina parla di 'Lotitismo', cosa pensa?
"Credo sia una personalizzazione che non serve al calcio italiano".
Un pensiero sul tema del razzismo?
"La Serie A è da sempre impegnata contro la piaga del razzismo. Ancora c'è, ma c'è meno anche grazie a molte iniziative di squadre e calciatori. Non ci stancheremo mai di dire che bisogna partire dalla scuola, è lì che inizia il percorso formativo".
Troppi stranieri in Serie A?
"Sugli extracomunitari bisogna sfatare un mito: attualmente la Serie A è la lega col numero più basso di nuovi arrivi. Un altro tema è rappresentato dagli effetti della sentenza Bosman. L'impatto è stato devastante rispetto a quello che poteva essere l'investimento sui vivai. Per fortuna la Serie A ha lavorato moltissimo sui campionati Primavera, per favorire una presenza massiccia o minima di giocatori convocabili italiani".

Article: Vigevano (Pavia) – Le Suore Maddalene non devono lasciare Vigevano. E la città è disposta a fare qualunque cosa per ottenere il risultato. Anche a scrivere a Papa Francesco. Lo ha fatto ieri il sindaco Andrea Ceffa, che ha affidato al Pontefice il pensiero di un’intera città avanzando una richiesta che "arriva direttamente dal cuore dei tantissimi cittadini che ho l’onore di rappresentare e dei quali mi faccio portavoce, condividendola, sia come cittadino che come credente". Con queste parole il primo cittadino ducale si rivolge al Santo Padre per trasmettergli il sentimento di tutta la comunità vigevanese che, alla notizia della chiusura del convento, ha risposto con una petizione che ha già raccolto oltre duemila firme.
«Poco più di un mese fa – scrive Ceffa a Papa Francesco – abbiamo appreso con stupore, incredulità e dolore, la notizia della chiusura della Casa delle Suore Maddalene Figlie di Gesù Buon Pastore di Vigevano per decisione della Casa Generalizia di Piacenza e del Padre Commissario Gianfranco Lunardon di Roma. Questa lettera è tesa a chiedere il suo intervento affinché le suore non lascino il convento".
Una richiesta avallata dal fatto che esse stesse, in più occasioni, hanno manifestato la volontà di "continuare la loro missione presso la nostra comunità che le ha sempre considerate un punto di riferimento, così come lo vogliono migliaia di cittadini che stanno sottoscrivendo la petizione a Lei indirizzata e di cui sono il primo firmatario".
Ora la parola passa al Santo Padre. Se non ci saranno interventi dal Vaticano a fine giugno, come prevede il documento firmato l’8 marzo dalla Casa Generalizia di Piacenza, le Suore lasceranno Vigevano dopo oltre 145 anni.
L’intenzione della Madre Generale sembra irrevocabile ed è stata ribadita anche nel corso dell’incontro che ha avuto pochi giorni fa con il vescovo di Vigevano, Maurizio Gervasoni. Ecco perché solo dal vertice della Chiesa può arrivare una decisione contraria. Ora, con soli due mesi a disposizione, il sindaco Ceffa ha deciso di rivolgersi direttamente al Sommo Pontefice.

Article: C’era anche il vescovo di Caltanissetta Mons. Mario Russotto da Papa Francesco. L’occasione la visita ad Limina Apostolorum che ha coinvolto tutti i vescovi delle diocesi siciliane che rimarranno nella Capitale fino al 3 maggio. La visita sarà l’occasione, per i prelati, di presentare relazioni dettagliate dell’attività diocesana alla Curia Romana, illustrando il cammino in atto e i progetti per i prossimi anni.
Immigrazione, accoglienza, denatalità. Questioni molto care al Papa, affrontate con i vescovi della Sicilia in visita ad Limina. Tra gli altri temi affrontati, questioni di grande attualità e impatto sociale, come le problematiche che affliggono la vita pastorale delle singole diocesi e i problemi della mancanza di legalità e della mafia. Si è parlato del sostegno ai giovani nella fede e della tendenza da parte loro a lasciare l’isola: “Abbiamo parlato dei problemi dello spopolamento, perché dalla nostra isola si va via, purtroppo”, ha dichiarato monsignor Antonino Raspanti, vescovo di Acireale e presidente della conferenza episcopale siciliana, a Radio Vaticana – Vatican News, davanti a una Piazza San Pietro riscaldata da un intenso sole primaverile, quasi a omaggiare i vescovi isolani.
Visita cordiale e familiare
“L’incontro con Papa Francesco”, che si è svolto in un clima “molto cordiale e familiare”, ha detto monsignor Raspanti, “ha offerto ai vescovi l’opportunità di discutere in modo vero e profondo delle sfide pastorali, delle opportunità e delle criticità che affliggono la nostra bella isola”. Un incontro “molto lungo” nel quale tutti i vescovi hanno potuto esprimersi, messi subito a loro agio da Francesco che, non solo ha ascoltato, ma ha voluto “che tutti prendessero la parola e raccontassero la vita delle loro diocesi”.
Speranze e progetti futuri
“L’impressione che abbiamo avuto tutti uscendo – ha proseguito il vescovo siciliano – è stato di un vero e fraterno incontro con colui che ci guida ed è assegnato dalla Provvidenza a guidare la Chiesa universale”. Un incontro proficuo nel quale si è parlato di progetti futuri e di soluzioni concrete che possano aiutare a “trasmettere ai giovani i contenuti della fede”, di come rendere ancora più efficaci le visite pastorali e come si possa far fronte a tutte le difficoltà con “spirito di comunione” e con il “cammino sinodale”. Queste visite ad Limina, ha concluso, sono importanti anche per il rafforzamento della missione della Chiesa in Sicilia. L’udienza si è conclusa alle ore 12 circa e i vescovi hanno recitato assieme al Papa la preghiera del Regina Caeli.

Article: Caiolo (Sondrio) – L’orso è tornato a fare capolino a Caiolo, nei boschi sopra il paese, probabilmente dopo essersi risvegliato dal lungo letargo invernale, che deve avergli messo una gran fame e voglia di miele, dato che la prima predazione del plantigrado, come comunicato sui social dal Comune di Caiolo, è ai danni di un’arnia. La comunicazione è breve e dice: "Si comunica che è stata confermata, da parte delle guardie provinciali, la predazione da parte di un orso di un apiario in località Bricioli sopra Caiolo. Prestate attenzione".
È il terzo anno consecutivo che viene rilevata la presenza dell’orso a Caiolo. Negli anni scorsi l’orso, che pare essere ghiotto di dolci e frutta, è stato addirittura ripreso da un video mentre si cibava di mirtilli in località Costa, a un’altitudine di 1400 metri, sui monti tra Albosaggia e Caiolo. Quell’avvistamento ha suscitato notevole preoccupazione, spingendo i vertici del Comune a parlare pubblicamente della la situazione.
"È noto che diversi orsi e altri grandi predatori si muovono sulle nostre montagne, ma spesso si tende a tenere queste informazioni nascoste per non allarmare la popolazione. La nostra valle è considerata una zona di espansione dei grandi predatori, a causa della gestione non adeguata del progetto orsi in Trentino, dove gli esemplari sono stati introdotti", avevano dichiarato Graziano Murada e Primavera Farina (sindaci di Albosaggia e Caiolo).
Lo scorso anno ci sono stati due avvistamenti: il primo vicino alla Valle del Livrio, a un’altitudine di 700 metri, e il secondo segnalato da una famiglia nei pressi del lago della Casera. Gli avvistamenti dell’orso a Caiolo stanno dunque richiamando l’attenzione sul tema della gestione della presenza dei grandi predatori sul territorio. Il Comune, insieme alle autorità provinciali, sta monitorando attentamente la situazione e invitando i residenti a prestare attenzione e adottare le precauzioni necessarie. Non distante, in Valcamonica, si verificano avvistamenti che potrebbero essere degli stessi orsi che di muovono in Valtellina, dato che i selvatici sono in grado di spostarsi anche di 40 chilometri al giorno e quelle che a fondovalle appaiono lunghe distanze, in quota sono invece relativamente brevi. Ciò consente agli orsi di aggirarsi tra Valtellina, Bresciano e Trentino.

Article: “Solo Salvini non si è candidato. Per me è giusto farlo, perchè è il primo appuntamento elettorale senza il nostro leader e poi sono il politico che ha piu esperienza nel Parlamento Europeo e credo di poter dare un contributo mettendola sul tavolo”.
Lo ha detto il vicepremier e segretario nazionale di Forza Italia, Antonio Tajani, intervenuto a Cartabianca su Rete4. “Servono riforme come l’elezione diretta del presidente della Commissione Europea e una riforma che porti poi ad avere una difesa europea. Io voglio far parlare delle cose concrete, compresa la salute. Se eletto non andro perchè sceglierò l’Italia? Essendo Ministro degli Esteri la mia presenza sarà comunque costante”. Sulla candidatura con la Lega del Generale Roberto Vannacci; “Se avessi condiviso le sue idee gli avrei chiesto di candidarsi per Forza Italia. Non mi piace quello che dice, un militare deve fare il militare, non può quando è in servizio prendere una posizione politica. Candidarsi va bene, ma poi non può piu tornare indietro, è una questione di principio”. Sulla candidatura di Ilaria Salis con Avs: “C’è un processo, mi auguro che venga assolta perchè sono un garantista, l’abbiamo seguita per la sua vicenda, per l’assistenza in carcere, abbiamo protestato per il trattamento che ha ricevuto. La candidatura è una sua libera scelta, io credo che politicizzare il caso non convenga, ma siamo in democrazia”.

Article: Busto Arsizio (Varese) – Al momento è sospesa la protesta a Busto Arsizio dei genitori contro il "caro mensa", l’aumento del costo del pasto giornaliero, da 5,80 euro a 6,30 euro che scatterà il prossimo anno scolastico.
La decisione è stata presa dopo l’incontro, avvenuto il 23 aprile, con il sindaco Emanuele Antonelli e l’assessore alla Politiche educative Daniela Cerana che hanno espresso l’impegno ad intervenire con alcune soluzioni che saranno oggetto di un nuovo confronto con le famiglie nel mese di luglio. Genitori dunque invitati ad avere pazienza ancora qualche mese ma non sono affatto tranquilli.
Lunedì sera i rappresentanti dei genitori delle scuole primarie alle prese con il rincaro del servizio mensa si sono ritrovati per fare il punto della situazione e decidere eventuali azioni da promuovere per mantenere alta l’attenzione sulla vicenda.
La mobilitazione è cominciata il 15 aprile, quando la maggior parte dei genitori degli alunni della scuola elementare nel rione Sant’Anna ha disdetto il pranzo riportando a casa i figli per il pasto poi riaccompagnati per le lezioni del pomeriggio.
La protesta si è subito estesa con un’elevata adesione alla scuola Rossi nel rione di Borsano e poi alla scuola Bertacchi, nel quartiere di Sant’Edoardo. Protesta quindi rientrata in vista della riunione, convocata il 23 aprile scorso, con il sindaco Antonelli e l’assessore Cerana, conclusa con l’impegno a un nuovo incontro tra le parti, con le soluzioni sul tavolo, nel mese di luglio.
Nel frattempo lo "sciopero della mensa" è stato sospeso in attesa di conoscere le risposte da parte dell’amministrazione comunale che sta valutando alcune soluzioni, tenendo conto delle richieste dei genitori, come una diversa suddivisione delle fasce Isee, più scaglionate rispetto a quella attuale e la reintroduzione dello sconto del 50% per il secondo figlio iscritto al servizio mensa, cancellato dal prossimo anno scolastico.
La preoccupazione tra le famiglie, finchè dall’amministrazione non arriveranno risposte chiare, resta dunque alta, l’aumento del costo del pasto giornaliero per singolo figlio si annuncia come un vero e proprio salasso per i bilanci familiari. Spiega un genitore:"l’incremento è eccessivo, per una famiglia con due figli l’aumento sarà di 799, 50 euro all’anno, per chi ha tre figli iscritti alla mensa di 1.445, 25, ancora più pesante la situazione per chi ha 4 figli, 1.773,25 euro in più rispetto ad oggi. Non è accettabile". E per questo da parte delle famiglie è stata avanzata la richiesta di poter portare il pasto da casa, come succede in tre scuole in Brianza, ma a quanto pare proposta non facilmente attuabile.

Article: Mostra mercato di giardinaggio e florovivaismo tra le più importanti del Centro Italia – Ricco programma per amanti di fiori e piante e per bambini, ancora mercoledì 1 maggio
È sbocciata a Sant’Anatolia di Narco Primavera in Valnerina. La XVII edizione della mostra mercato del giardinaggio e del florovivaismo, tra le più importanti del settore nel Centro Italia, è infatti in scena martedì 30 aprile e mercoledì 1 maggio nella spettacolare cornice dell’Abbazia dei Santi Felice e Mauro. Punto di riferimento di espositori specializzati e qualificati che di anno in anno rinnovano la loro presenza all’evento, la mostra mercato propone piante insolite, officinali, pelargoni, peonie, rose, orchidee, camelie, fruttiferi, ortive, piante rare e zafferano, ma anche ceramiche artistiche, arredamento da giardino e gioielli con fiori. Accanto, un ricco programma di attività per gli amanti di fiori e piante e un cartellone di iniziative, ‘Primavera for kids’, pensato per i bambini.
“Primavera in Valnerina – ha commentato Arianna Giovannini coordinatrice dell’evento – è diventata un’eccellenza di questo territorio e accoglie quest’anno circa 60 espositori che hanno attraversato l’Italia dal Nord al Sud, comprese Sicilia e Sardegna, per venire da noi in questa due giorni e portando con sé anche piante e fiori particolari e rari. Il programma è molto ricco di appuntamenti”.
Primavera in Valnerina, evento organizzato con il contributo del Gal Valle umbra e Sibillini, ha infatti proposto nella prima giornata due laboratori, uno di ortoterapia riservato agli alunni delle scuole e uno botanico con materiali di riciclo organizzato con l’Associazione nazionale famiglie di persone con disabilità intellettiva e/o relazionale, oltre che un’iniziativa di celebrazione del rispetto dei bambini e tutela dei diritti della bambina, a cura di Fidapa Bpw Italy – Sezione Valnerina. In entrambi i giorni alle 15.30 si può, poi, partecipare a ‘Pillole di coltivazione domestica’ per la cura delle orchidee con Orchidofili umbri. Mercoledì primo maggio, invece, sono in programma alle 9.45 la passeggiata di riconoscimento di ‘Erbe e piante di fiume commestibili’ e la realizzazione dell’herbarium (su prenotazione 349.5245022); alle 10 le dimostrazioni gratuite di tiro con l’arco ‘Arciere per un giorno’ a cura di Asd Arcieri del Grifo e alle 11 ‘Di fiori e di poesie’, rubrica informativa culturale e reading poetico in collaborazione con Fidapa Bpw Italy Sezione Valnerina, Borghi della Lettura e Borghi più belli d’Italia – Umbria. Alle 15, l’arte giapponese del Kokedama sarà spiegata e realizzata dagli studenti dell’Istituto tecnico agrario di Sant’Anatolia di Narco. StraVerde proporrà due attività: alle 16.30 Un orto 100% ecosostenibile anche per neofiti ortolani che permetterà nuove esperienze usando sani principi del passato in chiave moderna, alle 18 rimedi e strategie per un giardino sostenibile a zero consumo idrico, bassissima manutenzione con fiori e pieno di vita con rimedi naturali.

Article: E’ possibile aggiungere tanto al tag <style> che al tag <link>. L’attributo in questione è media ed il suo compito è quello di definire il supporto cui applicare le regole contenuto nel foglio di stile. In pratica, attraverso l’attributo media, è possibile importare nella pagina più fogli di stile da utilizzare alternativamente a seconda del dispositivo di fruizione del contenuto utilizzato dall’utente.
Volendo fare un esempio pratico, sarà possibile definire un CSS apposito per la visualizzazione del contenuto sul monitor di un computer, uno per i dispositivi mobili, uno per la stampa del documento, ecc. Vediamo qualche esempio:
<link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="stampa.css"> <style type="text/css" media="handheld"> ... </style>
E’ importante dire che l’attributo media è facoltativo, in mancanza il browser gli assegnerà il valore di default “all” il che significa che le regole CSS definite nel foglio di stile verranno applicate a tutti i dispositivi.
Vediamo di seguito i possibili valori che può assumere l’attributo media:
- all – ogni dispositivo;
- braille – dispositivi basati su braille;
- embossed – stampanti braille;
- handheld – dispositivi portatili con display piccolo (ad esempio palmari o telefoni cellulari);
- print – stampanti;
- projection – presentazioni e proiezioni;
- screen – schermo del computer;
- speech – dispositivi di sintesi vocale;
- tty – terminali;
- tv – televisori.
Volendo è possibile assegnare divseri media allo stesso foglio di stile, per farlo si crea un elenco di voci separate da una virgola:
Da un punto di vista prettamente pratico l’utilizzo dell’attributo media assume una certa importanza soprattutto per la definizione di regole. Nella normalità dei casi, infatti, l’attributo in oggetto viene omesso oppure utilizzato limitatamente ai valori “screen” e “print”.
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen, print" href="style.css"

Article: WP-Automatic, consente agli hacker di eseguire iniezioni SQL, che permettono di ottenere un accesso non autorizzato e il pieno controllo dei siti web, queste sono le voci di corridoio sui post del web che dicono.
WP-Automatic è stato progettato per automatizzare l’importazione e la pubblicazione di contenuti da varie fonti, come feed RSS, siti web e canali YouTube. È molto diffuso tra gli utenti di WordPress, ma le versioni vulnerabili del plugin precedenti alla 3.9.2.0 sono esposte agli attacchi.
Secondo WPScan, ci sono stati più di cinque milioni di tentativi di sfruttare questa vulnerabilità. Gli hacker stanno già sfruttando questa falla per creare nuovi account di amministratore sui siti web e portare a termine ulteriori attacchi, come l’installazione di applicazioni dannose e l’ottenimento di informazioni sensibili.
Ora c’è il rischio di un accesso a lungo termine ai siti web da parte degli aggressori, che può portare a backdoor e offuscamento del codice, rendendo difficile per i proprietari dei siti web o gli strumenti di sicurezza rilevare il problema.
I ricercatori notano inoltre che gli hacker possono rinominare i file dei plugin vulnerabili per rendere più difficile l’individuazione del problema e impedire ad altri aggressori di prendere il controllo.
Si consiglia agli utenti di installare solo i temi e i plugin che intendono utilizzare e di tenerli aggiornati per proteggere i propri siti web da possibili attacchi.

2024-04-30 22:31:00 Arrivano conferme da Tuttosport:
I motivi per divorziare
1. Sensazioni da fine ciclo
Il girone di ritorno è stato disastroso e si è caricato di peso psicoemotivo, con una squadra sempre più nervosa, spaventata, spaesata. Quanto ha ancora presa sui giocatori? Nessuno gli gioca contro, anzi è apprezzato dalla rosa per come difende sempre i giocatori, ma sembra quasi non riesca più a trasmettere qualcosa alla squadra. E le critiche, continue e martellanti, che riceve possono inconsciamente influire sulla squadra, quasi deresponsabilizzata dal fatto che alla fine è sempre colpa di
Allegri. Si respira aria da fine ciclo, da divorzio che farebbe bene sia alla Juventus che al tecnico. Sono grandi i rischi di un’altra stagione di transizione, di caccia al quarto posto giocando male e senza una visione sul futuro.
2. La proposta di gioco
Pochi gol e una ...

Article: CUPRA, il brand contemporaneo e non convenzionale ha svelato le nuove CUPRA Formentor e Leon, ridisegnate e migliorate per continuare la storia di successo.
La nuova CUPRA Formentor arriva per consolidare il successo della prima versione del SUV coupé. Diventato il modello bestseller del brand, sta per diventarne anche l’icona. Grazie alle oltre 120.000 unità consegnate in tutto il mondo (+23% rispetto al 2022), CUPRA Formentor, lo scorso anno, ha conquistato la cima delle classifiche.
Il nuovo design esterno include il logo CUPRA integrato sul cofano, l’audace frontale shark nose che enfatizza il look dinamico, i fari matrix a LED con firma luminosa triangolare e la grande griglia. Lo stesso design delle luci triangolari viene ripreso nel posteriore che sfoggia al centro il logo CUPRA integrato e illuminato. I nuovi colori opachi Century Bronze ed Enceladus Grey donano ancora più carattere ai due modelli. La stessa emozione pura del design esterno si riflette nell’abitacolo, contraddistinto dal connubio di sportività e sostenibilità con tecnologie digitali e scelta di materiali.
Gli interni regalano una sensazione di qualità superiore, grazie a elementi di nuova concezione come la console centrale. L’abitacolo è inoltre arricchito con nuovi materiali, adottando un approccio più sostenibile, tra cui i sedili avvolgenti avvolti in microfibra riciclata al 73% o pelle rispettosa dell’ambiente.
La digitalizzazione è al centro dell’attenzione del conducente. Una nuova e migliorata HMI è implementata nel cockpit digitale dietro il volante e nel più grande sistema di infotainment che ora è da 12,9” ed è dotato di cursore retroilluminato.
Entrambe le vetture montano il nuovo sistema audio hi-fi a 12 altoparlanti sviluppato in collaborazione con gli esperti audio di Sennheiser Mobility. Il sistema offre il suono puro e inconfondibile di Sennheiser, apprezzato dai creativi musicali e dagli artisti di tutto il mondo.
La gamma di propulsori comprende quattro diverse tecnologie: TSI (benzina), mild hybrid (eTSI), TDI (diesel) ed eHybrid (ibrido plug-in). La nuova generazione di motori ibridi plugin (e-HYBRID) erogano fino a 272 CV (200 kW), con oltre 100 km di autonomia in modalità completamente elettrica e ora compatibili con la ricarica rapida in corrente continua fino a 50 kW. Il nuovo motore a benzina (TSI) da 333 CV (245 kW) con tecnologia torque splitter sarà disponibile in esclusiva per la nuova CUPRA Formentor e la nuova CUPRA Leon.

Article: Hyundai conferma la sua leadership globale nel campo del design con un prestigioso riconoscimento ai Red Dot Award 2024, dove la Nuova SANTA FE ha ottenuto il premio nella categoria “Product Design: Cars and Motorcycles”, aggiudicandosi così uno dei tre principali premi di design al mondo.
La quinta generazione della SANTA FE, con il suo innovativo approccio al design denominato “Open for More”, offre uno spazio posteriore estremamente generoso e flessibile, che si distingue per la sua eccellenza nel settore. Questo risultato è reso possibile grazie all’allungamento del passo e all’ampia apertura del portellone posteriore. L’estensione del passo non solo consente una maggiore versatilità, ma migliora anche il comfort dei passeggeri nella terza fila di sedili.
Nuova SANTA FE si caratterizza per le sue linee squadrate e uno stile boxy: la parte anteriore genera una sensazione di imponenza grazie al cofano alto, ai fari a forma di H e ai parafanghi marcati. Gli elementi di design a forma di H reinterpretano l’iconica “H” di Hyundai, tratto che si ritrova nella fanaleria sia anteriore sia posteriore. La carrozzeria è definita da linee essenziali – come il tetto piatto, i passaruota ben definiti e lo sbalzo anteriore accorciato – per un look robusto ma anche elegante
L’abitacolo offre uno spazio interno generoso, con un ampio portellone posteriore che quando aperto ricorda quasi una terrazza. I sedili ripiegabili della seconda e terza fila offrono uno spazio ai vertici della categoria, enfatizzato dal design raffinato ricco di linee orizzontali e verticali
Le dotazioni high-tech includono un display panoramico e una doppia base di ricarica wireless. Per gli interni sono stati utilizzati materiali sostenibili, come plastica riciclata e similpelle ecologica. I colori, sia degli interni che degli esterni, si ispirano alla luce naturale, portando energia e dinamismo nell’esperienza a bordo.

Article: Matilde di Canossa , marchesa di Toscana, vice regina d’Italia è stata una delle donne più potenti del Medioevo. L’iconografia tradizionale la ritrae alternativamente in atteggiamento pio e devoto o come sovrana guerriera. (Da notare la statua in Vaticano in posa regale).
In effetti, aveva una personalità complessa. Una vena mistica che le faceva desiderare di chiudersi in convento si univa a un carattere indomito e autoritario. Si circondava di filosofi e teologi ma governava in prima persona un feudo immenso, tra più importanti d’Europa, che dalla Lombardia giungeva fino alle porte di Roma. E, in un territorio così vasto, occorreva sapersi relazionare con le città, i vassalli, le Chiese locali e le abbazie.
A questa donna potente ma tormentata nella sua vita privata, Cinzia Giorgio dedica il suo nuovo romanzo storico Io sono la contessa. (Matilde di Canossa: la vita di una delle più grandi donne della Storia) Newton Compton Editori 2024.
Un grande affresco in cui insieme alla protagonista si muovono altri personaggi di rilievo. Anzitutto l’imperatore Enrico IV suo cugino e irriducibile avversario ma forse l’unico uomo di cui sia stata innamorata. Poi la moglie Enrico, Berta, rivale ma anche amica. Il Papa Gregorio VII di cui la Gran Contessa era fervente sostenitrice tanto che la propaganda imperiale asseriva che ne fosse anche l’amante (ma fra questi due caratteri indomiti non mancavano momenti di scontro). Inoltre, Goffredo il Gobbo il primo marito di Matilde morto misteriosamente… e molti altri.
Dalla narrazione di Cinzia Giorgio emerge con forza la personalità della GranContessa, che segna le vicende storiche di cui è stata protagonista, come il celebre episodio dell’umiliazione di Canossa a cui si sottomise Enrico IV e che fu un insieme di diffidenze e di inganni.
Matilde che fece di tutto perché il cugino / nemico fosse liberato dalla scomunica che lo avrebbe privato del trono. Il Papa prevedeva che l’imperatore si sarebbe vendicato ma fu costretto a cedere dall’insistenza della sua potente alleata. La quale non era un’ingenua e quindi doveva avere lo stesso timore ma il suo desiderio di pace era tale da indurla a rischiare. Un libro avvincente, che si legge con passione perché è una sorta di full immersion in un Medioevo sanguigno, e violento (rientra in questo anche la prigionia in Germania della piccola Matilde) ricco di passioni come l’odio implacabile di Enrico dopo l’umiliazione di Canossa, ma anche di sfaccettature e di contraddizioni.
Tra l’altro l’introspezione piscologica della protagonista è accentuata dall’espediente letterario del ritrovamento di un manoscritto che si rivela essere una sorta di diario scritto di pugno signora di Canossa. Donna bellissima, passionale ma con una vena mistica come attestano anche le molte chiese matildine, splendido esempio di architettura medievale.
Una notazione personale: ho scritto in passato due brevi saggi e ho realizzato per Rai una fiction radiofonica in due puntate su Matilde.Questo romanzo mi ha sta aiutando a cogliere aspetti riposti che ritengo significativi. Ma adesso alcune notazioni a colloquio con Cinzia Giorgio.
Una Matilde, passionale, “sanguigna” che esce dall’iconografia tradizionale. Ma possiamo dire che aveva anche un carattere complesso e contraddittorio?
Non solo possiamo dirlo ma dobbiamo dirlo. Matilde era una donna anticonvenzionale, decisa, indomita, capace di amare e odiare con grande intensità.
Cosa ti ha colpito di più in questo personaggioi?
La sua voglia di libertà che emerge prepotente nei suoi scritti. È a tutti gli effetti una donna moderna.
Una delle donne più potenti della storia ma è vero che era anche molto bella?
Era bellissima. Alta, bionda, formosa e tonica (non dimentichiamo che ha indossato l’armatura fino all’ultima sua battaglia). La fama della sua avvenenza era diventata leggendaria quando lei era ancora in vita.
Senza spoilerare possiamo dire qualcosa dei suoi matrimoni sfortunati in particolare quello con Guelfo di Baviera che ebbe risvolti paradossali?
Il povero Guelfo era l’uomo sbagliato al momento sbagliato. E per momento intendo momento storico.
Il rapporto con Enrico IV era già adombrato da Pirandello. Ma suo cugino aveva ascendente un particolare su di lei?
È evidente anche nel loro carteggio, ma credo che fosse più Matilde ad avere un forte ascendente su di lui che non il contrario.
Enrico, un personaggio infido. E lei ?
Assolutamente no, era chiara e cristallina, sempre. Forse troppo. È stata fedele ai suoi ideali e propositi fino all’ultimo, sacrificando la sua stessa felicità.
Nel tuo romanzo c’è anche spazio per cogliere aspetti della società del tempo e anche notizie su banchetti e cibi medievali.
Vero, ieri come oggi il cibo ha sempre avuto un ruolo centrale in alcune situazioni. A volte è stato determinante. Basti pensare ai vari e “opportuni” avvelenamenti fino ad arrivare ai banchetti, dove venivano decise le sorti di intere nazioni.

Article: Il Gambero Rosso, grazie allo chef pluristellato Heinz Beck, è in grado di dire l’ultima parola sul più vecchio e misterioso dubbio che attanaglia gli amanti del fast food. Chi fa meglio le patatine tra le cinque insegne più popolari e diffuse McDonald’s, Burger King, KFC, Old Wild West, Roadhouse? Il numero di maggio ha scelto di metterle in copertina affidando i loro hamburger e le loro patatine ad uno dei palati più raffinati al mondo, quello di Heinz Beck, lo chef pluristellato de La pergola di Roma, che si è divertito a stilare una classifica destinata a scardinare tanti pre-giudizi.
Di blind, il test aveva solo l’improvvisazione: entrare a sorpresa in un giorno qualunque in ognuna delle insegne, ordinando dal touch screen e consumando un pasto come un cliente comune. Con un piccolo distinguo tra le prime tre – classico fast food – alle ultime due, Old Wild West e Roadhouse, caratterizzate da una proposta decisamente più ricca, dal servizio e anche da un costo differente “Cosa ti aspetti da un hamburger che costa un euro e trenta? Qualcosa di decente, caldo e commestibile” ha raccontato lo chef a Mara Nocilla che lo ha accompagnato nella compilazione della specialissima classifica. «Il criterio di valutazione non può essere lo stesso nei ristoranti dove il giudizio deve essere più severo, all’altezza della fascia di prezzo”. Come è andata?
Tra panini e patatine… la classifica
70 punti per Roadhouse che con la sua formula di ristorazione servita e con il classico menu di “cibo veloce” viene premiata per l’eccellenza delle sue carni e per la sua proposta che conquista e che vale un prezzo al di sopra della media rispetto al fast food essenziale e self-service.
Medaglia d’argento per McDonald’s, con 68 punti: la famosa catena americana di fast food si conquista per le sue sorprendenti patatine calde, croccanti, dorate in modo uniforme, poco salate, pulite e poco unte mentre la proposta degli hamburger risulta meno esaltante.
Burger King ottiene 60 punti riconfermandosi anche in questo caso la seconda catena d’oltreoceano: tra hamburger e patatine fritte il suo menu base raggiunge una sufficienza con diversi meno.
Lo stesso vale KFC – Kentucky Fried Chicken – una delle più famose catene di fast food del Nord America dove i 60 punti rivelano patatine appena sufficienti mentre l’hamburger nella media dei fast food, senza difetti evidenti, raggiunge la sufficienza piena.
Infine, con 55 punti, troviamo Old Wild West, la catena di fast food italiana con formula di ristorante servito specializzata in hamburger e cucina tex-mex, dove, però, l’offerta gastronomica non è delle più entusiasmante.

Article: La mostra Fair Play racconta, attraverso la pittura di Vittorio Pavoncello, il significato del tennis come uno sport che va oltre la semplice competizione fisica.
Il tratto minimale unito alla scelta accurata dei colori esprime la bellezza della sfida, la forza mentale e la grazia nell’esecuzione del gesto. I quadri di Vittorio Pavoncello diventano uno specchio della complessità e della ricchezza dell’esperienza tennistica.
L’artista riesce pienamente nel tentativo di semplificare e concentrare l’attenzione sull’essenziale, incoraggiando una riflessione più profonda da parte dello spettatore sui movimenti e i fondamentali più significativi che avvengano nell’interiorità del giocatore, nel campo e intorno ad esso.
Il tennis italiano sta vivendo un momento esaltante, legando la sua storia ad uno spettacolo sportivo sempre più di massa.
Sono molte le domande che ci potremmo porre e molte le risposte: è una gara, è una sfida, si è da soli, ci vuole abilità, forma fisica e tanto lavoro di testa.
Le numerose tele in mostra, di Vittorio Pavoncello, ci aiuteranno a leggere meglio il linguaggio più intimo di questo sport, che sta attraversando i nostri campi, le nostre televisioni e reti. Un linguaggio che sembra fatto per la nostra società e per quella prossima, dove le capacità richieste nella vita sembrano quelle del gioco del tennis.
Da qui l’idea di una mostra che partendo dagli Open di Roma 2024 possa poi aprirsi ad altri circuiti.
E il tennis come si dice per l’arte è uno sport che vuole farsi vedere, che si dà in mostra, non basta giocare a tennis se nessuno guarda chi gioca, come un quadro ha bisogno dell’osservatore e fruitore per vivere.

Article: Nissan presenta X-Trail N-Treck, la nuova versione dell’iconico crossover pensata per esaltare il suo carattere avventuroso. Nuovi e accattivanti elementi di design e rivestimenti interni resistenti all’acqua. Disponibile con tecnologia e-4ORCE, l’esclusiva trazione integrale Nissan per una maggiore sicurezza in tutte le condizioni
Tante novità che caratterizzano la vocazione outdoor della vettura, a partire dal nome N-Trek, per passare al design che conferisce al mezzo un aspetto ancora più robusto e imponente e ai nuovi interni resistenti all’acqua adatti a chi non si lascia intimorire dalle condizioni atmosferiche.
Il frontale si distingue per la nuova finitura di colore scuro che circonda la tipica griglia V-Motion, di colore cromato sugli altri allestimenti di X-Trail.
Il lato inferiore protettivo dei paraurti anteriore e posteriore ha una finitura in colore canna di fucile, mentre le calotte degli specchietti retrovisori sono di colore nero. I nuovi fendinebbia a LED sono stati integrati nella sezione inferiore del paraurti anteriore.
I clienti che vogliono rendere il proprio X-Trail N-Treck ancora più resistente e versatile possono acquistare il pacchetto opzionale che comprende tappetini in gomma e rivestimento reversibile – con un lato lavabile – del bagagliaio.
Per gli esterni sono disponibili i colori metallizzati Diamond Black e Dark Metal Grey e i colori perlati Pearl White, Champagne Grey e Ceramic Grey. Inoltre, Pearl White, Champagne Grey e Ceramic Grey sono disponibili in configurazioni bicolore con il tetto nero a contrasto.
Nissan X-Trail è equipaggiato con l’esclusivo propulsore e-POWER, costituito da un motore elettrico che muove le ruote della vettura (nella versione 4WD i motori elettrici sono due, uno per ogni asse) e da un sofisticato ed efficiente motore termico con rapporto di compressione variabile che produce energia elettrica. Il piacere di guida è quello tipico degli EV con accelerazione brillante e lineare, ma niente ricarica alla spina e per fare il pieno di energia basta mettere benzina nel serbatoio.
X-Trail N-Treck è disponibile, inoltre, con trazione integrale e-4ORCE, un brevetto Nissan frutto della decennale esperienza nelle tecnologie 4WD e costituito da motori elettrici, uno per ogni asse, e da un sofisticato sistema che regola la forza motrice e l’azione Torque Vectoring del freno sulle quattro ruote, che garantiscono prestazioni brillanti, sicurezza e massimo controllo su ogni tracciato e in ogni condizione.
Le caratteristiche più importanti di e-4ORCE sono la precisione e la velocità con cui il sistema regola la potenza motrice. Quando i sensori rilevano un cambio di aderenza su una o più ruote, come accade ad esempio in presenza di acqua, neve o ghiaccio, il sistema regola la forza motrice sulla singola ruota in un decimillesimo (1/10.000) di secondo, tutto automaticamente e senza la necessità di intervento del guidatore.
Arnaud Charpentier, Region Vice President Marketing & Mobility AMIEO (Africa, Middle East, India, Europe & Oceania), ha dichiarato: “Abbiamo iniziato lo sviluppo di X-Trail N-Trek con il semplice motto: Let’s Get Dirty, che incarna lo spirito di chi ama l’avventura, la vita all’aria aperta e vuole usare il proprio veicolo per godersi il tempo libero in compagnia. X-Trail N-Trek ha un look accattivante grazie a esclusivi dettagli di design, nuovi interni resistenti all’acqua e opzioni di vernice esterna bicolore. Tutti questi elementi uniti al propulsore elettrificato Nissan e-POWER e alla tecnologia e-4ORCE 4WD garantiranno ai nostri clienti avventure elettrizzanti.”

Article: Jannik Sinner dopo l’accesso ai quarti nel torneo di Madrid: “Ho scelto all’ultimo di giocare, era già successo all’inizio della mia carriera di dover superare certe situazioni. Domani valuterò la situazione dopo aver giocato oggi 2 ore” (con la sintesi video della partita)
Jannik Sinner: “Oggi è stata molto dura, il mio rivale ha giocato molto bene. Nel primo set ho commesso qualche errore di troppo, ma ho ripreso subito la concentrazione all’inizio del secondo. Nel terzo ho ricominciato a soffrire e a combattere, ho affrontato delle palle break e le ho giocate bene. Sono contento e vedremo cosa succedereà al prossimo turno.
Una partita molto difficile, ci conosciamo bene, il pubblico è stato fantastico. Sono molto felice di aver vinto. mi sento meglio di ieri, non come vorrei, ma sto provando a dare il meglio. Ieri è stato molto deludente per me.
“Penso che il fatto di avere giocato così tante partite quest’anno possa avere influito. Nella mia mente so che può succedere. Ho scelto all’ultimo di giocare, era già successo all’inizio della mia carriera di dover superare certe situazioni. Oggi fisicamente non ero ancora al 100%, ma sapevo che se avessi vinto oggi domani avrei potuto recuperare visto che c’è il giorno di riposo.
Oggi mi sentivo un po’ meglio fisicamente, non sono ancora al 100% ma quando ho la possibilità di giocare mi piace farlo. Sono contento della prestazione perché ero in difficoltà, poi ho alzato un po’ il livello, nel secondo e nel terzo sono riuscito a rispondere meglio. Posso essere contento e adesso vediamo come andrà la prossima partita“.
In conferenza stampa dichiara: “Domani sono curioso di vedere la reazione dopo la partita di oggi, che è durata due ore. Non ho paura, ma bisogna pensarci due volte perché adesso arrivano Roma, Parigi, poi Wimbledon e poi le Olimpiadi. Se la situazione dovesse peggiorare, ci penserò di nuovo. Vedremo come mi sentirò domani, sono curioso di vedere come reagisce la mia anca dopo aver giocato per due ore oggi.
Io e il mio fisioterapista abbiamo lavorato molto ieri, è stata una lunga notte. Ho cercato di recuperare, di dormire bene e oggi abbiamo fatto anche un paio di esercizi diversi per cercare di migliorare. Oggi ho deciso di giocare dopo il riscaldamento. Sapevo che avrei sofferto, ma l’ho accettato. Cerco anche di godermi il momento, perché se non ti diverti a giocare a tennis è dura. Se posso giocare e divertirmi, giocherò, altrimenti non giocherò. Domani prenderò una decisione“.
Oggi il livello era buono, entrambi abbiamo servito bene. Non si tratta solo di essere al 100% dal punto di vista fisico, bisogna anche guardare agli aspetti positivi e riconoscere i momenti importanti della partita. Lui ha fatto meglio nel primo e io nel secondo e terzo set. È un giocatore molto costante da molti anni. Sono felice per la vittoria, è stata una bella giornata e vedremo cosa succederà. Mi sento meglio di ieri. Il mio obiettivo principale è essere al 100% fisicamente. Oggi è stata una partita diversa perché era la prima senza il tetto coperto e su un campo diverso. Ho dovuto abituarmi a queste condizioni, soprattutto nel primo set, ma sono contenta di come ho girato la situazione nel secondo e terzo set“.

Article: Rafa Nadal e il Mutua Madrid Open: una storia d’amore giunta al termine (sintesi video della partita)
La sconfitta di Rafa Nadal agli ottavi di finale del Mutua Madrid Open segna la fine di un’era. Il tennista maiorchino, cinque volte campione del torneo, è stato fermato dal ceco Jiri Lehecka con il punteggio di 7-5 6-4. Nonostante la determinazione e il supporto del pubblico, Nadal non è riuscito a superare l’ostacolo rappresentato dal giovane avversario.
Il match è stato caratterizzato da un equilibrio iniziale, con entrambi i giocatori che hanno mostrato un tennis di alto livello. Lehecka ha impressionato per la potenza del servizio e la solidità del dritto, mentre Nadal ha risposto con le sue proverbiali doti di lottatore e la sua abilità nel variare il gioco. Tuttavia, il ceco è riuscito a trovare le contromisure necessarie per contrastare il gioco del maiorchino, salvando anche due palle break nel primo set.
Nonostante Nadal abbia provato in tutti i modi a rimanere aggrappato al match, Lehecka ha dimostrato una maggiore incisività nei momenti chiave. Il break subito nel finale del primo set ha complicato la situazione per il campione spagnolo, che si è trovato costretto a inseguire nel secondo parziale perdendo subito il servizio nel primo gioco. Pur lottando con tutte le sue energie, Nadal non è riuscito a trovare il guizzo necessario per ribaltare le sorti dell’incontro con il ceco che chiudeva per 6 a 4 dopo aver avuto anche tre occasioni per un doppio break nel terzo game.
La sconfitta di Nadal rappresenta un momento significativo nella storia del torneo di Madrid. Il pubblico ha tributato al campione un’ovazione commovente, consapevole di aver assistito probabilmente all’ultima apparizione del maiorchino nella capitale spagnola. Rafa Nadal ha scritto pagine indelebili nella storia del Mutua Madrid Open, conquistando cinque titoli e regalando al pubblico emozioni indimenticabili.
Nonostante il risultato non sia stato quello sperato, Nadal ha dimostrato ancora una volta il suo immenso valore, lottando fino all’ultimo punto e onorando il torneo che tanto gli ha dato. La sua uscita di scena lascia un vuoto nel cuore dei tifosi, ma il ricordo delle sue imprese rimarrà per sempre nella memoria degli appassionati di tennis.
Ora, mentre Jiri Lehecka prosegue il suo cammino nel torneo, Rafa Nadal si prepara ad affrontare nuove sfide, con la consapevolezza di aver dato tutto se stesso in un luogo che considera la sua seconda casa. Madrid e il Mutua Open rendono omaggio a un campione che ha scritto la storia, un atleta che ha saputo emozionare e ispirare milioni di persone in tutto il mondo. Grazie, Rafa, per averci regalato momenti indimenticabili.

Article: I primi mesi del 2024 hanno dato una decisa svolta alla carriera di Luciano Darderi. A febbraio il tennista classe 2002, numero 60 del ranking mondiale, ha vinto a Cordoba il suo primo titolo Atp, poi ha ribadito di avere il tennis per stare a tempo pieno nel circuito maggiore e ora cerca gloria anche sulla terra battuta del Tennis Club Cagliari. Era il primo italiano in gara nel main draw del Sardegna Open, evento premium della categoria ATP Challenger 175 dotato di 205.000 euro di montepremi, e all’esordio ha colto un bel successo contro l’argentino Thiago Agustin Tirante, imponendosi in rimonta al termine di una battaglia di grande intensità. Di fronte al nutrito pubblico del Centrale è finita 3-6 6-3 6-4, con Darderi capace di emergere alla distanza e far pesare la sua superiorità nel finale. Un primo allungo sul 4-2 del terzo set non è stato sufficiente, ma dal 4-4 l’azzurro è stato perfetto: prima ha tenuto a zero il proprio turno di servizio e poi non ha più sbagliato, spingendo il rivale all’errore che gli ha regalato il successo, appena prima che un potente acquazzone obbligasse alla sospensione – e poi al rinvio a mercoledì – della rimanente parte del programma. Giovedì per Darderi, letteralmente assalito al termine dell’incontro da ragazzini a caccia di foto e autografi, ci sarà uno fra il giapponese Daniel e l’argentino Ugo Carabelli. A Monte Urpinu ha conquistato il secondo round anche il nipponico Yoshihito Nishioka, determinato a migliorare la prestazione incolore di dodici mesi fa, quando da favorito numero uno salutò il torneo all’esordio. Ha già fatto meglio quest’anno, battendo senza grandi difficoltà il peruviano Juan Pablo Varillas (6-2 6-4).
Nel martedì del Sardegna Open sono anche terminate le qualificazioni, senza soddisfazioni per i tennisti italiani impegnati nel turno decisivo. Erano in tre e si sono arresi tutti, portando negli spogliatoi non pochi rimpianti. In particolare Andrea Pellegrino e Francesco Passaro: il primo ha condotto per 6-1 4-2 contro l’argentino (tesserato al Tc Cagliari) Juan Manuel Cerundolo, prima di perdere nove game di fila e di lì a poco anche l’incontro. Mentre Passaro pareva aver ribaltato la sfida contro l’olandese Jesper De Jong quando si è portato sul 4-1 nel terzo set, con due break di vantaggio. Ma il rivale ha risalito la corrente e l’ha punito al tie-break, spuntandola per 6-3 6-7 7-6. In tre set pure la sconfitta di Cecchinato, battuto per 7-5 3-6 6-4 dal giapponese Shintaro Mochizuki. Nel main draw anche il canadese Gabriel Diallo, prossimo avversario di Cerundolo in una sfida che deciderà il primo sfidante a Cagliari di Lorenzo Musetti (in campo giovedì). La cancellazione degli ultimi due incontri di singolare di giornata regalerà un mercoledì – coi biglietti già esauriti – ancora più ricco, grazie alla bellezza di 15 incontri. Si parte alle 11 e il clou sarà sul Centrale da metà pomeriggio, quando toccherà prima a Fabio Fognini (contro Federico Coria) e poi a Lorenzo Sonego, che inizierà la caccia al suo secondo titolo al Tc Cagliari contro lo statunitense Alex Michelsen.

Article: Nel 2023 Marco Cecchinato era uno dei grandi attesi della vigilia, ma una volta arrivato al Tennis Club Cagliari fu costretto al forfait per un attacco febbrile. Dodici mesi dopo, invece, al Sardegna Open – evento premium della categoria ATP Challenger 175 – il siciliano si è presentato a fari spenti, costretto a giocare le qualificazioni da una classifica (n. 288 Atp) che non era così bassa da oltre dieci anni. Ma il suo tennis sa ancora funzionare e l’ha dimostrato al debutto sul Centrale, spazzando via per 6-0 6-2 in 55 minuti il giapponese Tatsuma Ito. Un test attendibile il giusto, visto che il nipponico ha annunciato il ritiro a fine stagione e oggi è impegnato in primis come coach del connazionale Shintaro Mochizuki, il quale peraltro (curiosità) sarà l’avversario di Cecchinato martedì alle 10, nel match che vale l’accesso al main draw. Ma l’azzurro ha fatto il suo e da Monte Urpinu punta a lanciare la rinascita. “Sono a Cagliari per ritrovarmi – dice l’ex semifinalista del Roland Garros –, nel momento più duro della mia carriera. Lo scorso settembre, dopo lo Us Open ho deciso di staccare per tre mesi: dopo 15 anni di sacrifici ne sentivo il bisogno, non ne avevo più. Poi, a inizio anno ho pensato di ripartire da un nuovo team trasferendomi a Barcellona, ma non ha funzionato”. È stato un duro colpo, però non si è arreso. “Due settimane fa mi sono presentato a Vicenza da Massimo Sartori (suo storico mentore, ndr) dicendogli che o sarei tornato ad allenarmi con lui o avrei smesso. Per fortuna, a Max e Fabio Silvestri, che mi accompagnerà nei tornei, è bastato poco per rimettermi in sesto. Ho ritrovato la voglia di lottare e il giusto atteggiamento. Per me è un nuovo inizio: risalire non sarà facile, ma sono pronto a provarci”.
Insieme a Cecchinato hanno raggiunto il turno decisivo delle qualificazioni anche Francesco Passaro e Andrea Pellegrino. Il primo ha superato l’austriaco Miedler con un doppio 6-3 e sfiderà l’olandese Jesper De Jong, mentre Pellegrino ha domato in rimonta Samuele Pieri (4-6 6-2 6-0) e martedì – si parte alle 10 – si contenderà la qualificazione con l’argentino Juan Manuel Cerundolo. Sempre martedì al Tc Cagliari scatta anche il tabellone principale di singolare, con i primi 4 incontri sul Centrale a partire dalle 12. Grande attesa per il debutto dell’azzurro Luciano Darderi, numero 60 Atp e uno dei tre italiani (con Sinner e Berrettini) capaci di vincere un titolo nel circuito maggiore nel 2024. Ad attenderlo, nel pomeriggio, l’argentino Thiago Agustin Tirante, suo compagno di doppio in Sardegna. A seguire il debutto della wild card Francesco Maestrelli, contro il portoghese Nuno Borges. Mercoledì, invece, toccherà a Lorenzo Sonego, Fabio Fognini e Giulio Zeppieri. Giovedì alle prime quattro teste di serie, in gara dal secondo round. Da martedì anche il main draw di doppio, con al via grazie a una wild card anche la coppia cagliaritana Sanna/Dessì.

Article: "아직도 전재준이라고 불리지만…차근차근히 하다 보면 제 이름 되찾겠죠"
"사실 요즘은 욕먹기 싫어서 꽁꽁 싸매고 밖에 나가요. (웃음) 다 가리고 있는데도 제가 일행한테 한마디 건네면 주변에서 '어 전재준이다!' 이러더라고요."
넷플릭스 화제작 '더 글로리' 속 강렬한 악역 연기로 화제를 모았던 배우 박성훈(39)은 아직도 본명 대신 배역 이름인 '전재준'으로 불린다.
길을 걷다가 그를 알아본 시민들은 전재준이라는 이름을 외치며 화들짝 놀라 수군거리고, 심지어 최근 종영한 tvN 드라마 '눈물의 여왕' 촬영 현장 스태프조차 그를 '박재준 씨'라고 잘못 부르고는 했다고 한다.
인상 깊은 연기로 '이름을 잃어버린 배우'가 된 박성훈을 지난 29일 서울 강남구 논현동 BH엔터테인먼트 사옥에서 만났다.
박성훈은 "재준이 소리를 듣는 게 오히려 재밌다"며 "한 작품씩 해내다 보면 또 다른 이름으로 불리다가 언젠가는 제 이름을 다시 찾지 않겠느냐"고 호탕하게 웃었다.
그는 "박성훈이라는 이름이 너무 흔해서 예명을 고민했던 적도 있는데, 박성훈 중에 제일 유명한 사람이 되겠다는 마음으로 열심히 살았다"고 말했다.
"인터넷에 박성훈을 검색하면 65명 정도 있는데, 그래도 이제 제가 그중에는 제일 먼저 나오거든요. 제일 유명한 박성훈이 된 것 같으니, 이제 박성훈이라는 이름을 더 널리 알리겠다는 목표를 다시 세워야겠네요. (웃음)"
tvN 역대 최고 시청률(24.8％)로 종영한 '눈물의 여왕'에서도 박성훈은 묵직한 존재감을 드러냈다. 잔혹한 민낯을 감춘 엘리트 윤은성 역을 맡아 선 굵은 연기를 펼쳐냈다.
능력과 재력을 가진 사이코패스라는 점에서 전재준과 비슷한데, 박성훈에게 윤은성은 전혀 다른 캐릭터로 보였다고 한다.
그는 "외적인 스타일링뿐 아니라 연기할 때 발성과 표정 등도 전혀 다르게 했다"며 "'날티' 나는 재준이는 위협적으로 비치지 않기를 바랐기 때문에 대사에 높낮이를 살리면서 화를 내더라도 말끝을 강조했지만, 극에 긴장감을 조성하는 역할이었던 은성이는 꾹꾹 눌러 말하는 말투로 말 앞머리를 강조했다"고 설명했다.
월가 애널리스트 출신 인수합병(M＆A) 전문가 윤은성에게 인생의 목표는 홍해인(김지원 분) 단 하나다. 오래전 첫사랑인 홍해인을 갖기 위해서 온갖 악행도 서슴지 않는다.
박성훈은 "윤은성이 조금이라도 애잔하게 느껴지기를 바랐다"고 강조했다.
"홍해인에게 '죽여서라도 데려가겠다'고 말하는 마지막 장면에서 굉장히 다층적인 감정을 느꼈는데, 윤은성의 사랑도 극단적인 사랑의 한 형태라고 생각했어요. 짠하고, 애처로워 보였으면 좋겠다는 마음이 있었죠."
대학 졸업 후 대학로 연극 무대에서 활동하다가 2008년 영화 '쌍화점' 속 단역으로 데뷔한 박성훈은 "연기를 시작한 후 제게 가장 큰 동력이 돼준 것은 자격지심과 가난이었다"고 밝혔다.
배우로서는 데뷔 후 금수저를 물고 태어난 엘리트 역을 자주 맡았지만, 그가 살아온 실제 삶은 그가 연기한 캐릭터들과 전혀 달랐다고 한다. 그는 "사실 젊을 때 집안 형편 때문에 고생을 많이 했었다"고 털어놨다.
다음달 1일 방송될 tvN 토크쇼 '유 퀴즈 온 더 블럭'을 촬영하면서 7년여간 영화 '기생충'에 나왔던 반지하 집과 비슷한 곳에서 살았다고 고백하기도 한 박성훈은 "연기 수업에서 가장 못 하는 학생이었기 때문에 잘하고 싶은 마음에 스스로를 몰아세웠고, 당장의 생활비가 급급했기 때문에 쉬지 않고 연달아 대학로 무대에 올랐다"고 떠올렸다.
"남들 앞에만 서면 덜덜 떠는데, 그게 너무 싫었어요. 제 생각에는 연기도 반에서 제일 못했거든요. 언제 한번은 제가 무대에 올랐는데, 첫 대사에 친구들이 모두 웃음을 터트린 적도 있어요. 저는 사람들 앞에 나서기 힘들어하는 사람이지만, 캐릭터를 입었을 때 다른 모습을 보여줄 수 있다는 점에서 희열을 느꼈고, 꿈에 대한 확신이 있었죠."
"쉬는 걸 불안해하는 스타일이라서 소처럼 쉬지 않고 일하는 편"이라는 박성훈은 올해 최고 기대작 중 하나로 꼽히는 넷플릭스 '오징어 게임' 시즌2에도 출연할 예정이다.
그는 작품이나 배역에 대한 말은 최대한 아끼면서도 "그동안 보여드린 박성훈의 모습과는 확실하게 다를 것"이라고 자신감을 드러냈다.
차기작인 영화 '열대야' 촬영을 위해 인터뷰 다음날 태국 방콕으로 출국할 예정이라는 박성훈은 "마약 거래상 역할을 맡아서 '눈물의 여왕' 때보다 살을 10kg가량 감량했다"며 "이제 다음에는 웬만하면 악역을 피하고 싶다"고 했다.
"어머니가 '꼴 보기 싫다', '너만 나오면 짜증 난다', '제발 좀 그만해라'고 하시더라고요. (웃음) 원래도 개그 욕심이 있어서 코믹 연기가 특히 욕심나요. 다음에는 꼭 로맨틱 코미디를 하고 싶습니다."

Article: 마약류에 취한 채 운전하다 행인을 치어 숨지게 한 이른바 ‘압구정 롤스로이스’ 사건 가해자 남성이 상습 마약 혐의로 추가 기소됐다.
1일 법조계에 따르면 서울중앙지검 강력범죄수사부(김연실 부장검사)는 지난달 29일 신모(28)씨를 마약류 관리법 위반(향정)과 주민등록법 위반 혐의로 불구속 기소했다고 밝혔다.
검찰은 신씨가 2022년 6월부터 이듬해 8월2일까지 14개 병원에서 총 57회에 걸쳐 프로포폴 등 수면마취제를 상습 투약한 혐의를 추가로 포착해 기소했다. 그는 타인의 명의를 도용하며 소위 ‘병원 쇼핑’의 방법으로 마약류를 처방받았다. 신씨는 일부 마약류는 병원 처방 이력이 남지 않는 점을 이용해 여러 병원을 돌며 중복 처방을 받은 것으로 조사됐다.
신씨는 지난해 8월2일 오후 8시10분쯤 서울 강남구 압구정역 4번 출구 인근 도로에서 롤스로이스 차량을 운전하다 인도로 돌진해 20대 여성을 다치게 하고 구호 조치 없이 도주했다. 뇌사 상태에 빠진 피해자는 약 넉 달 뒤인 같은 해 11월25일 사망했다.
신씨는 사고 당일 시술을 명목으로 성형외과에서 미다졸람 등 향정신성 의약품을 투약했고 오전 11시부터 오후 8시까지 약 9시간 마취한 뒤 깨어난 직후 운전대를 잡은 것으로 조사됐다. 이에 신씨는 도주 치사와 위험운전치사 혐의로 1심에서 징역 20년을 선고받았으나 항소해 2심 재판이 진행 중이다.
검찰은 도주 치사 사건과 별개로 상습 마약류 투약 혐의에 대해서도 신씨에게 법적 책임을 묻겠다는 방침이다. 이 혐의에 대해서도 유죄가 선고되면 신씨는 20년 이상 징역을 살게 될 것으로 보인다. 검찰은 “죄에 상응하는 형이 선고되도록 공소 유지에 만전을 기하겠다”고 밝혔다.

Article: <앵커>
봄비가 내리기 시작하면서 산란한 양서류들이 본격적인 이동을 시작했습니다. 창원의 한 도심 공원에서 부화한 새끼 두꺼비들이 서식지로 이동하고 있는데요, 성체로 자라기까지 아직 힘겨운 여정이 남아 있습니다.
KNN 최한솔 기자가 취재했습니다.
<기자>
경남 창원의 한 도심 공원입니다.
새끼손톱만 한 생물이 연못가를 기어오릅니다.
힘겹게 풀숲에 오르고 몇몇은 공원 산책로를 기어가는데 자칫하면 밟히기 십상입니다.
비가 내리기 시작하면서 본격적으로 이동을 시작한 새끼 두꺼비입니다.
지난 2월 인근 산과 하천에서 모여든 두꺼비들이 산란한 녀석들입니다.
2만여 마리를 산란했는데 생존율은 극히 낮습니다.
도심 속 공원이라 밟혀 죽거나 배수로에 빠져 말라죽는 개체들이 대부분입니다.
[김미라/경남 양서류네트워크 활동가 : 아무리 자연 상태라도 (생존율은) 2~3%라고 보고 있거든요. (이곳에) 관찰한 개체 수로 봐서는 한 1백 마리, 2백 마리….]
그나마 3년 전 지자체가 배수로를 깎아 생태 통로를 만들면서 생존율은 많이 높아졌지만, 무심코 지나가는 길에 밟혀 죽는 일은 여전합니다.
지금도 이곳엔 새끼 두꺼비들 수백 마리가 천천히 이동하고 있습니다.
햇빛을 피해 풀숲에 숨어서 이동하기 때문에 잘 보이지 않을 뿐인데요, 자세히 관찰하면 이들의 움직임은 충분히 포착할 수 있습니다.
이제는 귀해진 새끼 두꺼비들과의 공존을 위해 본격적인 서식지 이동이 시작되는 5월 한 달은 세심한 배려가 필요해 보입니다.

Article: 세계적인 커피 체인점 스타벅스의 1분기 실적이 시장 예상치에 미치지 못하는 '어닝 쇼크'를 기록했습니다.
스타벅스는 지난 1분기 85억 6천만 달러(11조 8천727억 원)의 매출과 주당 0.68달러의 순이익을 기록했다고 30일(현지시간) 밝혔습니다.
매출은 지난해 같은 기간보다 약 2% 줄어들면서 시장조사기관 LSEG가 집계한 91억 3천만 달러에 미치지 못했습니다.
스타벅스의 분기 매출이 감소한 것은 코로나19 때인 2020년 이후 처음입니다.
순이익도 7억 7천240만 달러로 월가 전망치 9억 830만 달러를 크게 하회했습니다.
스타벅스는 2024 회계연도 매출 증가율을 기존 7∼10%에서 5% 이하로 낮춰 잡았고, 순이익도 지난해와 비슷한 수준에 그칠 것으로 내다봤습니다.
동일 매장 매출은 1년 전보다 4% 줄어들면서 1% 늘어날 것이라는 시장 기대치를 충족하지 못했습니다.
가장 큰 시장인 미국에서의 동일 매장 매출은 3%, 중국 매출은 11% 각각 줄었습니다.
랙스먼 내러시먼 최고경영자(CEO)는 "매우 도전적인 환경에서 이번 분기 실적은 우리 브랜드의 힘이나 역량, 앞으로의 기회를 반영하지 못한다"고 말했습니다.
레이첼 루게리 최고재무책임자(CFO)는 "예년보다 추운 날씨로 매장 방문이 감소하고, 중동 분쟁 등으로 분기 실적이 타격을 입었다"고 분석했습니다.
중동 전쟁 이후 스타벅스는 친이스라엘 기업으로 분류되면서 불매 운동의 직격탄을 맞고 있습니다.
스타벅스가 이스라엘을 지지하고 이스라엘 정부와 이스라엘 군에 자금을 댄다는 주장이 퍼지면서 곤욕을 치르고 있습니다.
스타벅스는 오해 때문에 불매운동의 타깃이 됐다고 해명하기도 했습니다.
스타벅스는 4분기부터 실적이 개선될 것으로 내다봤습니다.
이날 뉴욕 증시 정규장에서 0.18% 상승했던 스타벅스 주가는 실적 발표 후 시간 외 거래에서는 12% 급락했습니다.

Article: 트럼프 “부자 한국 왜 방어?”…주한미군 철수 시사하며 방위비 압박
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
오는 11월 미국 대선의 유력 후보인 트럼프 전 대통령이 미국 언론과의 인터뷰에서 주한미군 철수 가능성을 시사하는 발언을 했습니다.
과거 재임 시절과 같이 방위비 분담금의 대폭 인상을 요구하기 위한 거란 분석도 나옵니다.
워싱턴 이정민 특파원입니다.
[리포트]
공화당 대선 후보인 트럼프 전 대통령이 미국 시사주간지 타임과의 인터뷰에서 주한미군에 대한 견해를 밝혔습니다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 주한미군을 두고 "위험한 곳에 4만 명의 미군이 있다", "말도 안 된다. 왜 우리가 다른 누군가를 방어해야 하냐"고 말했습니다.
그러면서 한국을 두고 "매우 부유한 나라"라고 덧붙였습니다.
타임지는 트럼프 전 대통령의 이 발언에 대해 한국이 주한미군을 더 많이 지원하지 않으면 미군이 철수할 가능성을 시사한 발언이라고 설명했습니다.
타임지는 또 주한미군 규모가 실제 2만 8천5백 명인데 4만 명이라고 트럼프 전 대통령이 잘못 언급했다고도 지적했습니다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 지난 2월, 북대서양조약기구, 나토에 방위비를 늘리지 않는다면 더 이상 보호하지 않겠다는 발언을 해 파장을 일으킨 바 있습니다.
[도널드 트럼프/미국 전 대통령/공화당 대선 경선 후보/2월 : "나는 (나토를) 보호하지 않을 겁니다. 사실 러시아에게 하고 싶은 대로 하라고 독려할 거예요. (나토는) 돈을 지불해야죠."]
한국에 대해서도 주한미군 철수 가능성을 언급하며 큰 폭의 방위비 인상을 압박하는 걸로 풀이됩니다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 대통령 재임 당시 한국에 방위비 분담금으로 전년의 6배에 가까운 50억 달러, 우리 돈 6조 원을 요구했고, 재임 기간 주한미군 철군도 꾸준히 주장했던 것으로 알려져 있습니다.
한미 양국은 지난달 말부터 2026년에 적용될 새 방위비분담 특별협정 체결을 위한 협상에 착수했습니다.
대선 전에 협상을 마무리하기 위해 앞당겨 협상을 개시했다는 해석이 나옵니다.
하지만 미국 정가는 한미 양국이 방위비 협상을 마치더라도 트럼프 전 대통령이 재선된다면 재협상을 요구할 가능성을 배제할 수 없다고 전망하고 있습니다.

Article: ‘범죄도시 4’ 개봉 7일째 500만 관객 돌파
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의

상반기 최고 흥행작인 '파묘'(10일)보다 사흘 빨리 500만 관객을 달성했다.
지난달 24일 극장에 걸린 '범죄도시 4'는 개봉 이틀째에 100만명을 돌파하며 흥행에 시동을 걸었다.
나흘째인 27일엔 하루 만에 121만9천여명의 관객을 동원하며 300만명을 넘어서는 등 관객을 싹쓸이하고 있다.
이날 오전 9시 기준 '범죄도시 4'의 예매율은 79.4％, 예매 관객 수는 44만여 명으로 예매율 2위작인 '쿵푸팬더 4'(3.9％, 2만여 명)를 큰 격차로 앞서고 있다.
근로자의 날인 이날을 비롯해 오는 4∼6일 어린이날 연휴에도 관객몰이를 이어갈 것으로 전망된다.

Article: VOA “제3국 선박 북한 인근서 28시간 사라져…대북제재 위반 의혹”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
VOA는 팔라우 선적의 2천800여 톤 규모 화물선인 씨씨 나인(C Sea Nine)호가 지난달 26일 타이완 해역을 출항해 29일 오후 1시쯤 북한 황해남도 장산곶에서 약 24km 떨어진 지점에 도달한 뒤 지도상에서 사라졌다고 전했습니다.
씨씨 나인호는 하루 뒤인 30일 오후 5시에 다시 나타났는데, 선박의 위치정보를 발신하는 자동식별장치(AIS)를 끄고 28시간 동안 북한 항구에 기항했을 것으로 추정됩니다.
VOA는 씨씨 나인호가 과거 대북제재를 위반한 선박의 행태를 그대로 답습하고 있어 대북제재 위반 의혹이 제기된다고 전했습니다.
국제해사기구(IMO)는 국제 수역을 운항하는 선박들이 운항 중 자동식별장치를 켜두는 것을 의무화하고 있어, 씨씨 나인호의 이 같은 운행은 IMO 규정 위반에 해당됩니다.

Article: 오늘부터 병원서도 마스크 의무 해제…코로나19 ‘관심’으로 하향
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
코로나19 중앙사고수습본부가 지난달 19일 코로나19 위기 단계를 ‘경계’에서 가장 낮은 ‘관심’으로 하향 예고하면서 오늘부터 병원급 의료기관과 입소형 감염 취약시설에 의무로 남아있던 마스크 착용이 권고로 변경됐습니다.
요양병원 등 감염 취약시설 입소자가 반드시 해야 했던 선제 검사도 권고로 변경됐습니다.
확진자 격리 권고 기준도 기존 검체 채취일부터 5일 격리 권고에서 코로나19 주요 증상이 호전된 뒤 24시간 격리 권고로 더 완화됐습니다.
코로나19 검사비는 기본적으로 지원하지 않고 먹는 치료제 대상군, 의료취약지역 요양기관 환자, 응급실 내원 환자, 중환자실 입원환자 중 유증상자에 대해서만 신속항원검사 비용을 지원합니다.
전 국민에 무료 접종됐던 코로나19 백신은 내년부터 65세 이상 고령층과 면역 저하자 등 고위험군에만 무료로 접종합니다.

Article: 시흥 고가차로 공사 현장서 상판 붕괴…부산 아파트 화재로 1명 숨져
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
어제 오후, 경기 시흥시의 한 고가차로 공사 현장에서 구조물이 붕괴돼 7명이 다쳤습니다.
또, 어젯밤 부산의 한 아파트에서 불이 나 남성 한 명이 숨진 채 발견됐습니다.
밤 사이 사건·사고 소식, 이규명 기자의 보도입니다.
[리포트]
곳곳에 나뒹구는 시멘트와 철근 더미.
부서진 대형 구조물 일부는 크레인에 위태롭게 매달려 있습니다.
어제 오후 4시 반쯤 경기 시흥시 월곶가교 공사 현장에서 54m 길이의 대형 구조물이 추락했습니다.
크레인이 교량 기둥 사이를 잇는 상판 부분을 옮기던 중 구조물이 추락한 것으로 추정되고 있습니다.

어제 오후, 경기 시흥시의 한 고가차로 공사 현장에서 구조물이 붕괴돼 7명이 다쳤습니다.
또, 어젯밤 부산의 한 아파트에서 불이 나 남성 한 명이 숨진 채 발견됐습니다.
밤 사이 사건·사고 소식, 이규명 기자의 보도입니다.
[리포트]
곳곳에 나뒹구는 시멘트와 철근 더미.
부서진 대형 구조물 일부는 크레인에 위태롭게 매달려 있습니다.
어제 오후 4시 반쯤 경기 시흥시 월곶가교 공사 현장에서 54m 길이의 대형 구조물이 추락했습니다.
크레인이 교량 기둥 사이를 잇는 상판 부분을 옮기던 중 구조물이 추락한 것으로 추정되고 있습니다.

Article: 서울교통공사, 성희롱·폭언하는 상습 악성 민원인 ‘블랙리스트’로 관리
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
안내 메시지를 내보내고 직원에게 보호장비를 주던 기존의 소극적 방식에서 벗어나 악성 민원이 발생할 경우 적극적으로 고소·고발하고 상습 악성 민원인은 블랙리스트(주의 고객)로 등록해 일정 기간 민원 접수를 차단하는 방안을 추진할 계획입니다.
또 공사가 답변을 했음에도 3회 이상 반복해 민원을 제기하면 해당 사안이 종결됐음을 통지하고 이후에도 계속 민원을 낼 경우 법적 대응까지 검토할 방침입니다.
지금까지는 민원 전화가 연결되기 전에 산업안전보건법에 따른 감정노동자 보호 안내가 송출되고 민원 담당자에게 휴가를 부여하거나 녹음기 등 보호장비를 지급해 왔지만, 기존 방식으로는 악성 민원으로 인한 업무 차질과 직원들의 사기 저하를 막기 어렵다는 게 공사의 설명입니다.
서울교통공사는 악성 민원 대응 차원에서 직원 심리상담도 늘리고 민원 담당자의 개인정보를 비공개로 해 이들을 보호하기로 했습니다.
공사에 따르면 지난해 접수된 총 민원 135만 7천384건 가운데 3.8%인 5만 1천711건이 악성 민원으로 집계됐습니다.
이는 성희롱, 욕설, 폭언, 협박 등 범죄에 해당하는 사례와 반복적인 억지 주장 등 업무에 방해 또는 악성 민원으로 전환될 가능성이 큰 사례를 합한 수치입니다.
접수창구별로는 고객센터가 4만 9천322건에 달했고 홈페이지가 2천213건, 서울시 응답소로 들어온 사례가 176건으로 집계됐습니다.
접수된 실제 사례로는 ‘멍청하다’, ‘지하철을 개판으로 운행한다’며 모욕을 주거나 자신이 비행기를 놓쳤다며 직원을 살해하겠다고 협박, 1년에 열차 차량번호를 무려 1만 5천 번 정도 문의한 경우도 있었다고 공사는 설명했습니다.

Article: 여야, ‘5월 임시국회’ 의사 일정 협상 ‘줄다리기’
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
국회에서는 21대 국회 마지막 임시국회 의사 일정을 놓고 여야의 줄다리기가 계속되고 있습니다.
민주당은 내일 본회의를 열어 해병대원 특검법 등을 처리하겠다고 거듭 압박했는데 여당은 민생과 관련 없는 법안 처리엔 응할 수 없다며 맞섰습니다.
추재훈 기자입니다.
[리포트]
21대 국회 임기가 이제 한 달 남은 상황.
처리해야 할 법안들이 산적해 있지만 여야는 평행선만 달리고 있습니다.
더불어민주당 요구로 5월 임시국회가 소집됐는데 본회의 일정을 못 잡고 있는 겁니다.
민주당은 21대 국회에서 해병대원 특검법과 전세 사기 특별법 등을 처리하자고 거듭 압박했습니다.
[홍익표/더불어민주당 원내대표 : "이것을 처리하지 않으면 21대 국회는 정말 국민들에게 면목이 없게 될 겁니다. 5월 2일 국회 반드시 열게 만들 겁니다."]
이태원 참사 특별법 재의결을 촉구하는 목소리도 나왔습니다.
[남인순/더불어민주당 의원 : "여야 선배, 동료 국회의원들에게 촉구합니다. 5월 국회에서 이태원 참사 특별법 재의결합시다. 압도적 찬성으로 반드시 통과시킵시다."]
국회법상 특별한 사정이 없으면 매주 목요일에 본회의를 열어야 한다는 게 민주당 입장입니다.
이에 대해 국민의힘은 고준위방폐물법처럼 시급한 법안 처리를 위한 것이라면 모르겠지만 민생과 관련 없는 본회의는 열 수 없다고 맞서고 있습니다.
[윤재옥/국민의힘 대표 권한대행 겸 원내대표 : "정쟁을 유발할 수 있는 그런 법안들을 처리하겠다는 본회의는 동의하기 어렵습니다."]
공수처 수사가 진행 중인 해병대원 사건 관련 특검법은 물론 민주유공자법 등 민주당이 단독으로 본회의에 직회부한 법안들에도 반대 입장을 고수 중입니다.
[정경희/국민의힘 국회의원 : "특혜를 대물림하는 법안을 아무런 합의도 없이 날치기하다니 뻔뻔스럽기 짝이 없습니다. 민주유공자법을 빙자한 셀프 유공자법을 즉각 철회하십시오."]
여야가 팽팽히 맞서고 있는 가운데 오는 4일부터 18일까지 해외 순방이 예정된 김진표 국회의장의 선택에 관심이 쏠립니다.

Article: 의대 증원 1,500명대 중반 전망…“국립대 중심 증원분 감축”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
이런 가운데 2025학년도 의대 증원 규모는 1,500명대 중반으로 잠정 집계됐습니다.
정부 원안 2천 명 보다 400여 명 줄어든 건데, 의료 공백 사태의 물꼬를 트겠다며 정원 조정안을 제시했던 국립대들이 증원 폭을 정부안의 50% 수준으로 결정했습니다.
이 소식은 김민혁 기자입니다.
[리포트]
현재 142명을 선발하는 전북대학교 의과대학.
2025학년도에는 정부 증원 안의 절반인 29명을 늘려 171명을 뽑기로 했습니다.
경북대 의대 역시 정부 증원 안의 절반인 45명만 늘리기로 하면서, 의대 정원을 155명으로 결정했습니다.
지역 거점 국립대 9곳 중 정원을 이번 달 결정하기로 한 전남대를 제외한 8곳은 교육부 증원분의 50% 수준에서 내년도 증원 안을 제출했습니다.
[임상규/경북대학교 교무처장 : "(자율 결정이) 50%에서 100% 사이라고 이 범위는 정해져 있지마는 저희들이 제안한 취지는 좀 줄이자는 취지였으니까, (2025학년도는) 그래서 우리는 50%만 하겠다…."]
반면, 대부분의 사립대는 기존 증원 규모를 유지했습니다.
국립대보다 증원 규모가 작고, 의대 규모가 대학 평판에 미치는 영향도 무시할 수 없기 때문으로 분석됩니다.
[지역 사립대 관계자/음성변조 : "50% 했다가 내년에 또 어떻게 될지 모르니까 일단 정원 받은 만큼 다 하는…."]
다만 이른바 '빅5'병원을 수련병원으로 둔, 울산대와 성균관대는 기존 증원분보다 10명 줄어든 70명씩을 증원하기로 했습니다.
아직 증원 폭을 확정 짓지 못한 일부 대학이 기존 안을 유지할 경우 2025학년도 의대 증원분은 1,500명대 중반이 될 전망입니다.
당초 2천 명 증원 계획보다 400여 명 줄어든 것입니다.
각 대학은 대학교육협의회 심의를 거쳐 이번 달 말까지 신입생 모집요강에 증원분을 반영할 계획입니다.
한편 제주대 등 국립대 의대생 400여 명이 총장 등을 상대로 증원 절차를 멈춰달라며 낸 가처분 신청은 법원에서 기각됐습니다.

이런 가운데 2025학년도 의대 증원 규모는 1,500명대 중반으로 잠정 집계됐습니다.
정부 원안 2천 명 보다 400여 명 줄어든 건데, 의료 공백 사태의 물꼬를 트겠다며 정원 조정안을 제시했던 국립대들이 증원 폭을 정부안의 50% 수준으로 결정했습니다.
이 소식은 김민혁 기자입니다.
[리포트]
현재 142명을 선발하는 전북대학교 의과대학.
2025학년도에는 정부 증원 안의 절반인 29명을 늘려 171명을 뽑기로 했습니다.
경북대 의대 역시 정부 증원 안의 절반인 45명만 늘리기로 하면서, 의대 정원을 155명으로 결정했습니다.

Article: 남성 출산휴가 10일→20일 확대 추진…육아휴직 급여 인상
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
정부가 현재 10일인 배우자, 즉 남성의 유급 출산 휴가를 20일로 확대한다고 예고했습니다.
육아휴직 급여도 단계적으로 늘려가기로 했습니다.
양질의 일자리를 유지해 소득을 늘리도록 돕겠다는 '사회 이동성 강화 대책'인데, 국회를 통과해야 시행할 수 있습니다.
황현규 기자의 보도입니다.
[리포트]
정부가 오늘 발표한 사회 이동성 개선 방안에는 여성 경력단절을 예방하기 위한 구체적인 방안이 담겼습니다.
우선 남성의 유급 출산휴가를 기존 10 근무일에서 20 근무일로 늘리는 방안을 추진합니다.
또 월 150만 원이 상한인 육아휴직 급여를 단계적으로 인상하겠다고 예고했습니다.
육아기 근로시간 단축 대상과 기간, 급여도 확대합니다.
정부는 현재 초등학교 2학년 자녀까지인 대상 기준을 초등학교 6학년 자녀까지로 늘리고, 기간도 부모 1인당 최대 24개월에서 36개월로 연장하겠다고 밝혔습니다.
여성의 근로 소득을 안정적으로 이어가기 위한 대책과 함께 직업계고 청년 지원책도 발표됐습니다.
대학에 진학하지 않고 사회로 나서는 '고졸 청년'들을 위해, 공공기관 경영평가에 반영하는 고졸 채용 비중을 확대합니다.
직업계고 학생들에게는 자격증 취득을 위한 취업준비금을 지급하겠다고 예고했습니다.
이와 함께 미취업 졸업생에게 구직 정보를 주는 직업계고 거점학교도 늘려나가기로 했습니다.
정부는 개인종합자산관리계좌 ISA의 1인 1계좌 제한을 폐지하고 납입과 비과세 한도를 확대하는 안도 사회 이동성 개선방안에 포함했습니다.
다만 이번에 발표된 정책의 상당수는 법 개정이 필요합니다.
정부는 22대 국회에 관련 법 개정안을 제출할 예정이라고 밝혔습니다.

Article: 주택가서 영장 집행 경찰에 총격…경찰 등 4명 사망
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
미국 노스캐롤라이나의 한 주택가에서 영장을 집행하던 경찰과 용의자 간에 총격전이 벌어졌습니다.
3시간 가까이 이어진 대치 상황 끝에 경찰 등 4명이 숨졌습니다.
조혜진 기자가 보도합니다.
[리포트]
주택가에 경찰 장갑차가 들어섭니다.
무장한 경찰들도 곳곳에 배치됐습니다.
곧이어 구급차들도 줄지어 도착했습니다.
현지 시각 지난달 29일 낮, 미국 노스캐롤라이나에서 경찰과 범죄 용의자 간 총격전이 벌어졌습니다.
[리사 레인/목격자 : "처음에는 30초 정도 세 번의 총성이 있었고, 그 다음에는 7번, 그 다음에는 10번의 총성이 있었습니다."]
경찰 등 8명이 병원으로 옮겨졌습니다.
그중 3명이 사망했고, 밤사이 치료를 받던 경찰 1명이 숨져 사망자는 4명으로 늘었습니다.
당시 경찰은 불법 무기 소지 등의 혐의로 영장을 집행하던 중이었습니다.
그런데 한 용의자가 2층에서 경찰을 향해 총을 쏘기 시작했다고 현지 언론들은 보도했습니다.
이후 이 용의자가 총을 들고 집 밖으로 나와 '임박한 치명적 위협'이라고 판단해 사살했다고 경찰은 밝혔습니다.
[케빈 피에트러스/현지 경찰 : "남성 용의자는 총기를 들고 집 밖으로 나갔고, 집 앞마당에서 총에 맞았습니다."]
3시간가량 이어진 대치 끝에 또 다른 용의자 2명은 결국 체포됐습니다.
최근 들어 경찰을 향한 총격 사건 중 가장 피해가 크다는 보도가 나오는 가운데, 지난해 미국에서 근무 중 총격으로 숨지거나 다친 경찰은 모두 378명 역대 최다였습니다.

Article: 최상목 “범부처 ‘민생안정 지원단’ 신설…국민이 공감해야 진짜 회복”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
최상목 경제부총리 겸 기획재정부장관은 오늘(1일) 정부서울청사에서 열린 비상경제장관회의 겸 물가관계장관회의 모두 발언에서 이 같이 밝히며 “현장의 애로사항을 국민의 관점에서 밀착 점검하고 해결 방안을 신속히 강구하는 데 총력을 다하겠다”고 말했습니다.
최 부총리는 오늘 발표된 4월 수출을 언급하며 경기 회복세가 2분기에도 꾸준히 이어지고 있다고 평가했습니다.
그러면서도 지표상 회복 흐름에 안주하지 않겠다며 “국민이 공감해야 진짜 회복이란 점을 명심해 ‘민생경제 회복’에 정책역량을 결집하겠다”고 밝혔습니다.
최상목 부총리는 경제의 역동성을 높이고 체질을 개선하기 위한 ’역동경제 로드맵‘을 다음 달까지 마련하고, 이를 뒷받침하는 재정정책 방향도 재정전략회의에서 논의하겠다고 예고했습니다.
오늘 회의에서는 역동경제의 일환인 ’사회이동성 개선방안‘, 농림축산식품부의 ’농수산물 유통구조 개선방안‘, 문화체육관광부의 ’게임산업 진흥 종합계획‘ 등이 논의됐습니다.
부총리는 사회이동성 개선방안에 대해 “향후 추가과제를 발굴해 역동경제 로드맵에 종합적으로 반영하고, 하반기 중으로 후속대책을 마련하겠다”고 덧붙였습니다.

Article: 검찰, ‘오송 참사’ 김영환 충북지사 소환 조사
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
청주지방검찰청 ‘오송 지하차도 침수사건 수사본부’는 오늘(1일) 김영환 지사를 피의자 신분으로 비공개 소환해 조사하고 있습니다.
참사 유가족 등은 지난해 김영환 지사와 이범석 청주시장, 이상래 전 행정중심복합도시건설청장 등 3명을 중대재해처벌법상 ‘중대시민재해’ 혐의로 고발했습니다.
이 가운데 이범석 시장은 지난달 26일 16시간 가까이 검찰 조사를 받았습니다.
검찰은 김영환 지사를 상대로 참사 당일 행복청 등 관계기관으로부터 미호강 범람 등 위험 연락을 받고도 조치하지 않은 경위, 침수 사고가 난 지하차도의 관리 주체로서 교통 통제를 하지 않은 이유 등을 조사할 것으로 전해졌습니다.
이런 내용 등을 종합해 ‘중대시민재해’ 혐의 적용도 검토할 예정입니다.
김영환 지사에 대한 조사가 마무리되면, 충청북도 담당부서 공무원 등의 기소 여부도 결론이 날 전망입니다.
앞서 지난해 7월 15일, 충북 청주시 오송 궁평 2지하차도가 침수돼 14명이 숨지고 16명이 다쳤습니다.
청주지검은 지난 24일 결심공판에서 미호강 제방을 무단으로 철거하고, 임시 제방을 부실하게 쌓아 지하차도 침수 피해를 키운 혐의로 시공사 현장소장에게 징역 7년 6개월을, 감리단장에게 징역 6년을 구형했습니다.
또 이들의 공사 과정을 제대로 감독하지 않은 행복도시건설청과 금강유역환경청, 미호강 범람 우려 등 신고에도 대응을 제대로 하지 않은 경찰과 소방공무원 등 모두 28명과 법인 2곳도 기소돼 재판을 앞두고 있습니다.

청주지방검찰청 ‘오송 지하차도 침수사건 수사본부’는 오늘(1일) 김영환 지사를 피의자 신분으로 비공개 소환해 조사하고 있습니다.
참사 유가족 등은 지난해 김영환 지사와 이범석 청주시장, 이상래 전 행정중심복합도시건설청장 등 3명을 중대재해처벌법상 ‘중대시민재해’ 혐의로 고발했습니다.
이 가운데 이범석 시장은 지난달 26일 16시간 가까이 검찰 조사를 받았습니다.
검찰은 김영환 지사를 상대로 참사 당일 행복청 등 관계기관으로부터 미호강 범람 등 위험 연락을 받고도 조치하지 않은 경위, 침수 사고가 난 지하차도의 관리 주체로서 교통 통제를 하지 않은 이유 등을 조사할 것으로 전해졌습니다.
이런 내용 등을 종합해 ‘중대시민재해’ 혐의 적용도 검토할 예정입니다.
김영환 지사에 대한 조사가 마무리되면, 충청북도 담당부서 공무원 등의 기소 여부도 결론이 날 전망입니다.
앞서 지난해 7월 15일, 충북 청주시 오송 궁평 2지하차도가 침수돼 14명이 숨지고 16명이 다쳤습니다.
청주지검은 지난 24일 결심공판에서 미호강 제방을 무단으로 철거하고, 임시 제방을 부실하게 쌓아 지하차도 침수 피해를 키운 혐의로 시공사 현장소장에게 징역 7년 6개월을, 감리단장에게 징역 6년을 구형했습니다.
또 이들의 공사 과정을 제대로 감독하지 않은 행복도시건설청과 금강유역환경청, 미호강 범람 우려 등 신고에도 대응을 제대로 하지 않은 경찰과 소방공무원 등 모두 28명과 법인 2곳도 기소돼 재판을 앞두고 있습니다.

Article: 런던에서 흉기 난동…10대 소년 사망, 4명 부상
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
영국 런던 주택가에서 30대 남성이 흉기 난동을 벌여 10대 소년이 숨지고 4명이 다치는 사건이 발생했습니다.
경찰은 일단 테러와는 관련 없는 사건이라 보고 있습니다.
파리 안다영 특파원입니다.
[리포트]
한 남성이 흉기를 들고 주택가를 서성입니다.
출동한 경찰과 대치 중 주택 벽 쪽에 몸을 숨기기도 합니다.
현지 시각 어제 오전 7시쯤 영국 런던 북동부에서 흉기 난동 사건이 벌어졌습니다.
30대 남성이 주택가를 향해 차를 몰고 돌진한 뒤 차에서 내려 지하철역 안팎을 오가며 흉기를 마구 휘둘렀습니다.
이 과정에서 10대 소년이 흉기에 찔려 숨졌습니다.
또 범인과 대치하던 경찰관 2명 등 모두 4명이 다쳐 병원에서 치료 중입니다.
[스튜어트 벨/영국 런던 경찰 : "이번 사건으로 13살 소년이 흉기에 찔려 희생됐습니다. 병원으로 옮겨졌지만 안타깝게도 곧바로 숨졌습니다."]
범인은 현장에서 범행 20여 분 만에 경찰의 테이저건을 맞은 후 검거됐습니다.
목격자들은 범인이 경찰과 대치 중에 경찰을 향해 '신을 믿느냐'고 소리쳤다고 진술했습니다.
또 범인이 흉기를 들고 이 지역을 뛰어다니다 한 집에 들어가려 했지만 실패했고, 그때 경찰이 테이저건을 쐈다고 말했습니다.
런던 경찰은 이번 사건이 테러와는 관련이 없는 것으로 보인다고 밝혔습니다.
또 누군가를 겨냥한 표적 공격도 아닌 것으로 추정했습니다.
경찰은 범인이 부상을 입어 현재 병원에서 치료 중이라 아직 구체적인 범행 동기 등을 조사하지 못했다고 전했습니다.
리시 수낵 총리는 충격적인 사건이라며 피해자와 가족들에게 위로를 전한다고 밝혔습니다.

현지 시각 어제 다우존스 30 산업평균지수는 전장보다 570.17포인트 내린 37,815.92에 거래를 마쳤습니다.
스탠더드앤드푸어스 500 지수는 전장보다 80.48포인트 내렸고, 기술주 중심의 나스닥 지수는 전장보다 325.26포인트 하락했습니다.
4월 한 달간 다우 지수는 전월 대비 4.9% 떨어져 월간 기준으로 2022년 9월 이후 가장 큰 하락 폭을 보였습니다.
시장 전문가들은 연준이 견조한 경제 성장세와 물가 상승 압력을 고려해 이번 회의 이후 이전보다 매파적인 입장 변화를 보일 것으로 예상한 것이 증시 하락에 영향을 끼쳤습니다.

Article: 한-호주 외교·국방장관, 오늘 멜버른서 2+2 회의
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
조태열 외교부 장관과 신원식 국방부 장관, 호주의 리처드 말스 부총리 겸 국방장관, 페니 웡 호주 외교장관이 회의에 참석합니다.
한·호주 2+2 회의는 2021년 9월 서울에서 5차 회의가 열린 이후 2년 8개월 만에 열리는 것입니다. 애초 지난해 10월 개최 예정이었으나 호주 측 사정으로 연기됐습니다.
한국이 장관급에서 정례적으로 '2+2 회의'를 개최하는 국가는 동맹인 미국을 제외하고는 호주가 유일합니다.
호주 국방부는 이번 회의에 대해 "양국의 포괄적 전략 동반자 관계 아래 역내 평화와 번영 도모, 인도·태평양과 전세계적 협력 심화, 국방·안보 협력 관계 증진 등에 대한 공동의 관심을 증진시킬 것"이라고 말했습니다.
이들은 회의에 이어 공동기자회견과 공동오찬을 진행합니다.

Article: 민주당 “주 4.5일제 지원·포괄임금제 금지 추진”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
민주당 황정아 대변인은 오늘(1일) 논평에서 “노동자의 행복한 삶이 곧 민생”이라며 이같이 밝혔습니다.
황 대변인은 “윤석열 정부는 대한민국의 도약을 이끌어 온 노동자들의 자부심을 무너뜨리고 있다”며 “ ‘카르텔’의 낙인을 찍어 노조를 탄압하고, 노란봉투법에 거부권을 행사하며 노동자의 권리를 가로막았다”고 지적했습니다.
또 “주 69시간제를 추진해 노동자의 삶을 망가뜨리려 했고, 노동자의 안전과 생명을 지키기 위한 제도들을 무너뜨리고 있다”며 “청년들의 일자리는 줄어만 가고 노동자들의 살림살이만 나빠지기만 한다”고 했습니다.
이어 “윤석열 대통령과 정부·여당은 총선 민의를 받들어, 반(反) 노동 정책을 전환하기 바란다”며 “민주당은 노동자들이 흘린 땀 한 방울, 한 방울의 가치가 제대로 인정되고 존중받는 대한민국을 만들겠다”고 덧붙였습니다.
그러면서 “대한민국이 최빈국에서 세계 경제강국으로 도약하는 데는 노동자들의 땀과 눈물이 있었다”며 “그 노고와 헌신에 존경과 감사의 말씀을 드린다”고 덧붙였습니다.
노동절은 1886년 5월 1일 미국 시카고에 이어, 1890년 같은 날 세계 각국 노동자들이 열악한 노동환경과 적은 보수에 맞서 ‘만국의 노동자여 단결하라’며 연대했던 것을 기리는 날로, 우리나라는 법정기념일 ‘근로자의 날’로 기념하고 있습니다.

기록적인 엔화 약세로 인해 일본에서는 외국인 관광객이 급증하고 있지만 정작 자국민들의 해외 여행은 쉽지 않은 상황입니다.
[리포트]
도쿄에서 한 시간 거리인 사이타마현 가와고에시.
요즘 외국인 관광객들이 급증하고 있습니다.
[외국인 관광객 : "엔화 약세 때문에 일본에 왔어요. 쇼핑과 관광도 하기 좋고, 비용대비 효과가 좋아요."]
나무 젓가락 만들기 체험 가게입니다.
외국인 관광객 중 절반 이상이 가장 비싼 코스를 고르고 있습니다.
하지만 일본인 관광객 입장에서는 이런 엔화 약세가 마냥 반갑지만은 않습니다.
하와이를 여행 중인 이 일본인 부부는 비싼 커피 값과 음식 가격에 깜짝 놀랐다고 합니다.
[이노우에 유리 : "하와이 여행 중 깜짝 놀랐어요. 쉽게 지불할 수 있는 가격이 아니었어요."]
이들은 식사비라도 아끼기 위해 아침 겸 점심을 먹거나 일본에서 가져온 인스턴트 식품으로 식사를 대체하고 있다고 합니다.

Article: 파리 올해 최고의 바게트 장인 뽑혀
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
프랑스인들에게 바게트는 단순히 빵을 넘어 하나의 문화적 상징인데요.
그에 걸맞게 파리시와 제과제빵협회에서는 1994년부터 해마다 파리 최고의 바게트 장인을 뽑는 대회를 열고 있습니다.
네트리씨는 자신의 25년 제빵사 경력에 최고의 영예라고 말합니다.
[네트리/제빵사 : "25년간 이 일을 하면서 전부터 바라던 상을 받게 돼 정말 기쁩니다."]
소식이 알려지자 주민들은 물론 관광객들까지 빵집은 손님들로 가득합니다.
[리튼/미국인 관광객 : "겉은 따뜻하고 바삭바삭하지만 속은 쫄깃하고 말랑해 아주 맛있네요."]
최고의 바게트 장인으로 뽑히면 대통령궁에 바게트를 납품하게 됩니다.
[본옴므/인근 주민 : "마크롱 대통령이 먹게 될 바게트가 궁금해 찾아왔습니다."]
전통 바게트는 밀가루와 물, 소금, 그리고 효모 이 네 가지 재료만 가지고 길이 50~55cm, 무게 250~270g, 규격으로 만드는데요.
반죽의 발효와 굽기 등 모든 것이 최상의 조화를 이뤄 균형 잡힌 맛과 향을 내기까지는 고도의 기술이 필요합니다.

[네트리/제빵사 : "25년간 이 일을 하면서 전부터 바라던 상을 받게 돼 정말 기쁩니다."]
소식이 알려지자 주민들은 물론 관광객들까지 빵집은 손님들로 가득합니다.
[리튼/미국인 관광객 : "겉은 따뜻하고 바삭바삭하지만 속은 쫄깃하고 말랑해 아주 맛있네요."]
최고의 바게트 장인으로 뽑히면 대통령궁에 바게트를 납품하게 됩니다.
[본옴므/인근 주민 : "마크롱 대통령이 먹게 될 바게트가 궁금해 찾아왔습니다."]
전통 바게트는 밀가루와 물, 소금, 그리고 효모 이 네 가지 재료만 가지고 길이 50~55cm, 무게 250~270g, 규격으로 만드는데요.
반죽의 발효와 굽기 등 모든 것이 최상의 조화를 이뤄 균형 잡힌 맛과 향을 내기까지는 고도의 기술이 필요합니다.

Article: 중국, 무중력 우주에서 물고기 키우기
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
중국이 얼마 전 쏘아 올린 선저우 18호 유인 우주선에 물고기를 실어 보냈습니다.
[리포트]
중국은 중국이 만든 우주정거장 톈궁을 활용해 과학 연구를 수행할 방침입니다.
이번에 쏘아 올린 유인우주선 ‘선저우 18호’의 또 다른 임무는 물고기 실험입니다.
우주정거장 실험 모듈에 수족관을 만들어 최초로 무중력 상태에서 물고기를 키우는 일을 시도합니다.
미세중력 상태에서 일어나는 골 손실을 연구하기 위해 열대어인 제브라피시를 선택했습니다.
[장타오/중국과학원 : "소형 생태환경 시스템입니다. 물고기 외에도 산소 발생기와 수초 같은 다른 생물도 있습니다."]
우주인이 데려간 물고기는 모두 네 마리.
크기가 5cm 정도로 작은 열대어 제브라피시는 한 번에 200∼300여 개의 알을 낳을 정도로 번식력이 높습니다.
또 유전자의 90%가 인간과 일치해 동물실험에 흔히 사용된다고 합니다.

Article: 독일, 간병인 업무 덜어 주는 로봇 개발 한창
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
초고령화 사회로 접어들면서 도움이 필요한 고령층 인구도 가파르게 늘고 있는데요.
독일에선 간병인 구하기가 점점 힘들어지는 가운데, 간병인 업무를 덜어주는 로봇도 속속 등장하고 있습니다.
[리포트]
머지않은 장래에 독일의 병원이나 요양시설 등에서 일상이 될 모습입니다.
아헨공과대학교 연구진이 아헨대학병원과 함께 개발한 로봇인데요, 누워 있는 환자를 옆으로 눕혀주거나 몸을 들어줄 수 있습니다.
사전에 입력된 환자 정보를 토대로 환자의 어느 부위를 만져야 하는지 자동으로 파악해 조심스럽게 환자를 움직입니다.
[지베르트/아헨공과대학교 프로젝트 책임자 : "허리 통증 환자들이 많습니다. 이 로봇은 환자의 발을 들어주거나 옆으로 돌려 눕혀줌으로써 환자의 신체적 압박을 줄여줄 수 있습니다."]
하루에도 수십 번씩 환자들을 돌려 눕히고, 앉히고, 다시 눕히고 하는 일도 간병인들에게는 적잖은 육체적 부담이 됩니다.
로봇이 이 일을 덜어주기만 해도 간병인들은 한숨 돌릴 여유가 생깁니다.
고령 인구 증가로 간병인 수요도 급증함에 따라 독일에선 2040년이면 무려 70만 명 가까운 간병인이 부족할 것으로 예상되는 가운데, 다양한 업무 보조를 위해 로봇을 활용하려는 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있습니다.

대형 크루즈선에서 관광객들이 끊임없이 쏟아져 나옵니다.
중국 노동절 연휴를 맞아 중국인 단체 관광객, 이른바 유커들이 대거 제주를 찾은 것입니다.
노동절 연휴에 중국 크루즈선이 제주에 온 건 코로나 19사태 이후 처음입니다.

Article: 류현진, KBO 100승 금자탑…노시환 땅 짚고 만루포
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
프로야구 한화의 에이스 류현진이 SSG전에서 6이닝 2실점 호투로 KBO리그 통산 100승을 달성했습니다.
4번 타자 노시환도 역전 만루포를 터뜨리는 등 공수에서 맹활약을 펼치며 류현진의 특급 도우미 역할을 했습니다.
하무림 기자의 보도입니다.
[리포트]
류현진의 100승 도전을 맞아 대전 한화 이글스 파크는 16경기 연속 매진 신기록을 세우며 뜨거운 열기를 뿜어냈습니다.
11년만에 한국에서 다시 만난 추신수와 첫 승부에선 공격적인 투구로, 헛스윙 삼진을 잡아낸 장면이 압권이었습니다.
노시환은 먼저 수비에서 류현진의 어깨를 가볍게 했습니다.
2회 1,2루 위기에서 이지영의 내야 안타성 타구를 아웃으로 잡아냈고, 4회 또 한번 찾아온 위기의 순간, 허슬 플레이로 3루 베이스를 찍으며 류현진을 도왔습니다.
그동안 ABS에 불만을 나타냈던 류현진은 103개의 공을 던지는 동안 삼진은 1개 밖에 없었지만 특유의 제구력으로 6이닝 2실점, 역사적인 100승 요건을 달성했습니다.
수비요정이었던 노시환은 앞서 들어온 몸쪽 슬라이더를 헛스윙했지만, 곧이어 똑같은 코스로 공이 오자, 기다렸다는듯 만루포를 쏘아올렸습니다.
마치 골프 스윙같은 어퍼컷 스윙에 오른손으로 바닥을 짚는 진기한 동작으로 타구를 지켜봤는데, 경기를 한방에 뒤집는 역전 만루포가 됐습니다.
짜릿한 홈런에 열광한 대전 홈팬들과는 달리, 류현진은 덤덤한 표정으로 눈길을 끌었습니다.
한화는 공수에서 만점 활약을 펼친 노시환의 활약으로 SSG에 완승을 거뒀고, 류현진은 KBO리그 통산 100승의 감격을 맛봤습니다.
[류현진/한화 : "대전에서 홈 팬들 앞에서 달성해서 좀 더 뜻깊은 것 같고, 좋았던 것 같아요. 그런 거(케이크 축하)를 처음 받아봐서 기분 좋았었던 순간이었던 것 같아요."]
류현진은 한미 프로야구 통산 승수 역시 178승으로 늘렸습니다.

한 주간의 대중 문화 소식을 정리하는 주간, 대중문화 순서입니다.
KBS 뮤직뱅크가 이번에는 유럽의 중심, 벨기에에서 현지 녹화 공연을 진행했습니다.
MC 박보검을 선두로 투모로우바이투게더 등 최정상 케이팝 그룹들이 총출동했는데, 해외 팬들의 떼창으로 공연장이 뜨거웠다고 합니다.
그 현장부터 가보시죠, 임재성 기자입니다.
[리포트]
이번에는 벨기에가 케이팝으로 물들었습니다.
KBS 뮤직뱅크 월드투어 18번째 공연.
["This is Park Bo Gum."]
뮤뱅 31대 MC 배우 박보검이 진행을 맡았습니다.
투모로우바이투게더부터 라이즈, 스테이씨, (여자)아이들, 원어스, 제로베이스원까지.
최정상 케이팝 그룹 6팀이 해외 팬들을 만났습니다.
["여러분 다들 신나계 즐기고 계신가요?"]
현지 공연장에 몰린 관객만 만 9천여 명, 한글로 쓴 메시지에, 무대마다 한국말 떼창이 울려 퍼졌습니다.
특히 이번 공연에서는 MC 박보검이 스페셜 무대에 참여해 피아노 연주를 선보였습니다.
'뮤직뱅크 인 벨기에' 공연 실황은 오는 4일 밤 10시 35분 KBS 2TV를 통해 방송됩니다.
하이브와 어도어 소속사 간 갈등 속에도 그룹 뉴진스가 굳건한 인기를 이어가고 있습니다.
["하나, 둘, 셋, 넷."]
뉴진스는 지난달 27일 신곡 '버블 검'의 뮤직비디오를 공개했습니다.
이 뮤직비디오는 공개 하루 만에 천백만 조회 수를 기록했고, 뉴진스를 응원하는 7만 개 넘는 댓글이 달렸습니다.
뉴진스의 새 앨범은 오는 24일 발매됩니다.
2015년 발매된 BTS 앨범 화양연화를 기반으로 한 드라마가 제작됐습니다.

▶ 손정혜 : 안녕하세요. 손정혜입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 이번 사건을 들여다보면 상당히 복잡합니다. 청취자분들 이해를 돕기 위해서 사건이 어떻게 진행됐는지 좀 간단히 정리를 해 주세요.
▶ 손정혜 : 일단 하이브라는 회사가 있고요. 하이브가 전액 출자해서 만든 회사가 어도어라는 회사입니다. 이 어도어의 대표가 이제 민희진 대표가 되겠고 현재 이 민희진 대표와 대주주, 지배주주인 하이브 간에 이제 갈등과 의사 충돌이 있다 이렇게 보시면 될 것 같고요. 그 과정에서 하이브는 이제 민희진 대표 이하 이사진에 대한 경영진에 대한 불신임을 지금 표하면서 지배주주, 대주주로서 이 민희진 대표를 대표이사직에서 해임하는 절차를 진행하고 있는 사건입니다. 그 과정에서 뭐 카피 논란도 있었던 것이고 또는 이제 주식 계약을 통해서 풋옵션 금액을 올려달라는 과정에서 협상이 불발됐다는 이야기도 있고 또 민희진 대표 측에서 이렇게 지금 하이브가 오히려 우리를 업무방해를 한다는 주장도 있고 하이브는 또 민희진 대표가 경영권을 탈취하려는 목적으로 일련의 과정들을 실행했다 서로 이제 공격하고 있는 상황이라고 보시면 되겠습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 이번에 등장한 생소한 용어가 레이블입니다. 하이브의 레이블 가운데 하나가 어도어고 민희진 대표는 어도어의 대표입니다. 일종의 자회사 같은 개념인데 엔터테인먼트 업계 특성상 레이블이라는 용어를 특별히 사용하는 건지 아니면 법적으로 자회사와 조금 다른 게 있는 건지 궁금합니다. 어떻습니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 레이블은 법률 용어는 전혀 아니고요. 일단 이 엔터테인먼트 측에서 예전에는 한 회사가 굉장히 다양한 아티스트를 한 회사가 모두 다 소속하고 있었잖아요. 그런데 그러다 보니까 독과점이라든가 경영 리스크가 분산되지 않는 문제가 있으니 예를 들면 하이브 같은 경우도 BTS는 다른 회사에서 소속하고 있고 뉴진스도 다른 법인을 세워서 이제 독립적으로 운영을 하기 위한 시도인데 레이블이라는 단어는 라벨이라고 생각하시면 편할 것 같습니다, 라벨링 할 때 라벨.
▷ 전종철 : Lable 그거예요?
▶ 손정혜 : 표, 소속의 표시 출처, 표지.
▷ 전종철 : Rable인가 혼자서 생각하고 있었어요.
▶ 손정혜 : 이 아티스트의 소속사를 이야기하는 거죠. 큰 모회사는 하이브이고 그 밑에 있는 작은 작은 자회사들이 모여서 이 큰 아티스트의 어떤 기업군을 형성하는 것인데 그래서 이 레이블이라는 건 그 아티스트들의 소속과 분류, 소속사를 이야기한다고 생각하시면 좀 쉽습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 경영상의 효율성 그다음에 리스크 분산 말씀해 주셨고요. 민희진 대표는 하이브의 다른 레이블, 빌리프랩에서 데뷔한 아이돌 아일릿이 뉴진스를 카피했다 이에 대해서 항의하자 하이브가 자신을 쫓아내려 하고 있다고 이제 주장하고 있습니다. 그런데 그동안 표절이라고 하면 우리가 보통 뭐 음악, 노래 베낀 게 전통적인 표절인데 이번에 어도어는 아일릿이 뉴진스의 헤어, 메이크업, 의상, 안무, 행사 출연 등 연예 활동 모든 영역에서 카피했다 이렇게 주장하고 있습니다. 이 같은 부분도 지적 재산권에 해당이 되나요?
▶ 손정혜 : 일반적으로는 이런 메이크업이나 의상 이런 소위 말하는 콘셉트라는 것은 사실 한정적인 영역이기 때문에 이런 아이디어 자체를 지적재산권으로 보장해 줄 수 없습니다. 이걸 지적재산권으로 보장해 주면 무슨 문제가 있냐면 예를 들면 우리가 예전에 핑클을 따라 했던 일반인들 많잖아요, 의상도 무대도 옷도. 그걸 따라 못하는 거죠, 저작권 위반이 되기 때문에. 단순한 어떤 메이크업이라든가 안무 같은 경우는 실제로는 저작권으로 보호하기는 어려운 아이디어 수준이나 콘셉트에 해당할 여지가 있고 다만 이제 부정경쟁방지법 이런 데 보면 너무 알려져서 그 자체가 재산적 가치가 되는 경우가 있거든요. 이런 콘셉트나 이런 내용들을 총합했을 때 그 사람의 퍼블리시티권을 침해할 정도, 그 정도의 복제본이 발생을 했다고 한다면 법률적인 이슈가 이야기될 수 있는데 많이 아시다시피 걸그룹이든 아티스트들이 비슷한 콘셉트를 유지하면서 조금 변형해가면서 성장해 왔거든요, 걸그룹의 역사가. 그래서 현재의 주장만으로는 지적재산권이라든가 부정경쟁방지법이라든가 이것을 위반했다고 보기는 조금 부족합니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그렇군요. 그러면 큰 틀에서 보면 뉴진스도 아일릿도 하이브 소속 아티스트라고 이제 볼 수 있는데요. 그러면 일종의 표절 논란이 발생했을 때 그 대상이 완전히 소속사가 다른 경우와 좀 다르지 않을까. 이번처럼 소속사가 같거나 관계 있는 경우는 법적으로 좀 차이가 있나요?
▶ 손정혜 : 사실은 법률적으로는 각각의 개별적인 독립된 회사니까 조금 다른, 대주주가 같다고 해서 일치된 의견이 나오지 않을 수 있는데 그럼에도 불구하고 주식회사는 주주가, 그러니까 주식을 소유함으로 인해서 소유 관계가 발생하잖아요. 하이브도 내 회사고 지금 말씀하신 어도어도 내 회사고 아일릿이 소유한 것도 대부분 지배주주는 같다고 한다면 경제적 이해관계가 동일하죠. 그래서 사실 이런 경우에는 표절 문제가 크게 발생하지 않는데 이번에 어도어와 하이브 간에 갈등이 이제 생기면서 사실은 이 문제보다는 다른 원인 때문에 더 갈등이 악화될 수 있을 것 같은데요.
▷ 전종철 : 돈 문제 아니냐, 예컨대.
▶ 손정혜 : 아티스트들이 워낙에 이제 관심을 많이 받는 주체다 보니 이런 아티스트 표절 논란까지 제기된 것으로 보이는데 일각에서는 지난해 12월에 민 대표와 하이브 간의 주주 간 계약서에 대한 재협상이 요구되면서 갈등이 시작했다고 분석을 하거든요. 왜냐하면 여기 보면 하이브가 민 대표에게 한 20%의 주식을 주면서 그 당시 시세로 35억 정도.
▷ 전종철 : 지금 한 18% 갖고 있는 것 같아요.
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 2%는 직원들한테 줬기 때문인데요. 그 18%에 대한 풋옵션. 그러니까 내가 어느 시점에 이것을 팔 때 그 당시 영업이익의 13배를 주겠다는 게 이 계약의 주요 요지인데 민 대표 측에서 30배를 올려달라 이렇게 주장을 했다는 보도가 나오고 있거든요. 현재 기준 영업이익만으로는 한 13배면 1천억 정도의 가치, 30배면 2,700억 가치로 평가가 된다고 하니까 이게 사실은 최소 수백억에서 천억 단위의 경제적인 이해관계에 대한 불일치 싸움이다 이렇게 보셔야 됩니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그러니까 어떻게 보면 결국 돈 문제인데 나머지 것들은 그 돈 문제를 포장하기 위한 어떤 구실일 수도 있겠네요. 제가 단정적으로 말씀드리는 건 아닙니다.
▶ 손정혜 : 돈이 큰 문제일 수 있고 또 아티스트를 어떻게 이제 운영하고 어떻게 이제 활동할지는 세부적으로 경영진의 의사가 다를 수는 있는 거죠.
▷ 전종철 : 뭐 그것도 중요하기는 하지만. 하이브는 민희진 대표가 경영권을 탈취하려고 했다면서 배임으로 고발했습니다. 그런데 하이브는 어도어 지분 지금 80%를 갖고 있어요. 그렇다면 하이브 측은 민 대표가 경영권을 어떻게 탈취하려 했다고 하는 건가요?
▶ 손정혜 : 그러니까 결국은 이제 하이브에 대한 주식 가치를 조금 떨어뜨리거나 여러 가지 방법으로 인해서 하이브가 이 지분을 매각하도록 유도한다는 취지인데 결국 경영권을 확보하려면 지분을 가져와야 되잖아요, 사든지 어떠한 방식이든지. 구체적인 내용까지 나오고 있지 않지만 어찌 됐든 하이브로부터 좀 독립된 경영권을 가지고자 어도어의 지분을 좀 늘리려는 시도는 있었던 것 같습니다. 의사의 어떤 표현이라고 해야 될까요? 그런데 어떤 회사를 운영하면서 내가 한 18% 주주인데 좀 더 지분을 늘리고자 한다, 우호적인 지분을 만들고자 한다는 건 통상 있을 수 있는 일이기 때문에 그게 불법은 아닙니다. 다만 이렇게 지분을 매수하려는 계획에서 불법적인 수단을 동원한다. 예를 들면 시세 조작을 통해서 시세를 떨어뜨려서 사온다거나 이런 것들은 불법이겠죠. 일단 하이브는 경영권을 탈취하려고 했고 그거는 영업 비밀을 유출한다든가 계약서 이야기가 나오고 있거든요. 그리고 부적절한 어떤 컨설팅을 받고 있다 이런 것들이 불법이다라고 주장하고 있는 상황입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 이 부분은 어떠세요? 경영권 탈출 시도가 좀 있다 하더라도 이 경우에 배임 미수도 아니고 계획 단계일 뿐이다. 그래서 법적으로 책임 물을 수 없다 이런 얘기도 나오거든요.
▶ 손정혜 : 지금 지배적인 의견으로는 업무상 배임죄라는 것은 결국은 대표이사로서 어도어에는 손해를 끼치고 나한테는 이익을 끼칠 수 있는 어떻게 보면 배신적 행위가 구체적으로 특정이 돼서 구체적으로 실행을 했어야 되는데.
▷ 전종철 : 실행, 그렇죠?
▶ 손정혜 : 실행에 나아가지도 않았을 뿐만 아니라 지금 문제된 내용이 어떤 대외비에, 그러니까 외부에 공개돼서는 안 되는 계약서를 가지고 투자를 유치하려고 했다는 거거든요. 그런데 이 투자를 유치한다는 거는 어도어한테는 손해가 아니죠, 투자를 받는 거니까. 그러니까 결국은 배임의 구성 요건이라고 하는 손해를 발생하려는 구체적인 계획과 실행이 현재로서는 확인되지 않아서 지금 업무상 배임으로 고발을 했다고 하더라도 처벌 여부는 매우 불확실하다라고 볼 수 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 하이브가 어도어 측의 경영진 교체를 위한 이사회 열어달라고 요청했는데 민 대표 이를 거부했습니다. 그러자 하이브는 임시 주주총회 열겠다면서 법원에 개최 허가 신청했습니다. 보통 임시 주주총회 열 때 법원 개최 허가를 보통 득하나요?
▶ 손정혜 : 원래 주총은 이사회의 권한이기 때문에 이사회의 의장인 민 대표가 열어야 되는데 민 대표가 안 열어주는 경우가 있을 수 있으니 그러면 상법에서는 3% 이상의 주주가 우리는 이런이런 안건으로 주총을 하겠습니다. 법원 허가해 주십시오라고 하면 법원이 결정으로 열어줄 수 있는 절차가 있거든요. 이건 소수 주주를 보호하기 위한 제도입니다. 그래서 특별한 사유 없으면 허가 결정이 나오고 임시주총까지 나아갈 가능성 매우 높고요. 다만 현재 어도어 측에서도 우리가 5월 말쯤에 열겠다 이렇게 의사표시를 하고 있어서 주총이 열릴 건데요. 주총의 안건은 명확하게 대표이사 이사들의 해임 안건이 올라올 겁니다. 그래서 사실 여기서 지분 경쟁을 해야 되는데 이미 80%를 하이브가 갖고 있기 때문에 어떤 의결권 행사에 하이브를 막을 수 있는 수단은 현재로서는 별로 없다.
▷ 전종철 : 그래요? 막을 수 없어서 임시 주주총회 통해서 대표직에서 이제 민 대표가 해임이 되면 어떤 그 차후에 대표직을 되찾을 방법은 있습니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 예를 들면 법률적으로 이 주총 결의가 무효다, 취소다라고 하면서 다툴 수 있는 수단은 있지만 실질적으로 주식회사의 주인은 주주라고 말씀드렸잖아요. 무려 80%, 3분의 2 이상을 가지고 있는 대주주가 우리는 해임하겠다고 하면 법률상 크게 불복할 수는 없을 겁니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그렇군요. 그동안 연예계 분쟁 하면 주로 소속사하고 아티스트 사이의 전속 계약이라든지 이런 문제였던 것 같아요, 대부분은. 그런데 최근에 경영권 분쟁이 자주 이제 눈에 띄고 이렇듯이요. 지난해에는 또 SM엔터테인먼트도 경영권 분쟁 겪지 않았습니까? 최근에 기획사 내부에서 이렇게 경영권 분쟁 잦아지게 된 이유 뭐라고 보세요?
▶ 손정혜 : 그만큼 우리 한국 시장의 엔터테인먼트, 연예기획사들의 경제적 가치가 매우 높아졌다는 거죠. 하나의 산업군이 되었을 뿐만 아니라 SM 경영권 분쟁에서 볼 수 있는 게 이수만 회장이 14.8%를 경영권 프리미엄을 얹어서 하이브에게 매각을 했는데 그 금액이 3,300억대입니다. 수천억대의 가치를 가지고 있기 때문에 싸움이 날 수밖에 없죠. 워낙 큰 가치가 있고.
▷ 전종철 : 먹을 게 커지니까 싸움도 생긴다?
▶ 손정혜 : 그렇습니다. 그리고 이 경영권을 확보하는 게.
▷ 전종철 : 집안하고 비슷하네요.
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 이익과 충돌될 수밖에 없으니까. 예를 들면 수십억이다 그러면 협의도 있고 하지만 수천억대는 이해관계자들이 너무 많겠죠. 그런 어떻게 보면 성장을 하는 성장통이라고도 보실 수 있겠습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 제 지인은 뭐 이런 얘기를 하더라고요. 집안에 재산이 30억 이하면 괜찮은데 30억 넘어갈 때 형제간에 분쟁이 생긴다 뭐 이런 얘기도 하던데 여하튼 파이가 커지니까 분쟁의 소지도 크다 그렇게 이제 이해가 됩니다. 지난해 SM엔터테인먼트 경영권 분쟁은 또 구체적으로 어떻게 진행됐고 또 어떻게 마무리가 됐습니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 아직까지 법률적으로는 종결되지 않은 사건들이 있습니다. 수사도 관련돼서 진행되고 있어서. 다만 카카오가 9% 매입하면서 이수만 회장의 경영권에 대한 도전이 있었고 이수만 회장은 이 경영권 프리미엄을 얹어서 또 하이브한테 매각을 했고. 그래서 어느 정도 지분 정리는 끝나 있는 상황이다. 경영권은 지금 어찌 됐든 대주주는 하이브한테 넘어간 상황이다라고 일단락됐다고 하지만 주식의 분포라는 게 대주주가 14.8%, 그러니까 압도적인 지분을 갖고 있지 않거든요. 그래서 항상 어느 사회나 어느 조직이나 경영권 분쟁은 남아 있다 이렇게 보실 수 있겠죠.
▷ 전종철 : 그럼 또 조금 다른 질문을 드려볼게요. 이번 사태가 진행되는 과정에서 하이브 측이 민희진 대표 측의 컴퓨터를 조사해서 카카오톡 대화 내용과 자료 이거를 확보한 것으로 알려졌습니다. 경찰이 하거나 그런 게 아니에요. 지금 회사 측이 한 겁니다. 그런데 하이브가 대주주이긴 하지만 민희진 대표가 소속 직원 개념은 아닌 것 같고 설사 소속 직원이라고 해도 회사가 컴퓨터에 저장된 자료를 조사할 수 있나 이런 논란이 생길 수 있거든요. 이게 법적으로는 어떻게 됩니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 일단은 하이브 측에서는 감사의 권한으로 이렇게 이제 사실관계를 했다고 주장할 여지는 있겠지만 일반적으로 카톡이라는 건 내밀한 개인 정보이기 때문에 이것을 권한 없이 열어본다든가 이것을 공개하는 것은 정보통신망법이나 개인정보법 위반이 될 여지가 있거든요.
▷ 전종철 : 그게 아마 수사기관도 그냥 막 뒤지는 게 아니라 어떤 영장이 필요하잖아요.
▶ 손정혜 : 영장이 있어야 되죠. 그래서 민희진 대표가 적극적으로 동의해서 제출한 자료가 아니면 이 자체의 자료 확보 과정에 불법성은 문제될 여지는 있고요. 다만 민 대표가 이것까지는 이제 문제를 삼거나 그러지는 않는 것 같습니다. 본인이 또 스스로 기자회견에서 본인도 이제 카톡 내용을 공개한 적도 있고.
▷ 전종철 : 그 내용에 대해서 부정을 한 건 아니고. 그렇죠?
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 그래서 이런 이슈는 이렇게 작게 작게 어떤 소송에 들어가면 문제가 될 여지는 있지만 큰 틀을 좌지우지할 수 있는 내용은 아니기 때문에 향후 이 부분도 공방이 되는지 지켜봐야 될 것 같습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그건 약간 부가적인 지엽적인 문제네요, 현재로서는.
▶ 손정혜 : 지엽적이죠.
▷ 전종철 : 나중에 모든 전면전으로 가면 이게 이것도 또 언급이 포함돼서 될 수는 있는 그 정도라고 이해하면 되겠네요. 또 이제 확보한 자료 가운데 일부가 공개됐습니다. 자료 확보하는 것과 확보된 자료 공개하는 건 또 법적으로 다를 수 있을 것 같아요. 이 부분은 어떻게 봐야 됩니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 그러니까 자료를 공개함으로 인해서 이 자료의 공개의 내용이 그 사람의 어떤 명예훼손이나 이런 것들을 심각하게 침해하는 경우가 있을 수 있거든요. 언론을 통해서 공개를 하는 거니까요. 그런 점에 있어서는 예를 들면 명예훼손이나 이런 걸로 이제 처벌받을 가능성이 있는데 항상 이제 공공의 이익을 목적으로 했다, 방어권 차원이었다라고 한다면 또 처벌까지 가지 않는 경우도 상당 부분 있습니다. 지금 양쪽에서 여론전을 펼치면서 유리한 자료를 발췌해서 제출하잖아요. 사실은 발췌된 자료 중에 상대방에 대해서 악의적으로 비방하는 내용이 있거나 욕설이 있으면 법률적으로는 처벌 소지도 있고 위법하다고 평가될 소지가 있는데 항상 여론전을 개개별로 또 고소고발해서 처벌하는 경우는 없고 결국은 큰 분위기 전환을 시도하려는 의사이기 때문에 큰 쟁점이 해소되면 이 부분들은 또 묻히는 경우도 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그렇죠, 아주 줄기는 아니니까 이게. 민희진 대표 기자회견도 주목을 받았습니다. 민 대표의 격정 토로에 진정성이 느껴졌다, 공감된다 이런 인터넷상의 평가도 있었고요. 반면에 기자회견에서 비속어나 너무 거친 표현은 적절치 않았다는 지적도 있습니다. 솔직히 같은 여성으로서 좀 통쾌함 같은 거 느끼셨어요, 안 느끼셨어요?
▶ 손정혜 : 좀 생소하고 신선한 기자회견이었지만 좀 저는 변호사니까.
▷ 전종철 : 부담됐어요?
▶ 손정혜 : 이게 본인한테 법률적으로 이익이나 그런...
▷ 전종철 : 그것부터 먼저 보여요?
▶ 손정혜 : 생각이 들었는데 그래도 여론을 바꾸는 데는 굉장히 주요했다고 보입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 이게 약간 어필을 한 것 같아요.
▶ 손정혜 : 특히 젊은 층에서 이렇게 할 말 다 하고 준비하지 않고 기자회견에서 쌍욕, 비속어 막 나오는 기자회견 처음 본 거거든요.
▷ 전종철 : 그런데 그렇게까지 얘기하는데 저게 거짓말일까, 과연. 그렇죠?
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 그 억울함이 좀 전달됐다 이런 의견도 좀 많은 것 같고 할 말 다 하는 사람이다라는 평가도 있는 반면에 옆에 양쪽에 변호사님이 얼굴을 못 뜨는 장면이 있거든요.
▷ 전종철 : 아이고, 아이고 하고 막.
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 이거는 법률적으로 불리할 수 있는 소지도 있는데 그렇게 했다라는 부분에서는 이 기자회견을 둘러싼 의견도 굉장히 좀 갈리고 있는 것 같습니다. 재미있는 광경이기는 합니다.
▷ 전종철 : 변호사시니까 민 대표가 공개적으로 이제 말하다 보니까 특정인들을 계속 저격했단 말이에요, 공개된 장소에서. 물론 기자회견에서 지금 누구를 저격할 수밖에 없는 구조이긴 하지만 그게 법적으로 어떤 문제가 됩니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 원래는 모욕과 명예훼손을 검토해 볼 수 있어요. 막 쌍욕도 나오고 했으니까요. 근데 문제는 제가 이제 손정혜니까 손정혜라고 하면서 탁탁탁탁 욕설을 쓴 게 아니라 그냥 욕설만 나왔거든요. 이게 혼잣말의 욕설인지 누구를 향해서 이런 욕설을 했는지에 대한 특정성이 좀 부족하더라고요. 예를 들면 하이브 누구가 OOOOO 이렇게 욕을 한 것이 아니어서요. 그래서 실질적으로는.
▷ 전종철 : 법적으로 문제가 좀 덜 될 수 있어요?
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 특정이 되어야 되죠. 누구를 모욕했는지가 좀 불명확해서 일단은 성립 여지는 있지만 현재로서는 특정성이 좀 부족해 보이고 혼자서 한탄해서 혼자서 이제 화가 나서 하는 비속어도 일부 있더라고요. 그 정도만으로는 처벌까지 가지 않을 것 같고 하이브 측에서도 이것 자체를 이제 고소고발하려고는 하지 않을 것이고 다만 대표이사 해임하거나 여러 가지 민사 소송 과정에서 이런 부적절한 태도가 있었다라고 어필할 걸로 보입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 전반적인 상황을 보면 하이브와 민희진 대표는 이제 결별 수순은 밟고 있는 것 같고요. 그런데 이 경우에 하이브와 어도어의 결별보다는 민희진 대표가 대표직에서 해임될 가능성이 크다 이런 얘기가 나오고 있거든요. 실제로 그런 약간 수순으로 가고 있다고 보세요?
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 대표이사 해임 안건을 통과시킬 만한 80%의 지분을 확보하고 있는 하이브는 민희진 대표를 해임하려는 생각이 굉장히 확고해졌을 가능성이 있고요. 그 이후에 이제 절차는 민희진 대표가 가지고 있는 주식을 어떻게 평가해서 권리를 행사할 것이냐. 민사 소송이 진행되겠죠. 주식에 대한 가치나 손해배상 청구에 대한 양방 공방이 이루어질 것이고 대표직을 해임하는 이 결의도 위법하다라고 민희진 대표는 다툴 수 있습니다. 그래서 소송이 장기화될 가능성이 있습니다. 최소 6개월, 1년 이상 법률적인 다툼은 계속 진행될 여지가 있고요. 다만 여론이 안 좋아지거나 아티스트들한테 해가 된다고 한다면 법정에서 정리가 되는 게 아니라 쌍방 합의에 이를 가능성은 여전히 있죠. 팬들은 합의했으면 좋겠다 이런 생각을 갖고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 팬들의 가장 큰 관심은 마지막 질문입니다. 이거 만약에 해임되면 뉴진스 어떻게 되는 거지? 이게 걱정일 것 같아요.
▶ 손정혜 : 민희진 대표라는 한 사람이 없다고 하더라도 뉴진스가 활동을 못하지는 않기 때문에 지금 이 사태에도 불구하고 뉴진스의 공개 행보는 굉장히 긍정적인 평가를 받고 있거든요. 다만 이 사태가 악화돼서 서로 더 공방전이 이루어진다고 한다면 아티스트의 명예나 이미지가 안 좋아지겠죠. 거기까지 가면 안 된다라는 측면이고요. 뉴진스도 이제 계약 기간이 있습니다, 어도어하고 언제까지 계약. 그 이후에 이제 뉴진스는 어디로 갈 것인가의 문제죠. 아직 시간적인 부분이 있는데 더 신뢰하는 사람한테 갈 것으로 보입니다. 민희진 대표를 따라갈 수도 있고 하이브나 산하 그 레이블에 있을 수도 있고요. 결국 뉴진스가 이 사태를 관망하면서 우리가 아티스트로서 더 성장하는 데 누구의 손을 잡아야 되는가 고민에 빠지는 시점입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 마치 드라마를 보는 것처럼 20분이 지나갔습니다. 귀에 쏙쏙 들어온 말씀 잘 들었습니다. 손정혜 변호사였습니다. 감사합니다.
▶ 손정혜 : 감사합니다.

- [전종철의 전격시사] 손정혜 변호사 - “하이브-민희진 사태 격화…법적 쟁점은?”
-
- 입력 2024-05-01 09:56:07
▶ 손정혜 : 안녕하세요. 손정혜입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 이번 사건을 들여다보면 상당히 복잡합니다. 청취자분들 이해를 돕기 위해서 사건이 어떻게 진행됐는지 좀 간단히 정리를 해 주세요.
▶ 손정혜 : 일단 하이브라는 회사가 있고요. 하이브가 전액 출자해서 만든 회사가 어도어라는 회사입니다. 이 어도어의 대표가 이제 민희진 대표가 되겠고 현재 이 민희진 대표와 대주주, 지배주주인 하이브 간에 이제 갈등과 의사 충돌이 있다 이렇게 보시면 될 것 같고요. 그 과정에서 하이브는 이제 민희진 대표 이하 이사진에 대한 경영진에 대한 불신임을 지금 표하면서 지배주주, 대주주로서 이 민희진 대표를 대표이사직에서 해임하는 절차를 진행하고 있는 사건입니다. 그 과정에서 뭐 카피 논란도 있었던 것이고 또는 이제 주식 계약을 통해서 풋옵션 금액을 올려달라는 과정에서 협상이 불발됐다는 이야기도 있고 또 민희진 대표 측에서 이렇게 지금 하이브가 오히려 우리를 업무방해를 한다는 주장도 있고 하이브는 또 민희진 대표가 경영권을 탈취하려는 목적으로 일련의 과정들을 실행했다 서로 이제 공격하고 있는 상황이라고 보시면 되겠습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 이번에 등장한 생소한 용어가 레이블입니다. 하이브의 레이블 가운데 하나가 어도어고 민희진 대표는 어도어의 대표입니다. 일종의 자회사 같은 개념인데 엔터테인먼트 업계 특성상 레이블이라는 용어를 특별히 사용하는 건지 아니면 법적으로 자회사와 조금 다른 게 있는 건지 궁금합니다. 어떻습니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 레이블은 법률 용어는 전혀 아니고요. 일단 이 엔터테인먼트 측에서 예전에는 한 회사가 굉장히 다양한 아티스트를 한 회사가 모두 다 소속하고 있었잖아요. 그런데 그러다 보니까 독과점이라든가 경영 리스크가 분산되지 않는 문제가 있으니 예를 들면 하이브 같은 경우도 BTS는 다른 회사에서 소속하고 있고 뉴진스도 다른 법인을 세워서 이제 독립적으로 운영을 하기 위한 시도인데 레이블이라는 단어는 라벨이라고 생각하시면 편할 것 같습니다, 라벨링 할 때 라벨.
▷ 전종철 : Lable 그거예요?
▶ 손정혜 : 표, 소속의 표시 출처, 표지.
▷ 전종철 : Rable인가 혼자서 생각하고 있었어요.
▶ 손정혜 : 이 아티스트의 소속사를 이야기하는 거죠. 큰 모회사는 하이브이고 그 밑에 있는 작은 작은 자회사들이 모여서 이 큰 아티스트의 어떤 기업군을 형성하는 것인데 그래서 이 레이블이라는 건 그 아티스트들의 소속과 분류, 소속사를 이야기한다고 생각하시면 좀 쉽습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 경영상의 효율성 그다음에 리스크 분산 말씀해 주셨고요. 민희진 대표는 하이브의 다른 레이블, 빌리프랩에서 데뷔한 아이돌 아일릿이 뉴진스를 카피했다 이에 대해서 항의하자 하이브가 자신을 쫓아내려 하고 있다고 이제 주장하고 있습니다. 그런데 그동안 표절이라고 하면 우리가 보통 뭐 음악, 노래 베낀 게 전통적인 표절인데 이번에 어도어는 아일릿이 뉴진스의 헤어, 메이크업, 의상, 안무, 행사 출연 등 연예 활동 모든 영역에서 카피했다 이렇게 주장하고 있습니다. 이 같은 부분도 지적 재산권에 해당이 되나요?
▶ 손정혜 : 일반적으로는 이런 메이크업이나 의상 이런 소위 말하는 콘셉트라는 것은 사실 한정적인 영역이기 때문에 이런 아이디어 자체를 지적재산권으로 보장해 줄 수 없습니다. 이걸 지적재산권으로 보장해 주면 무슨 문제가 있냐면 예를 들면 우리가 예전에 핑클을 따라 했던 일반인들 많잖아요, 의상도 무대도 옷도. 그걸 따라 못하는 거죠, 저작권 위반이 되기 때문에. 단순한 어떤 메이크업이라든가 안무 같은 경우는 실제로는 저작권으로 보호하기는 어려운 아이디어 수준이나 콘셉트에 해당할 여지가 있고 다만 이제 부정경쟁방지법 이런 데 보면 너무 알려져서 그 자체가 재산적 가치가 되는 경우가 있거든요. 이런 콘셉트나 이런 내용들을 총합했을 때 그 사람의 퍼블리시티권을 침해할 정도, 그 정도의 복제본이 발생을 했다고 한다면 법률적인 이슈가 이야기될 수 있는데 많이 아시다시피 걸그룹이든 아티스트들이 비슷한 콘셉트를 유지하면서 조금 변형해가면서 성장해 왔거든요, 걸그룹의 역사가. 그래서 현재의 주장만으로는 지적재산권이라든가 부정경쟁방지법이라든가 이것을 위반했다고 보기는 조금 부족합니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그렇군요. 그러면 큰 틀에서 보면 뉴진스도 아일릿도 하이브 소속 아티스트라고 이제 볼 수 있는데요. 그러면 일종의 표절 논란이 발생했을 때 그 대상이 완전히 소속사가 다른 경우와 좀 다르지 않을까. 이번처럼 소속사가 같거나 관계 있는 경우는 법적으로 좀 차이가 있나요?
▶ 손정혜 : 사실은 법률적으로는 각각의 개별적인 독립된 회사니까 조금 다른, 대주주가 같다고 해서 일치된 의견이 나오지 않을 수 있는데 그럼에도 불구하고 주식회사는 주주가, 그러니까 주식을 소유함으로 인해서 소유 관계가 발생하잖아요. 하이브도 내 회사고 지금 말씀하신 어도어도 내 회사고 아일릿이 소유한 것도 대부분 지배주주는 같다고 한다면 경제적 이해관계가 동일하죠. 그래서 사실 이런 경우에는 표절 문제가 크게 발생하지 않는데 이번에 어도어와 하이브 간에 갈등이 이제 생기면서 사실은 이 문제보다는 다른 원인 때문에 더 갈등이 악화될 수 있을 것 같은데요.
▷ 전종철 : 돈 문제 아니냐, 예컨대.
▶ 손정혜 : 아티스트들이 워낙에 이제 관심을 많이 받는 주체다 보니 이런 아티스트 표절 논란까지 제기된 것으로 보이는데 일각에서는 지난해 12월에 민 대표와 하이브 간의 주주 간 계약서에 대한 재협상이 요구되면서 갈등이 시작했다고 분석을 하거든요. 왜냐하면 여기 보면 하이브가 민 대표에게 한 20%의 주식을 주면서 그 당시 시세로 35억 정도.
▷ 전종철 : 지금 한 18% 갖고 있는 것 같아요.
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 2%는 직원들한테 줬기 때문인데요. 그 18%에 대한 풋옵션. 그러니까 내가 어느 시점에 이것을 팔 때 그 당시 영업이익의 13배를 주겠다는 게 이 계약의 주요 요지인데 민 대표 측에서 30배를 올려달라 이렇게 주장을 했다는 보도가 나오고 있거든요. 현재 기준 영업이익만으로는 한 13배면 1천억 정도의 가치, 30배면 2,700억 가치로 평가가 된다고 하니까 이게 사실은 최소 수백억에서 천억 단위의 경제적인 이해관계에 대한 불일치 싸움이다 이렇게 보셔야 됩니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그러니까 어떻게 보면 결국 돈 문제인데 나머지 것들은 그 돈 문제를 포장하기 위한 어떤 구실일 수도 있겠네요. 제가 단정적으로 말씀드리는 건 아닙니다.
▶ 손정혜 : 돈이 큰 문제일 수 있고 또 아티스트를 어떻게 이제 운영하고 어떻게 이제 활동할지는 세부적으로 경영진의 의사가 다를 수는 있는 거죠.
▷ 전종철 : 뭐 그것도 중요하기는 하지만. 하이브는 민희진 대표가 경영권을 탈취하려고 했다면서 배임으로 고발했습니다. 그런데 하이브는 어도어 지분 지금 80%를 갖고 있어요. 그렇다면 하이브 측은 민 대표가 경영권을 어떻게 탈취하려 했다고 하는 건가요?
▶ 손정혜 : 그러니까 결국은 이제 하이브에 대한 주식 가치를 조금 떨어뜨리거나 여러 가지 방법으로 인해서 하이브가 이 지분을 매각하도록 유도한다는 취지인데 결국 경영권을 확보하려면 지분을 가져와야 되잖아요, 사든지 어떠한 방식이든지. 구체적인 내용까지 나오고 있지 않지만 어찌 됐든 하이브로부터 좀 독립된 경영권을 가지고자 어도어의 지분을 좀 늘리려는 시도는 있었던 것 같습니다. 의사의 어떤 표현이라고 해야 될까요? 그런데 어떤 회사를 운영하면서 내가 한 18% 주주인데 좀 더 지분을 늘리고자 한다, 우호적인 지분을 만들고자 한다는 건 통상 있을 수 있는 일이기 때문에 그게 불법은 아닙니다. 다만 이렇게 지분을 매수하려는 계획에서 불법적인 수단을 동원한다. 예를 들면 시세 조작을 통해서 시세를 떨어뜨려서 사온다거나 이런 것들은 불법이겠죠. 일단 하이브는 경영권을 탈취하려고 했고 그거는 영업 비밀을 유출한다든가 계약서 이야기가 나오고 있거든요. 그리고 부적절한 어떤 컨설팅을 받고 있다 이런 것들이 불법이다라고 주장하고 있는 상황입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 이 부분은 어떠세요? 경영권 탈출 시도가 좀 있다 하더라도 이 경우에 배임 미수도 아니고 계획 단계일 뿐이다. 그래서 법적으로 책임 물을 수 없다 이런 얘기도 나오거든요.
▶ 손정혜 : 지금 지배적인 의견으로는 업무상 배임죄라는 것은 결국은 대표이사로서 어도어에는 손해를 끼치고 나한테는 이익을 끼칠 수 있는 어떻게 보면 배신적 행위가 구체적으로 특정이 돼서 구체적으로 실행을 했어야 되는데.
▷ 전종철 : 실행, 그렇죠?
▶ 손정혜 : 실행에 나아가지도 않았을 뿐만 아니라 지금 문제된 내용이 어떤 대외비에, 그러니까 외부에 공개돼서는 안 되는 계약서를 가지고 투자를 유치하려고 했다는 거거든요. 그런데 이 투자를 유치한다는 거는 어도어한테는 손해가 아니죠, 투자를 받는 거니까. 그러니까 결국은 배임의 구성 요건이라고 하는 손해를 발생하려는 구체적인 계획과 실행이 현재로서는 확인되지 않아서 지금 업무상 배임으로 고발을 했다고 하더라도 처벌 여부는 매우 불확실하다라고 볼 수 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 하이브가 어도어 측의 경영진 교체를 위한 이사회 열어달라고 요청했는데 민 대표 이를 거부했습니다. 그러자 하이브는 임시 주주총회 열겠다면서 법원에 개최 허가 신청했습니다. 보통 임시 주주총회 열 때 법원 개최 허가를 보통 득하나요?
▶ 손정혜 : 원래 주총은 이사회의 권한이기 때문에 이사회의 의장인 민 대표가 열어야 되는데 민 대표가 안 열어주는 경우가 있을 수 있으니 그러면 상법에서는 3% 이상의 주주가 우리는 이런이런 안건으로 주총을 하겠습니다. 법원 허가해 주십시오라고 하면 법원이 결정으로 열어줄 수 있는 절차가 있거든요. 이건 소수 주주를 보호하기 위한 제도입니다. 그래서 특별한 사유 없으면 허가 결정이 나오고 임시주총까지 나아갈 가능성 매우 높고요. 다만 현재 어도어 측에서도 우리가 5월 말쯤에 열겠다 이렇게 의사표시를 하고 있어서 주총이 열릴 건데요. 주총의 안건은 명확하게 대표이사 이사들의 해임 안건이 올라올 겁니다. 그래서 사실 여기서 지분 경쟁을 해야 되는데 이미 80%를 하이브가 갖고 있기 때문에 어떤 의결권 행사에 하이브를 막을 수 있는 수단은 현재로서는 별로 없다.
▷ 전종철 : 그래요? 막을 수 없어서 임시 주주총회 통해서 대표직에서 이제 민 대표가 해임이 되면 어떤 그 차후에 대표직을 되찾을 방법은 있습니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 예를 들면 법률적으로 이 주총 결의가 무효다, 취소다라고 하면서 다툴 수 있는 수단은 있지만 실질적으로 주식회사의 주인은 주주라고 말씀드렸잖아요. 무려 80%, 3분의 2 이상을 가지고 있는 대주주가 우리는 해임하겠다고 하면 법률상 크게 불복할 수는 없을 겁니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그렇군요. 그동안 연예계 분쟁 하면 주로 소속사하고 아티스트 사이의 전속 계약이라든지 이런 문제였던 것 같아요, 대부분은. 그런데 최근에 경영권 분쟁이 자주 이제 눈에 띄고 이렇듯이요. 지난해에는 또 SM엔터테인먼트도 경영권 분쟁 겪지 않았습니까? 최근에 기획사 내부에서 이렇게 경영권 분쟁 잦아지게 된 이유 뭐라고 보세요?
▶ 손정혜 : 그만큼 우리 한국 시장의 엔터테인먼트, 연예기획사들의 경제적 가치가 매우 높아졌다는 거죠. 하나의 산업군이 되었을 뿐만 아니라 SM 경영권 분쟁에서 볼 수 있는 게 이수만 회장이 14.8%를 경영권 프리미엄을 얹어서 하이브에게 매각을 했는데 그 금액이 3,300억대입니다. 수천억대의 가치를 가지고 있기 때문에 싸움이 날 수밖에 없죠. 워낙 큰 가치가 있고.
▷ 전종철 : 먹을 게 커지니까 싸움도 생긴다?
▶ 손정혜 : 그렇습니다. 그리고 이 경영권을 확보하는 게.
▷ 전종철 : 집안하고 비슷하네요.
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 이익과 충돌될 수밖에 없으니까. 예를 들면 수십억이다 그러면 협의도 있고 하지만 수천억대는 이해관계자들이 너무 많겠죠. 그런 어떻게 보면 성장을 하는 성장통이라고도 보실 수 있겠습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 제 지인은 뭐 이런 얘기를 하더라고요. 집안에 재산이 30억 이하면 괜찮은데 30억 넘어갈 때 형제간에 분쟁이 생긴다 뭐 이런 얘기도 하던데 여하튼 파이가 커지니까 분쟁의 소지도 크다 그렇게 이제 이해가 됩니다. 지난해 SM엔터테인먼트 경영권 분쟁은 또 구체적으로 어떻게 진행됐고 또 어떻게 마무리가 됐습니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 아직까지 법률적으로는 종결되지 않은 사건들이 있습니다. 수사도 관련돼서 진행되고 있어서. 다만 카카오가 9% 매입하면서 이수만 회장의 경영권에 대한 도전이 있었고 이수만 회장은 이 경영권 프리미엄을 얹어서 또 하이브한테 매각을 했고. 그래서 어느 정도 지분 정리는 끝나 있는 상황이다. 경영권은 지금 어찌 됐든 대주주는 하이브한테 넘어간 상황이다라고 일단락됐다고 하지만 주식의 분포라는 게 대주주가 14.8%, 그러니까 압도적인 지분을 갖고 있지 않거든요. 그래서 항상 어느 사회나 어느 조직이나 경영권 분쟁은 남아 있다 이렇게 보실 수 있겠죠.
▷ 전종철 : 그럼 또 조금 다른 질문을 드려볼게요. 이번 사태가 진행되는 과정에서 하이브 측이 민희진 대표 측의 컴퓨터를 조사해서 카카오톡 대화 내용과 자료 이거를 확보한 것으로 알려졌습니다. 경찰이 하거나 그런 게 아니에요. 지금 회사 측이 한 겁니다. 그런데 하이브가 대주주이긴 하지만 민희진 대표가 소속 직원 개념은 아닌 것 같고 설사 소속 직원이라고 해도 회사가 컴퓨터에 저장된 자료를 조사할 수 있나 이런 논란이 생길 수 있거든요. 이게 법적으로는 어떻게 됩니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 일단은 하이브 측에서는 감사의 권한으로 이렇게 이제 사실관계를 했다고 주장할 여지는 있겠지만 일반적으로 카톡이라는 건 내밀한 개인 정보이기 때문에 이것을 권한 없이 열어본다든가 이것을 공개하는 것은 정보통신망법이나 개인정보법 위반이 될 여지가 있거든요.
▷ 전종철 : 그게 아마 수사기관도 그냥 막 뒤지는 게 아니라 어떤 영장이 필요하잖아요.
▶ 손정혜 : 영장이 있어야 되죠. 그래서 민희진 대표가 적극적으로 동의해서 제출한 자료가 아니면 이 자체의 자료 확보 과정에 불법성은 문제될 여지는 있고요. 다만 민 대표가 이것까지는 이제 문제를 삼거나 그러지는 않는 것 같습니다. 본인이 또 스스로 기자회견에서 본인도 이제 카톡 내용을 공개한 적도 있고.
▷ 전종철 : 그 내용에 대해서 부정을 한 건 아니고. 그렇죠?
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 그래서 이런 이슈는 이렇게 작게 작게 어떤 소송에 들어가면 문제가 될 여지는 있지만 큰 틀을 좌지우지할 수 있는 내용은 아니기 때문에 향후 이 부분도 공방이 되는지 지켜봐야 될 것 같습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그건 약간 부가적인 지엽적인 문제네요, 현재로서는.
▶ 손정혜 : 지엽적이죠.
▷ 전종철 : 나중에 모든 전면전으로 가면 이게 이것도 또 언급이 포함돼서 될 수는 있는 그 정도라고 이해하면 되겠네요. 또 이제 확보한 자료 가운데 일부가 공개됐습니다. 자료 확보하는 것과 확보된 자료 공개하는 건 또 법적으로 다를 수 있을 것 같아요. 이 부분은 어떻게 봐야 됩니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 그러니까 자료를 공개함으로 인해서 이 자료의 공개의 내용이 그 사람의 어떤 명예훼손이나 이런 것들을 심각하게 침해하는 경우가 있을 수 있거든요. 언론을 통해서 공개를 하는 거니까요. 그런 점에 있어서는 예를 들면 명예훼손이나 이런 걸로 이제 처벌받을 가능성이 있는데 항상 이제 공공의 이익을 목적으로 했다, 방어권 차원이었다라고 한다면 또 처벌까지 가지 않는 경우도 상당 부분 있습니다. 지금 양쪽에서 여론전을 펼치면서 유리한 자료를 발췌해서 제출하잖아요. 사실은 발췌된 자료 중에 상대방에 대해서 악의적으로 비방하는 내용이 있거나 욕설이 있으면 법률적으로는 처벌 소지도 있고 위법하다고 평가될 소지가 있는데 항상 여론전을 개개별로 또 고소고발해서 처벌하는 경우는 없고 결국은 큰 분위기 전환을 시도하려는 의사이기 때문에 큰 쟁점이 해소되면 이 부분들은 또 묻히는 경우도 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그렇죠, 아주 줄기는 아니니까 이게. 민희진 대표 기자회견도 주목을 받았습니다. 민 대표의 격정 토로에 진정성이 느껴졌다, 공감된다 이런 인터넷상의 평가도 있었고요. 반면에 기자회견에서 비속어나 너무 거친 표현은 적절치 않았다는 지적도 있습니다. 솔직히 같은 여성으로서 좀 통쾌함 같은 거 느끼셨어요, 안 느끼셨어요?
▶ 손정혜 : 좀 생소하고 신선한 기자회견이었지만 좀 저는 변호사니까.
▷ 전종철 : 부담됐어요?
▶ 손정혜 : 이게 본인한테 법률적으로 이익이나 그런...
▷ 전종철 : 그것부터 먼저 보여요?
▶ 손정혜 : 생각이 들었는데 그래도 여론을 바꾸는 데는 굉장히 주요했다고 보입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 이게 약간 어필을 한 것 같아요.
▶ 손정혜 : 특히 젊은 층에서 이렇게 할 말 다 하고 준비하지 않고 기자회견에서 쌍욕, 비속어 막 나오는 기자회견 처음 본 거거든요.
▷ 전종철 : 그런데 그렇게까지 얘기하는데 저게 거짓말일까, 과연. 그렇죠?
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 그 억울함이 좀 전달됐다 이런 의견도 좀 많은 것 같고 할 말 다 하는 사람이다라는 평가도 있는 반면에 옆에 양쪽에 변호사님이 얼굴을 못 뜨는 장면이 있거든요.
▷ 전종철 : 아이고, 아이고 하고 막.
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 이거는 법률적으로 불리할 수 있는 소지도 있는데 그렇게 했다라는 부분에서는 이 기자회견을 둘러싼 의견도 굉장히 좀 갈리고 있는 것 같습니다. 재미있는 광경이기는 합니다.
▷ 전종철 : 변호사시니까 민 대표가 공개적으로 이제 말하다 보니까 특정인들을 계속 저격했단 말이에요, 공개된 장소에서. 물론 기자회견에서 지금 누구를 저격할 수밖에 없는 구조이긴 하지만 그게 법적으로 어떤 문제가 됩니까?
▶ 손정혜 : 원래는 모욕과 명예훼손을 검토해 볼 수 있어요. 막 쌍욕도 나오고 했으니까요. 근데 문제는 제가 이제 손정혜니까 손정혜라고 하면서 탁탁탁탁 욕설을 쓴 게 아니라 그냥 욕설만 나왔거든요. 이게 혼잣말의 욕설인지 누구를 향해서 이런 욕설을 했는지에 대한 특정성이 좀 부족하더라고요. 예를 들면 하이브 누구가 OOOOO 이렇게 욕을 한 것이 아니어서요. 그래서 실질적으로는.
▷ 전종철 : 법적으로 문제가 좀 덜 될 수 있어요?
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 특정이 되어야 되죠. 누구를 모욕했는지가 좀 불명확해서 일단은 성립 여지는 있지만 현재로서는 특정성이 좀 부족해 보이고 혼자서 한탄해서 혼자서 이제 화가 나서 하는 비속어도 일부 있더라고요. 그 정도만으로는 처벌까지 가지 않을 것 같고 하이브 측에서도 이것 자체를 이제 고소고발하려고는 하지 않을 것이고 다만 대표이사 해임하거나 여러 가지 민사 소송 과정에서 이런 부적절한 태도가 있었다라고 어필할 걸로 보입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 전반적인 상황을 보면 하이브와 민희진 대표는 이제 결별 수순은 밟고 있는 것 같고요. 그런데 이 경우에 하이브와 어도어의 결별보다는 민희진 대표가 대표직에서 해임될 가능성이 크다 이런 얘기가 나오고 있거든요. 실제로 그런 약간 수순으로 가고 있다고 보세요?
▶ 손정혜 : 네, 대표이사 해임 안건을 통과시킬 만한 80%의 지분을 확보하고 있는 하이브는 민희진 대표를 해임하려는 생각이 굉장히 확고해졌을 가능성이 있고요. 그 이후에 이제 절차는 민희진 대표가 가지고 있는 주식을 어떻게 평가해서 권리를 행사할 것이냐. 민사 소송이 진행되겠죠. 주식에 대한 가치나 손해배상 청구에 대한 양방 공방이 이루어질 것이고 대표직을 해임하는 이 결의도 위법하다라고 민희진 대표는 다툴 수 있습니다. 그래서 소송이 장기화될 가능성이 있습니다. 최소 6개월, 1년 이상 법률적인 다툼은 계속 진행될 여지가 있고요. 다만 여론이 안 좋아지거나 아티스트들한테 해가 된다고 한다면 법정에서 정리가 되는 게 아니라 쌍방 합의에 이를 가능성은 여전히 있죠. 팬들은 합의했으면 좋겠다 이런 생각을 갖고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 팬들의 가장 큰 관심은 마지막 질문입니다. 이거 만약에 해임되면 뉴진스 어떻게 되는 거지? 이게 걱정일 것 같아요.
▶ 손정혜 : 민희진 대표라는 한 사람이 없다고 하더라도 뉴진스가 활동을 못하지는 않기 때문에 지금 이 사태에도 불구하고 뉴진스의 공개 행보는 굉장히 긍정적인 평가를 받고 있거든요. 다만 이 사태가 악화돼서 서로 더 공방전이 이루어진다고 한다면 아티스트의 명예나 이미지가 안 좋아지겠죠. 거기까지 가면 안 된다라는 측면이고요. 뉴진스도 이제 계약 기간이 있습니다, 어도어하고 언제까지 계약. 그 이후에 이제 뉴진스는 어디로 갈 것인가의 문제죠. 아직 시간적인 부분이 있는데 더 신뢰하는 사람한테 갈 것으로 보입니다. 민희진 대표를 따라갈 수도 있고 하이브나 산하 그 레이블에 있을 수도 있고요. 결국 뉴진스가 이 사태를 관망하면서 우리가 아티스트로서 더 성장하는 데 누구의 손을 잡아야 되는가 고민에 빠지는 시점입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 마치 드라마를 보는 것처럼 20분이 지나갔습니다. 귀에 쏙쏙 들어온 말씀 잘 들었습니다. 손정혜 변호사였습니다. 감사합니다.

Article: [930 날씨] 전국 가끔 구름…내일부터 기온 오름세
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
현재 비는 대부분 그친 상태입니다.
토요일까지는 대체로 맑겠지만, 어린이날인 일요일 오후부터 전국에 비가 내리기 시작해 대체 공휴일인 다음 주 월요일에도 비가 이어지겠습니다.
내일부터는 기온이 다시 오름세를 보이겠습니다.
내일은 서울의 낮 기온이 초여름의 기준인 25도까지 오르겠고, 모레 금요일에는 28도, 토요일에는 29도 등 30도 가까이 올라가 덥겠습니다.
다만 내일과 모레는 내륙 지역의 아침 기온이 10도 아래로 떨어지면서 쌀쌀해 기온의 일교차가 15도에서 20도 이상 매우 크게 벌어지겠습니다.
오늘은 전국에 가끔 구름이 끼겠고, 오전부터 밤 사이에는 대기가 불안정해져 전라도를 중심으로 5에서 10밀리미터 안팎의 소나기가 오는 곳도 있겠습니다.
전남 해안과 경남 해안에는 바람이 강하게 불겠습니다.
낮 기온은 서울이 24도, 춘천과 원주, 청주 23, 전주와 광주, 대구 20도로 중부지방은 어제보다 조금 높겠고, 남부지방은 어제보다 1도에서 5도 정도 낮겠습니다.
바다의 물결은 제주 남쪽 먼바다에서 최고 4미터로 높게 일겠습니다.
경상도 해안과 제주도 해안에는 높은 너울이 밀려오는 곳이 있겠습니다.
날씨 전해드렸습니다.

Article: “공영도매시장 경쟁 촉진, 온라인 도매시장 키워 유통비용 10% 줄일 것”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
농림축산식품부와 해양수산부는 공영 도매시장의 경쟁을 촉진하고 온라인 도매시장을 키우는 내용의 농수산물 유통구조 개선방안을 오늘(1일) 발표했습니다.
우선 공영도매시장에서 경매를 맡는 도매법인의 경쟁을 촉진해 도매시장 공공성과 효율성을 높이기로 했습니다.
기존 도매법인에 대해서는 5∼10년의 지정 기간이 만료되면 성과를 평가해 재지정 여부를 결정하고, 신규 법인은 공모제로 선정하기로 했습니다.
특히 성과가 부진한 법인의 경우 지정 기간 중에도 반드시 지정을 취소하도록 ‘농수산물 유통 및 가격안정에 관한 법률’을 개정하겠다고 밝혔습니다.
정부는 또 시장 규모에 맞는 법인 수 기준을 마련해 지방자치단체의 신규법인 지정을 의무화하고 도매법인이 받고 있는 4~7%의 위탁수수료가 적정한지에 대해서도 연구용역을 실시하겠다고 설명했습니다.
가락시장 법인이 조성 중인 10억 원 규모의 공익기금을 늘려 출하자 지원, 수급 안정 등에 쓰도록 할 예정입니다.
도매법인과 중도매인을 거쳐야 하는 유통 구조를 바꾸기 위해 온라인 도매시장의 규모를 키우는 안도 추진됩니다.
정부는 온라인 도매시장 거래 규모를 오는 2027년까지 가락시장 수준인 5조 원 규모로 키우겠다고 밝혔습니다.
올해 하반기에는 수산물 판매를 시작하는 등 2027년까지 거래 품목을 190여 개로 늘려 가락시장 수준으로 확대하기로 했습니다.
판매자 가입 기준도 연간 거래 규모 50억 원에서 20억 원으로 낮추기로 했습니다.
중소형 마트와 전통시장도 거래 물량을 규모화할 수 있게 농협과 상인연합회를 통한 공동구매 시스템을 구축하도록 했고 통합물류 기능도 확충합니다.
또 2026년까지 농산물 산지 유통의 거점이 되는 스마트 농산물 산지유통센터 100곳을 구축하고 유통센터의 청과물 취급 비중을 생산량의 30%에서 50%까지 확대할 계획입니다.
사과와 배 취급률은 2022년 21%에서 2030년 50%로 늘릴 수 있도록 기체 제어 시설을 갖춘 저온저장고를 확충하고, 배추와 무는 농협이 연중 농작업 대행반을 운영해 농산물 산지유통센터의 취급 물량을 2022년 13%에서 2030년 20%로 확대할 계획입니다.
정부는 소비자단체, 대형 유통업체와 함께 농산물을 소포장하지 않고 유통하는 이른바 벌크 유통 환경도 조성할 방침입니다.
농식품부는 농산물을 소포장할 때 발생하는 추가 유통 비용과 소비자 불편을 고려해, 농협 하나로마트에 사과 등 주요 품목의 벌크 유통을 시범 도입하겠다고 밝혔습니다.
정부는 또 유통 단계별 사재기나 가격 담합 등 불공정 거래 행위를 지속 점검하기로 했습니다.
산지에서 소비지까지 주요 유통업체 대상으로 보유 물량 사전신고제를 도입해 상시 점검 체계를 구축하고 필요하면 신속하게 단속할 수 있게 농산물 매점매석 고시 제정도 검토하기로 했습니다.
수산물은 부산공동어시장 등 거점 위판장 100곳을 현대화해 전국 214개 산지위판장 통합을 유도합니다. 김, 천일염 등 주요 품목은 수협 등 생산자단체를 통해 계약재배해 안정적인 수급 관리체계를 구축합니다.
수산물을 안정적으로 공급하기 위해 소비지분산물류센터 확장을 검토하고, 생선 상자를 나무에서 플라스틱으로 교체해 규격화하기로 했습니다.
정부는 최근 고물가 원인의 하나로 지목된 복잡한 유통 과정과 과도한 마진 등의 문제점을 개선하기 위해 기획재정부, 해양수산부 등 관련 부처와 함께 방안을 마련했으며, 이를 통해 현재 가격의 49.7% 수준인 유통비용을 10% 이상 줄일 수 있을 것으로 기대한다고 밝혔습니다.

Article: 정부, 게임산업 육성 계획 내놔…“30조원 산업으로 성장 키운다”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
문화체육관광부는 오늘(1일) 이런 계획을 담은 ‘2024-2028 게임산업 진흥 종합계획’을 내놓으며 “2028년까지 게임 매출 30조 원, 게임 수출액 120억 달러, 게임 종사자 9만 5천 명 규모로 산업을 육성하겠다”고 발표했습니다.
먼저 콘솔 게임에 대한 투자를 늘리기로 했습니다. 콘솔 게임은 세계 시장에서 모바일 다음으로 가장 큰 점유율을 가진 게임 영역입니다.
정부는 “한국산 콘솔 게임의 세계 시장 점유율은 1.5%에 불과했지만, 최근 ‘피의 거짓’, ‘데이브 더 다이버’ 등 세계적으로 주목받는 콘솔게임이 배출되고 있다”며 성장 잠재력이 큰 영역으로 평가했습니다.
이에 따라 한국 게임의 콘솔 분야 진출 확대를 위해 마이크로소프트와 소니, 닌텐도 등 주요 콘솔 플랫폼 기업과 협력해 국내 유망 게임을 발굴하고, 콘솔 플랫폼에 맞는 게임을 제작하는 업체엔 플랫폼 입점·홍보까지 연계해 지원한다는 계획입니다.
인디 게임도 집중적으로 육성합니다. 인디 게임 개발사와 선도 기업을 연계하는 ‘상생 협력형 창업지원’ 사업을 도입하고, 국내 대학과 연계를 통해 학생들의 우수 프로젝트가 실제 게임으로 제작될 수 있도록 지원하기로 했습니다.
제도적인 환경 개선을 위해 규제 장벽도 낮춥니다. 본인인증 수단이 없는 청소년이라도 법정 대리인의 동의를 받으면 전체이용가 게임을 이용할 수 있도록 바꾸고, 이용자가 게임 시간을 스스로 정해 소위 ‘선택적 셧다운제’로 불리는 게임시간선택제는 자율규제로 전환해 게임사가 자체적으로 운영할 수 있도록 개선할 예정입니다.
아울러 성인물을 서비스하지 않는 오락실과 PC방을 청소년 고용 금지 업소에서 제외하는 방안도 마련했습니다.
전병극 문체부 1차관은 “우리 게임산업이 잘하고 있는 분야를 넘어 콘솔게임 등 새로운 분야에 적극적으로 도전해 게임의 모든 분야에서 세계의 인정을 받길 바란다”며 “문체부도 구체적 방안을 실천하는 데 적극 노력하겠다”고 밝혔습니다.

Article: 트럼프 “부자 한국 왜 방어?”…주한미군 철수 시사하며 방위비 압박
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
오는 11월 미국 대선의 유력 후보인 트럼프 전 대통령이 미국 언론과의 인터뷰에서 주한미군 철수 가능성을 시사하는 발언을 했습니다.
과거 재임 시절과 같이 방위비 분담금의 대폭 인상을 요구하기 위한 거란 분석도 나옵니다.
워싱턴 이정민 특파원입니다.
[리포트]
공화당 대선 후보인 트럼프 전 대통령이 미국 시사주간지 타임과의 인터뷰에서 주한미군에 대한 견해를 밝혔습니다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 주한미군을 두고 "위험한 곳에 4만 명의 미군이 있다", "말도 안 된다. 왜 우리가 다른 누군가를 방어해야 하냐"고 말했습니다.
그러면서 한국을 두고 "매우 부유한 나라"라고 덧붙였습니다.
타임지는 트럼프 전 대통령의 이 발언에 대해 한국이 주한미군을 더 많이 지원하지 않으면 미군이 철수할 가능성을 시사한 발언이라고 설명했습니다.
타임지는 또 주한미군 규모가 실제 2만 8천5백 명인데 4만 명이라고 트럼프 전 대통령이 잘못 언급했다고도 지적했습니다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 지난 2월, 북대서양조약기구, 나토에 방위비를 늘리지 않는다면 더 이상 보호하지 않겠다는 발언을 해 파장을 일으킨 바 있습니다.
[도널드 트럼프/미국 전 대통령/공화당 대선 경선 후보/지난 2월 : "나는 (나토를) 보호하지 않을 겁니다. 사실 러시아에게 하고 싶은 대로 하라고 독려할 거예요. (나토는) 돈을 지불해야죠."]
한국에 대해서도 주한미군 철수 가능성을 언급하며 큰 폭의 방위비 인상을 압박하는 걸로 풀이됩니다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 대통령 재임 당시 한국에 방위비 분담금으로 전년의 6배에 가까운 50억 달러, 우리 돈 6조 원을 요구했고, 재임 기간 주한미군 철군도 꾸준히 주장했던 것으로 알려져 있습니다.
한미 양국은 지난달 말부터 2026년에 적용될 새 방위비분담 특별협정 체결을 위한 협상에 착수했습니다.
대선 전에 협상을 마무리하기 위해 앞당겨 협상을 개시했다는 해석이 나옵니다.
하지만 미국 정가는 한미 양국이 방위비 협상을 마치더라도 트럼프 전 대통령이 재선된다면 재협상을 요구할 가능성을 배제할 수 없다고 전망하고 있습니다.

오는 11월 미국 대선의 유력 후보인 트럼프 전 대통령이 미국 언론과의 인터뷰에서 주한미군 철수 가능성을 시사하는 발언을 했습니다.
과거 재임 시절과 같이 방위비 분담금의 대폭 인상을 요구하기 위한 거란 분석도 나옵니다.

청주지법 형사5단독 정우혁 부장판사는 업무상횡령 혐의로 기소된 64살 유 모 씨에게 징역 6개월을 선고했습니다.
유 씨는 2017년 2월부터 2020년 8월까지 충북 청주의 한 빌라 자치회장으로 일하면서 관리비·수선비용 명목으로 입주자대표회의 계좌에 보관하고 있던 공금 2,060여만 원을 개인 빚을 갚는 데 쓰는 등 횡령한 혐의로 재판을 받았습니다.
정 부장판사는 "별다른 죄의식 없이 자치회장이라는 지위를 적극적으로 이용해 주민들의 공동이익을 위해 써야 할 자금을 임의로 소비해 비난 가능성이 크고, 피해가 제대로 회복되지 않았다"고 양형 이유를 밝혔습니다.

Article: 시흥 고가차로 공사 현장서 상판 붕괴…부산 아파트 화재로 1명 숨져
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
어제 오후, 경기 시흥시의 한 고가차로 공사 현장에서 구조물이 붕괴돼 7명이 다쳤습니다.
또, 어젯밤 부산의 한 아파트에서 불이 나 남성 한 명이 숨진 채 발견됐습니다.
밤 사이 사건·사고 소식, 이규명 기자의 보도입니다.
[리포트]
곳곳에 나뒹구는 시멘트와 철근 더미.
부서진 대형 구조물 일부는 크레인에 위태롭게 매달려 있습니다.
어제 오후 4시 반쯤 경기 시흥시 월곶가교 공사 현장에서 54m 길이의 대형 구조물이 추락했습니다.
크레인이 교량 기둥 사이를 잇는 상판 부분을 옮기던 중 구조물이 추락한 것으로 추정되고 있습니다.
[윤창희/시흥소방서 현장지휘단장 : "교각 구조물 연결로 이탈로 인한 구조물 연쇄 붕괴로 추정됩니다."]
이 사고로 50대 작업자 한 명이 교량에서 추락해 머리를 크게 다치는 등 7명이 다쳤습니다.
사고 수습이 길어지면서 시흥시 서해안로 방산교차로에서 월곶교차로 구간, 월곶 방향 도로가 여전히 통제 중입니다.
시흥시는 시민들에게 재난문자를 보내 해당 구간을 우회해달라고 요청했습니다.
새카맣게 타버린 아파트 내부.
어젯밤 9시쯤 부산시 온천동의 한 아파트 9층에서 불이 나 30분 만에 꺼졌습니다.
불이 난 가구에서는 50대 남성이 숨진 채 발견됐고, 주민들이 대피하는 소동이 벌어졌습니다.
경찰과 소방당국은 정확한 화재 원인을 조사하고 있습니다.
어젯밤 11시 50분쯤엔 경기 김포시 구래동 일대 아파트와 오피스텔 9백 세대가 4분가량 정전돼 승강기 갇힘 신고 4건 등 20여 건의 정전 관련 신고가 잇따랐습니다.
한국전력공사는 정확한 원인을 파악하고 있습니다.

Article: ‘채상병 의혹’ 윗선 수사 속도…유재은 구속영장은 “아직”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
해병대 채 상병 사망 사건과 관련한 외압 의혹을 수사 중인 고위공직자범죄수사처가 유재은 국방부 법무관리관을 상대로 두 차례 걸쳐 고강도 조사를 벌였습니다.
공수처는 또 다른 핵심 피의자인 김계환 해병대 사령관과 박경훈 전 국방부 조사본부장 직무대리 등을 소환하는 등 이른바 '윗선' 수사에 속도를 낼 방침입니다.
김영훈 기자의 보도입니다.
[리포트]
첫 공수처 소환에서 14시간에 걸친 고강도 조사를 받은 유재은 국방부 법무관리관.
두 번째 소환 조사도 12시간 넘게 진행됐습니다.
[유재은/국방부 법무관리관/어제 : "(오늘 재조사 어떤 부분 중점적으로 이뤄졌나요?) 질문하시는 부분에 성실히 답변드렸습니다."]
유 관리관은 채 상병 사망 사건을 초기 조사한 박정훈 당시 해병대 수사단장에 대한 외압 의혹과 함께, 사건 기록 회수, 수정 과정에 모두 관여한 의혹을 받고 있습니다.
공수처 관계자는 유 관리관에 대한 구속영장 청구 여부를 묻는 기자들의 질문에 "현시점에서 검토하는 건 없다"고 밝혔습니다.
유 관리관에 대한 소환조사에 이어 공수처는 김계환 해병대 사령관, 박경훈 전 국방부 조사본부장 직무대리도 조만간 소환할 계획입니다.
김 사령관은 지난해 7월 31일 박 전 단장에게 'VIP가 격노하면서 장관과 통화한 후 이렇게 되었다'고 말했던 것으로 알려졌습니다.
박 전 직무대리는 지난해 8월 국방부 검찰단이 경찰로부터 찾아온 수사 기록을 재검토한 끝에 혐의자를 기존 8명에서 2명으로 줄인 최종 결과를 내놓은 책임자입니다.
공수처는 유 관리관이 진술한 내용 등을 토대로 이르면 이번 주 후반 이들을 피의자 신분으로 불러 관련 경위를 추궁할 방침입니다.

▶ 윤상현 : 그런데 이게 보통 선거는 바람과 구도의 싸움이라고 했는데 이번에는 정권 심판의 바람이 너무너무 셌습니다. 제 지역의 민주당 후보가 3, 4개월 전에 저하고 17% 차이가 났는데 선거 가까이 오면서 거의 박빙으로 왔거든요. 제 지역이 이러는데 다른 지역은 어떻겠나. 정말로 대참패다 이런 예감이 왔고요. 살아온 이유를 얘기하면 어떤 저의 진정성의 전달이 아닌가 이런 생각을 합니다. 왜냐하면 저는 좀 정치하는 목적이 남다른 목적을 가지고 있습니다. 제가 국제정치학 또 공부도 해보고 교수 생활을 해보고 현실 정치하면서 대한민국에 필요한 정치의 개념이 반드시 따로 있을 거다. 그 개념을 한번 내리고 싶거든요. 그래서 좀 색다른 정치 실험을 하는데 일단 기본적으로 사람 위에 사람 없고 사람 밑에 사람 없다. 사람은 거의 똑같다, 계급적 측면에서 말씀드리면. 그래서 전 계급적 인간이 되자 이런 신념을 가지고 있고 또 *** 반드시 있을 거다. 그건 바로 사람입니다. 사람이 가장 중요하다. 그래서 당보다는 사람, 이념보다는 사람 이게 가장 기본적인 인식이 돼 있고요. 또 정치라는 게 기본적으로 서비스다 이 생각을 가지고 이제 행동하다 보니까 어떤 그게 전달이 되지 않았나 이런 생각을 해봅니다.
▷ 전종철 : 사람 중심 정치, 서비스 정치 말씀해주셨고요.
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 맞습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 개인적으로는 기쁘시겠지만 당 상황이 좋지 않습니다. 그러다 보니 당에 쓴 소리 많이 하고 계십니다. 야권에 192석 갖다 바치고도 이렇게 한가하냐 꼬집기도 했고요. 국민의힘에서 이렇게 위기감, 절박함 부족한 이유 뭐라고 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 일단은 수도권에 비해서 너무 모르는 겁니다. 수도권 감수성이라고 할까요? 수도권에 대한 현실 인식이 너무 없고요. 이게 기본적으로 수도권이라는 게 공천받는다고 당선되는 게 아니라 오히려 떨어질 확률이 큰 수도권이거든요. 그런데 우리 당의 기본적인 분위기는 수도권을 겁냅니다. 예를 들어서 수도권에서 떨어지면 일단 영남으로 갑니다. 수도권은 포기하는 거예요. 그리고 완전히 아예 영남으로 가거든요. 아예 이런 인식이 많이 만연돼 있는 것 같아요. 그래서 기본적으로 이게 민주당하고 다른 게 뭐냐 하면 민주당 한번 보십시오. 민주당은 호남을 기반으로 하면서도 수도권으로 확장하지 않습니까? 수도권 당 지도부, 수도권 원내지도부가 들어가는데 대단히 전략적인. 우리는 전략적이지를 못해요. 영남 중심의 어떤 당의 한계를 탈피를 못하고 있다.
▷ 전종철 : 그런 것이 크다.
▶ 윤상현 : 이게 결국은 위원들의 우리들의 어떤 사고방식부터 바꿔야 되지 않나 이런 생각이 듭니다.
▷ 전종철 : 영수회담 평가해보겠습니다. 윤석열 대통령과 이재명 대표의 첫 영수회담 점수 매긴다면 몇 점 주시겠습니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 저는 그래도 이제 시작이 반이다라는 속담이 있으니까 한 50점은 될 수 있지 않나. 왜냐하면 이제 좀 첫술에 배부를 수는 없죠, 물론. 그러나 미흡한 점이 있지만 여야의 최고 지도자들이 2년 만에 만나서 대화하고 경청의 자리를 가졌다. 그래서 일단 대화의 물꼬, 소통의 물꼬를 텄다 이런 면에서 한 50점은 줘야 되지 않나 이런 생각을 합니다.
▷ 전종철 : 정치적 손익계산서 볼 때 그러면 윤 대통령과 이 대표도 좀 실익이 없지는 않았다고 보시는 거네요.
▶ 윤상현 : 이제 일단은 두 분이 중요한 게 여러 가지, 이재명 대표가 한 10가지 세부적 의제를 말씀하셔서 다 들어주지 않았습니다만 일단 의료 개혁의 필요성 또 의대 증원이 불가피하다라는 것에 대해서 두 분이 인식을 같이 했거든요. 연금 개혁도 의지를 같이 했고 또 앞으로 만나기로 했고요. 그래서 윤 대통령에 있어서는 이제 어느 정도 의료 개혁 등 현안에 대해서 야권 지도자, 최고 지도자의 지지를 이끌어냈고요. 제가 보기에 또 우리 이재명 대표도 어떤 대통령한테 하고 싶은 말씀을 전부 다 하고 또 일종의 이제 국정의 파트너로서 인정을 받은 거죠. 이런 게 좀 있지 않나 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 회담 후에 야당은 ‘대통령이 민생 회복과 국정 기조 전환 받아들이지 않았다, 회담을 했어도 변화가 없다, 상황 인식이 안이하다, 향후 국정이 우려된다.’ 이렇게 공식 입장을 내놨는데 반면에 이재명 대표는 ‘답답하고 아쉽다’면서도 ‘소통의 첫 장을 열었다는 데 의미를 두겠다.’ 이런 얘기를 했어요. 그래서 이제 첫 회동에서 소통 물꼬를 텄다면 다음에 이제 협치의 불씨를 살려야 할 텐데 그러면 다음 회동에서는 어떻게 하면 좋을까요?
▶ 윤상현 : 일단은 이제 다음 회동을 위해서는 좀 세부적인 준비가 있어야 될 것 같아요. 예를 들어서 어떤 내용적인 성숙, 예를 들어서 우리 대통령께서 민생을 위한 여야정 협의체를 제안하지 않았습니까? 여야정 협의체, 그러니까 과거에도 그런 선례가 많거든요. 그래서 여야정 협의체를 통해서 어떤 여야 간에 먼저 실무적인 논의를 하고 또 그다음에 회동을 하고 이렇게 하면 좋을 것 같아요, 저는.
▷ 전종철 : 이게 대통령이 제의를 하긴 했는데 이재명 대표는 약간 국회에서 또 할 영역이 있다 이러고 약간 아직은 좀 보고 있는 것 같아요.
▶ 윤상현 : 아직은 보고 있는데 예를 들어서 국회에서 보면 일단 민주당 단독으로 모든 일을 할 수 있는 상황 아닙니까. 괜히 여야정 협의체에 갔다가 어떤 부담을 같이 나눠 질까 봐, 또 그쪽 입장에서는 또 여당의 어떤 작전이나 시간 끌기에 당하지 않나 이런 의구심이 있을 수 있지 않습니까. 그런데 현재 여소야대 상황에서 협치라는 것은 선택이 아닌 필수입니다. 대통령이나 여당은 무조건 야당하고 소통, 협치할 수밖에 없습니다. 그래서 어떤 여당에 대한 믿음을 가지고 민생협의체를 한번 받아주셨으면 하는 그런 바람을 가지고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 이달에 아마도 오래지 않아서 윤 대통령 취임 2주년 기자회견 실시할 것으로 알려졌고요. 지금 기류 긍정적인 것 같기는 합니다만 만약 실제로 기자회견이 열린다면 어떤 메시지가 담겨야 한다고 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 그런데 대통령께서 그동안 국민적인 기대에 못 미친 부분이 많지 않습니까. 그런 부분에 대한 진정성 있는 성찰이 있어야 될 것 같고요. 그런 거에 대해서 대통령께서 앞으로 어떻게 하시겠다. 예를 들어서 또 이번 총선 참패의 의미라는 것을 이제 말씀 주시고 또 국민 눈높이에 맞는 소통의 방식이라든지 민심을 받드는 정부의 모습을 보여주겠다 이런 약속도 하시고 이런 식으로 가지 않을까 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 국민의힘은 이번 주에 황우여 비상대책위원회를 출범시킬 예정입니다. 황우여 비대위 카드 어떻게 평가하세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 그런데 저는 이제 황우여 비대위원장은 저는 계속해서 관리형 비대위가 아니라 혁신형 비대위가 들어와야 된다. 대참패를 겪어서 우리가 반성 또 사죄 그리고 혁신의 모습을 보여야 된다고 했는데 일단.
▷ 전종철 : 단순히 전당대회만 준비하는 게 아니다, 지금은.
▶ 윤상현 : 맞습니다. 그래서 이제 당 지도부가 관리형 비대위도 하고 또 비대위원장을 황우여 전 대표님을 모셨는데 이분 뭐 개인적으로 저하고 친하고.
▷ 전종철 : 아니, 인천 지역구도 같이 하셨잖아요.
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 옆쪽 구셨고요. 경륜 있고 합리적이고 또 온건한 분인데 관리형 비대위원장으로서는 좋은 분인 건 사실입니다, 관리형 비대위원장으로서는.
▷ 전종철 : 그런 면에서는 평가를 하시고요. 조금 아쉬운 점도 있다는 말씀하시는데 지금 비대위 인선 작업 아마 진행되고 있을 겁니다. 수도권 중도층 민심 제대로 반영하기 위해서 수도권 원외 조직위원장들 좀 들어가야 하는 거 아니냐 이런 얘기 있는데 동의하세요
▶ 윤상현 : 물론 그렇습니다. 예, 동의하는데 일단 우리 황우여 대표에 대해서 좀 부연 설명을 하면 관리형 비대위원장으로 오셨지만 저는 그분한테 좀 혁신형 비대위원장 역할도 같이 해달라. 그래서 통합형으로 해달라. 지금은 혁신과 반성과 자성의 시기고 또 총선백서도 만들고 또 어떤 전대 룰도 개정하고 이런 걸 해야 된다라고 꼭 주문해주고 싶고요. 일단은 이제 원외위원장들을 보면 정말로 훌륭한 분들이 많습니다. 그래서 이분들이 우리 당이 가진 문제점이나 또 앞으로 갈 방향이나 또 이제 쇄신, 혁신의 과제들을 잘 알고 있거든요. 당연히 이분들이 들어가셔야 됩니다.
▷ 전종철 : 당대표 선출을 위한 룰 바꿔야 된다고 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 당연히 바꿔야 됩니다.
▷ 전종철 : 민심 반영하는 걸로요?
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 당이라는 게 민심의 바다 위에 떠 있는 배거든요. 그래서 이번에는 민심의 회초리를 맞았기 때문에 민심에 순응하는 변화된 모습을 보여줘야 한다 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 시간이 지금 좀 남았습니다만 지금 생각하시기에 당대표 출마하십니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 아닙니다. 지금은 당대표 얘기할 때가 아니고요. 지금은 어떻든지 혁신의 타임입니다. 혁신의 타임입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그러니까 혁신과 반성의 모습을 국민들에게 보여줄 시기지 지금 내가 당대표 나온다. 지금 뭐 부인하는 것은 아니고 여하튼 그런 걸 생각할 시기가 지금 아니다 그런 뜻이죠?
▶ 윤상현 : 지금은 아닙니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그렇다면 차기 당대표는 혁신 얘기도 하셨지만 어떤 자격을 갖춘 분이 와야 됩니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 저는요. 우리 당의 현재 정신이 뭐냐. 시대 정신이 뭐냐면 혁신입니다, 혁신. 혁신과 쇄신. 혁신 당대표. 그러면 혁신의 이미지를 가지고 결국 보수의 가치를 재정립해야 합니다. 혁신 보수의 가치가 뭔지. 사실 보수가 너무나도 꼴통 보수같이 돼 있거든요. 그래서 혁신 보수의 가치를 정립하고요. 그리고 어떤 우리 당의 잘못된 체제, 병패들을 좀 개선하고요. 병패 보면 뭐 뺄셈 정치의 DNA, 이익집단화되는 DNA, 예를 들어서 군림하는 DNA 저는 한 세 가지로 정의를 합니다만 이런 것을 탈피하고 또 어떤 수도권 중도로서 외연 확장하는 그런 가능성 그런 비전을 제시하는 대표가 돼야 된다 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 중도 외연 확장. 아까 이제 뺄셈 정치를 극복하고 덧셈 정치 얘기는 그동안 많이 하셨었어요.
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 많이 해왔습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 혁신 보수의 가치 이건 좌표 설정을 확실히 다시 해야 된다 그런 뜻으로 이해가 되네요.
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 맞습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 최근 일각에서 한동훈 전 위원장 출마할 가능성이 있니, 없니 그냥 막 다른 사람들끼리 서로 갑론을박하고 그런 얘기들이 나오는데 일단 한동훈 전 위원장 당대표 경선에 뛰어들 거라고 보시는지. 이게 이제 바람직하다고 보시는지. 어떻게 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 그런데 이제 역대급 참패에 대해서 좀 충격을 받으셨을 것 같아요, 또 책임론도 제기되고. 그래서 좀 출마가 쉽지 않을 거다 이런 생각을 가지고 있습니다. 본인 성찰할 시기가 아니냐. 성찰하고 계시겠다 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 원내대표로는 이철규 의원이 거론되고 있습니다. 그런데 이상하게 후보군에 있는 다른 의원들이 아직 출마 의사 밝히는 분을 제가 찾지 못했거든요. 그래서 5월 3일 경선일을 9일로 늦췄다고, 연기했다고 하는데 왜 이렇게 원내대표에 다른 분들이 뛰어들지 않을까요?
▶ 윤상현 : 그러니까 이게 참 문제입니다. 좀 우리 원내대표에 뜻이 있는 분은 소신 갖고 나와라, 정말. 어떤 분위기 살피지 마라 이런 얘기를 하고 싶습니다. 소위 말해서 이철규 의원이 나온다고 하니까 친윤계의 어떤 강한 스크럼을 의식하고 소신을 못 펼치는데 정치는 소신껏 해라 이런 말씀을 꼭 드리고 싶어요. 그래서 친윤계의 어떤 스크럼 또 이제 여소야대 상황에서의 어떤 어려움 이런 것 때문에 그런 것 같은데 소신껏 던져라 이런 말씀을 꼭 드리고 싶습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그런데 의원님께서는 이철규 의원 원내대표설에 대해서 그전에는 ‘벌을 받아야 할 분’ 이런 취지의 비판을 하셨다가 어제는 ‘용산과 소통하기에 편한 분’ 이런 말씀을 하셨어요.
▶ 윤상현 : 그거는 이제 용산하고 이철규 의원 관계를 설명하면서 이제 관계 속에서 그분의 책임감이나 소통이나 이런 거에 대해서 이제 얘기를 한 거거든요.
▷ 전종철 : 장점이 있을 수도 있다?
▶ 윤상현 : 기본적으로 장점이 있지만 일단 기본적으로 이철규 의원 같은 경우에는 총선 패배에 책임이 있는 분이기 때문에 상보다는 벌을 받아야 할 분이다 이런 얘기를 했거든요. 그래서 이분이 뭐 이제 악역을 자처하겠다 하는데 진짜 악역이라는 것은 총선 참패에 책임을 지고 백의종군 선언하는 거 그게 진짜 악역일 것 같다는 생각이 듭니다.
▷ 전종철 : 누가 될지 모르겠지만 차기 원내대표는 어떤 걸 잘해야 된다고 보세요? 당부하고 싶으신 말씀 있으세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 차기 원내대표는 일단 여소야대 상황하에서 참 어렵지 않습니까. 원내대표는 기본적으로 협상력, 투쟁력 양자를 가져야 됩니다. 협상도 잘하고 투쟁도 잘하고 그러면서도 어떤 대중적인 어필, 대중적인 호소력도 있어야 되고요. 또 하나 중요한 것도 이철규 의원이 장점을 가겠습니다만 대통령실, 물론 정진석 비서실장을 통해서 하겠습니다만 기본적인 어떤 소통, 정무적인 판단 능력 이런 것도 필요하지 않을까 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 민주당 원내대표는 박찬대 의원으로 굳어지는 모양새입니다. 이재명 대표 연임설에도 무게가 실리고 있고요. 더구나 국회의장 경선도 이른바 선명성 경쟁, 명심 경쟁 양상입니다. 완벽한 친명 체제 구축 국민의힘 입장에서는 어떻습니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 완전한 친명 체제 구축하는 게 정말로 이제 민주당한테 도움이 될까? 완전히 여기는 이제 이재명의 민주당입니다. 이재명의 민주당이 아니라 민주당이 잘되기 위해서는 민주당의 이재명으로 가야 되거든요. 그래서 이재명의 민주당으로 간다는 것은 일사불란한 당으로 가는 거고요.
▷ 전종철 : 결코 민주당에도 이롭지 않다?
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 당내 민주주의, 정당 정치 발전 측면에서 이게 옳은가 하는 의심을 갖고 있고요. 그래서 친명 체제든 뭐 그게 비명 체제든 우리는 항상 오직 국민 위해서 싸우고 협상할 준비가 돼 있다 이런 입장일 겁니다.
▷ 전종철 : 민주당은 5월 국회에서 특히 당장 내일 본회의에서 채상병 특검법, 전세사기특별법 통과시켜야 한다는 입장입니다. 여당 내에서도 채상병 특검법은 이거 수용해야 하는 것 아니냐 이런 의견들이 좀 있는데요. 어떻게 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 채상병 특검법 사실 그분의 순직에 대해서 당연히 진실을 밝히고 수사 외압에 대해서 당연히 진실을 밝혀야 됩니다. 그것은 절대적인 명제입니다. 그런데 지금 공수처에서 채상병의 수사 외압 이거에 대해서 활발히 지금 수사를 하고 있거든요. 그래서 이거 하고 있는데 특검 하자? 이거는 절차적인 준비가 안 돼 있다. 절차적으로 아직 미숙한 단계다.
▷ 전종철 : 공수처 수사 결과는 지켜보자.
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 그거를 보고 그다음에 특검 그게 옳거든요. 그래서 공수처라는 게 누가 만든 겁니까? 현재 민주당이 지난 문재인 정부 때 만든 겁니다. 아니, 이걸 만들어 놓고 여기서 활발히 지금 수사하고 있는데 이걸 팽개치고 아니, 특검으로 가자? 이걸 어떻게 설명할 수 있겠습니까. 그래서 절차적인 미성숙 하자가 있다 이런 입장입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 본회의가 열려서 채상병 특검법 통과되면 그 이후 상황 어떻게 전개될지 관심입니다. 윤 대통령이 거부권 행사할 거라고 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 사실 거부권 행사라고 하는데 거부권이라고 하니까 뭔가 좀 맨날 거부 이미지만 쌓이는 것 같고.
▷ 전종철 : 재의요구권.
▶ 윤상현 : 이게 한마디로 재의요구권입니다. 재의요구권은 헌법상의 대통령의 당연한 권리고요. 그래서 이게 아마도 이런 여러 가지 법적인 하자, 절차의 미성숙 등을 이유로 아마 원내지도부가 대통령한테 건의할 겁니다. 건의를 하면 이제 대통령이 다시 재의요구를 하지 않겠나 이렇게 봅니다.
▷ 전종철 : 정치권 대표 외교통이시기도 합니다. 그래서 외교 현안 좀 여쭤볼게요. 조태열 외교부 장관이 첫 중국 방문을 논의하고 있는 것으로 전해졌습니다. 한·중·일 3국 정상회의 개최 추진에 대한 소통도 아마 있을 거다 이런 관측도 나오는데요. 그간 상대적으로 소원해진 한중 관계 어떻게 풀어나가야 합니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 한중 관계가 소원해졌다고 하는데 사실 우리가 한중 관계도 대단히 중요하게 생각을 합니다. 정말 한미 동맹만큼 한중 관계도 아주 중요하게 생각을 하는데 사실 문재인 정부 때 완전한 비핵화, 한반도에 완전한 비핵화를 했지만 거꾸로 가지 않았습니까. 북한은 완전한 핵무장을 시켜 놨습니다. 그러면 고도화되는 북핵 미사일 위협에 대항하기 위해서는 우리는 한미 동맹을 개선시킬 수밖에 없습니다. 또 일본하고의 군사 협력도 필요할 수밖에 없습니다. 그래서 한·미·일 간의 군사 협력을 제도화시키고 고도화시키는 것에 대해서 당연히 중국은 그거에 대해서 불편할 수밖에 없죠. 이럴 때일수록 어떻게 해야 되느냐. 우리의 진정성을 전달해야 됩니다. 진정성을 전달하는 건 뭐냐. 전략 대화입니다, 전략 대화. 그래서 저는 계속해서 한국과 중국 간에 전략 대화를 하자. 전략 대화를 주창 얘기를 하고 있거든요. 그런데 전략 대화의 모멘텀을 계속 찾아가야 되고요. 재작년에 11월인가 시진핑 주석하고 발리에서 만났고요. 또 작년에도 대통령이 리창도 만났고요. 지금 조태열 장관이 이제 중국으로 들어가고 아주 좋은 모멘텀이 언제냐 하면 다음 달 말에 결국 이제. 아니죠, 다음 달 말이 아니라 이제 이번 달 말이죠, 5월. 5월 1일이니까 이번 달 말에 한중일 정상회의를 우리 한국에서 주최를 하게 됩니다. 그때 우리가 왕이 외교부장, 외사판공실 주임하고 우리의 진정성을 전달하자. 그래서 우리의 책임자하고, 대통령도 아마 만나시겠죠. 대통령하고 장관하고 왕이 외교부장한테 우리의 어떤 전략 대화에 대한 의지를 강하게 피력해야 된다 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 간밤 외신을 보니까 트럼프 전 대통령이 타임 인터뷰에서 주한미군 철수 가능성을 또 시사했습니다. 만약 트럼프가 재집권하게 된다면 우리 정부 특히 어떤 점에 신경 써서 미리 대처를 해야 될까요?
▶ 윤상현 : 트럼프는 지난번에도 지난 정부 때도 주한미군 철수에 대해서 계속 얘기를 했습니다. 그래서 주변에 있는 매티스 국방장관이나 펜스 부통령이나 그거에 대해서 반대를 해온 게 사실이고요. 사실 최근에 트럼프 주변의 참모진들 엘브리지 콜비라고 있습니다. 국방부 부차관보를 했는데 이분이 백악관 안보보좌관이 될 가능성이 큰 사람인데 이 사람이 뭐냐 하면 주한미군의 역할을 한반도 방위를 넘어서서 중국 견제 역할을 하면서 한반도의 자체 핵무장을 허용하자라기까지 돼 있습니다. 이게 트럼프가 들어서면 반드시 북한 핵 폐기가 아니라 북핵 관리로 들어옵니다. 그거는 거의 저는 거의 확실하다고 봅니다.
▷ 전종철 : 폐기를 요구하지 않고 이제 그걸 갖고 어느 수준에서 딜을 한다 이거죠?
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 핵 동결을 시도하고 너희 여기서 동결한 다음에 핵 확산하지 마. 우리가 그러면서 결국은 북한을 사실상 핵보유국으로 인정하는 그런 시나리오가 전개될 것입니다. 그때 우리는 어떻게 해야 되느냐. 저는 줄기차게 얘기하는 게 우리도 그때는 제한적 의미의 자체 핵무장을 하자. 핵무장할 수밖에 없습니다, 우리도. 왜 제가 제한적 의미라고 말씀을 드리냐면 그 핵이라는 게 결국 북핵 폐기를 전제로 한 같은 핵 폐기입니다. 북한의 핵 때문에 우리가 핵무장을 하지만 북핵 폐기를 할 때 우리의 핵도 당연히 동시에 폐기하는 제한적 의미의 자체 핵무장하자 이런 시나리오를 저는 생각하고 그거에 대한 대비를 해야 된다 이런 말씀을 꼭 드리고 싶습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 네, 오늘은 여기까지 듣겠습니다. 윤상현 국민의힘 의원이었습니다. 감사합니다.

- 입력 2024-05-01 10:07:30
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 안녕하세요. 윤상현입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 접전 끝에 승리하면서 5선 고지에 올랐습니다. 늦었지만 축하드립니다.
▶ 윤상현 : 감사합니다.
▷ 전종철 : 거센 정권 심판론 바람 속에서 또다시 살아 돌아오신 이유 뭐라고 보십니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 그런데 이게 보통 선거는 바람과 구도의 싸움이라고 했는데 이번에는 정권 심판의 바람이 너무너무 셌습니다. 제 지역의 민주당 후보가 3, 4개월 전에 저하고 17% 차이가 났는데 선거 가까이 오면서 거의 박빙으로 왔거든요. 제 지역이 이러는데 다른 지역은 어떻겠나. 정말로 대참패다 이런 예감이 왔고요. 살아온 이유를 얘기하면 어떤 저의 진정성의 전달이 아닌가 이런 생각을 합니다. 왜냐하면 저는 좀 정치하는 목적이 남다른 목적을 가지고 있습니다. 제가 국제정치학 또 공부도 해보고 교수 생활을 해보고 현실 정치하면서 대한민국에 필요한 정치의 개념이 반드시 따로 있을 거다. 그 개념을 한번 내리고 싶거든요. 그래서 좀 색다른 정치 실험을 하는데 일단 기본적으로 사람 위에 사람 없고 사람 밑에 사람 없다. 사람은 거의 똑같다, 계급적 측면에서 말씀드리면. 그래서 전 계급적 인간이 되자 이런 신념을 가지고 있고 또 *** 반드시 있을 거다. 그건 바로 사람입니다. 사람이 가장 중요하다. 그래서 당보다는 사람, 이념보다는 사람 이게 가장 기본적인 인식이 돼 있고요. 또 정치라는 게 기본적으로 서비스다 이 생각을 가지고 이제 행동하다 보니까 어떤 그게 전달이 되지 않았나 이런 생각을 해봅니다.
▷ 전종철 : 사람 중심 정치, 서비스 정치 말씀해주셨고요.
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 맞습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 개인적으로는 기쁘시겠지만 당 상황이 좋지 않습니다. 그러다 보니 당에 쓴 소리 많이 하고 계십니다. 야권에 192석 갖다 바치고도 이렇게 한가하냐 꼬집기도 했고요. 국민의힘에서 이렇게 위기감, 절박함 부족한 이유 뭐라고 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 일단은 수도권에 비해서 너무 모르는 겁니다. 수도권 감수성이라고 할까요? 수도권에 대한 현실 인식이 너무 없고요. 이게 기본적으로 수도권이라는 게 공천받는다고 당선되는 게 아니라 오히려 떨어질 확률이 큰 수도권이거든요. 그런데 우리 당의 기본적인 분위기는 수도권을 겁냅니다. 예를 들어서 수도권에서 떨어지면 일단 영남으로 갑니다. 수도권은 포기하는 거예요. 그리고 완전히 아예 영남으로 가거든요. 아예 이런 인식이 많이 만연돼 있는 것 같아요. 그래서 기본적으로 이게 민주당하고 다른 게 뭐냐 하면 민주당 한번 보십시오. 민주당은 호남을 기반으로 하면서도 수도권으로 확장하지 않습니까? 수도권 당 지도부, 수도권 원내지도부가 들어가는데 대단히 전략적인. 우리는 전략적이지를 못해요. 영남 중심의 어떤 당의 한계를 탈피를 못하고 있다.
▷ 전종철 : 그런 것이 크다.
▶ 윤상현 : 이게 결국은 위원들의 우리들의 어떤 사고방식부터 바꿔야 되지 않나 이런 생각이 듭니다.
▷ 전종철 : 영수회담 평가해보겠습니다. 윤석열 대통령과 이재명 대표의 첫 영수회담 점수 매긴다면 몇 점 주시겠습니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 저는 그래도 이제 시작이 반이다라는 속담이 있으니까 한 50점은 될 수 있지 않나. 왜냐하면 이제 좀 첫술에 배부를 수는 없죠, 물론. 그러나 미흡한 점이 있지만 여야의 최고 지도자들이 2년 만에 만나서 대화하고 경청의 자리를 가졌다. 그래서 일단 대화의 물꼬, 소통의 물꼬를 텄다 이런 면에서 한 50점은 줘야 되지 않나 이런 생각을 합니다.
▷ 전종철 : 정치적 손익계산서 볼 때 그러면 윤 대통령과 이 대표도 좀 실익이 없지는 않았다고 보시는 거네요.
▶ 윤상현 : 이제 일단은 두 분이 중요한 게 여러 가지, 이재명 대표가 한 10가지 세부적 의제를 말씀하셔서 다 들어주지 않았습니다만 일단 의료 개혁의 필요성 또 의대 증원이 불가피하다라는 것에 대해서 두 분이 인식을 같이 했거든요. 연금 개혁도 의지를 같이 했고 또 앞으로 만나기로 했고요. 그래서 윤 대통령에 있어서는 이제 어느 정도 의료 개혁 등 현안에 대해서 야권 지도자, 최고 지도자의 지지를 이끌어냈고요. 제가 보기에 또 우리 이재명 대표도 어떤 대통령한테 하고 싶은 말씀을 전부 다 하고 또 일종의 이제 국정의 파트너로서 인정을 받은 거죠. 이런 게 좀 있지 않나 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 회담 후에 야당은 ‘대통령이 민생 회복과 국정 기조 전환 받아들이지 않았다, 회담을 했어도 변화가 없다, 상황 인식이 안이하다, 향후 국정이 우려된다.’ 이렇게 공식 입장을 내놨는데 반면에 이재명 대표는 ‘답답하고 아쉽다’면서도 ‘소통의 첫 장을 열었다는 데 의미를 두겠다.’ 이런 얘기를 했어요. 그래서 이제 첫 회동에서 소통 물꼬를 텄다면 다음에 이제 협치의 불씨를 살려야 할 텐데 그러면 다음 회동에서는 어떻게 하면 좋을까요?
▶ 윤상현 : 일단은 이제 다음 회동을 위해서는 좀 세부적인 준비가 있어야 될 것 같아요. 예를 들어서 어떤 내용적인 성숙, 예를 들어서 우리 대통령께서 민생을 위한 여야정 협의체를 제안하지 않았습니까? 여야정 협의체, 그러니까 과거에도 그런 선례가 많거든요. 그래서 여야정 협의체를 통해서 어떤 여야 간에 먼저 실무적인 논의를 하고 또 그다음에 회동을 하고 이렇게 하면 좋을 것 같아요, 저는.
▷ 전종철 : 이게 대통령이 제의를 하긴 했는데 이재명 대표는 약간 국회에서 또 할 영역이 있다 이러고 약간 아직은 좀 보고 있는 것 같아요.
▶ 윤상현 : 아직은 보고 있는데 예를 들어서 국회에서 보면 일단 민주당 단독으로 모든 일을 할 수 있는 상황 아닙니까. 괜히 여야정 협의체에 갔다가 어떤 부담을 같이 나눠 질까 봐, 또 그쪽 입장에서는 또 여당의 어떤 작전이나 시간 끌기에 당하지 않나 이런 의구심이 있을 수 있지 않습니까. 그런데 현재 여소야대 상황에서 협치라는 것은 선택이 아닌 필수입니다. 대통령이나 여당은 무조건 야당하고 소통, 협치할 수밖에 없습니다. 그래서 어떤 여당에 대한 믿음을 가지고 민생협의체를 한번 받아주셨으면 하는 그런 바람을 가지고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 이달에 아마도 오래지 않아서 윤 대통령 취임 2주년 기자회견 실시할 것으로 알려졌고요. 지금 기류 긍정적인 것 같기는 합니다만 만약 실제로 기자회견이 열린다면 어떤 메시지가 담겨야 한다고 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 그런데 대통령께서 그동안 국민적인 기대에 못 미친 부분이 많지 않습니까. 그런 부분에 대한 진정성 있는 성찰이 있어야 될 것 같고요. 그런 거에 대해서 대통령께서 앞으로 어떻게 하시겠다. 예를 들어서 또 이번 총선 참패의 의미라는 것을 이제 말씀 주시고 또 국민 눈높이에 맞는 소통의 방식이라든지 민심을 받드는 정부의 모습을 보여주겠다 이런 약속도 하시고 이런 식으로 가지 않을까 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 국민의힘은 이번 주에 황우여 비상대책위원회를 출범시킬 예정입니다. 황우여 비대위 카드 어떻게 평가하세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 그런데 저는 이제 황우여 비대위원장은 저는 계속해서 관리형 비대위가 아니라 혁신형 비대위가 들어와야 된다. 대참패를 겪어서 우리가 반성 또 사죄 그리고 혁신의 모습을 보여야 된다고 했는데 일단.
▷ 전종철 : 단순히 전당대회만 준비하는 게 아니다, 지금은.
▶ 윤상현 : 맞습니다. 그래서 이제 당 지도부가 관리형 비대위도 하고 또 비대위원장을 황우여 전 대표님을 모셨는데 이분 뭐 개인적으로 저하고 친하고.
▷ 전종철 : 아니, 인천 지역구도 같이 하셨잖아요.
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 옆쪽 구셨고요. 경륜 있고 합리적이고 또 온건한 분인데 관리형 비대위원장으로서는 좋은 분인 건 사실입니다, 관리형 비대위원장으로서는.
▷ 전종철 : 그런 면에서는 평가를 하시고요. 조금 아쉬운 점도 있다는 말씀하시는데 지금 비대위 인선 작업 아마 진행되고 있을 겁니다. 수도권 중도층 민심 제대로 반영하기 위해서 수도권 원외 조직위원장들 좀 들어가야 하는 거 아니냐 이런 얘기 있는데 동의하세요
▶ 윤상현 : 물론 그렇습니다. 예, 동의하는데 일단 우리 황우여 대표에 대해서 좀 부연 설명을 하면 관리형 비대위원장으로 오셨지만 저는 그분한테 좀 혁신형 비대위원장 역할도 같이 해달라. 그래서 통합형으로 해달라. 지금은 혁신과 반성과 자성의 시기고 또 총선백서도 만들고 또 어떤 전대 룰도 개정하고 이런 걸 해야 된다라고 꼭 주문해주고 싶고요. 일단은 이제 원외위원장들을 보면 정말로 훌륭한 분들이 많습니다. 그래서 이분들이 우리 당이 가진 문제점이나 또 앞으로 갈 방향이나 또 이제 쇄신, 혁신의 과제들을 잘 알고 있거든요. 당연히 이분들이 들어가셔야 됩니다.
▷ 전종철 : 당대표 선출을 위한 룰 바꿔야 된다고 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 당연히 바꿔야 됩니다.
▷ 전종철 : 민심 반영하는 걸로요?
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 당이라는 게 민심의 바다 위에 떠 있는 배거든요. 그래서 이번에는 민심의 회초리를 맞았기 때문에 민심에 순응하는 변화된 모습을 보여줘야 한다 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 시간이 지금 좀 남았습니다만 지금 생각하시기에 당대표 출마하십니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 아닙니다. 지금은 당대표 얘기할 때가 아니고요. 지금은 어떻든지 혁신의 타임입니다. 혁신의 타임입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그러니까 혁신과 반성의 모습을 국민들에게 보여줄 시기지 지금 내가 당대표 나온다. 지금 뭐 부인하는 것은 아니고 여하튼 그런 걸 생각할 시기가 지금 아니다 그런 뜻이죠?
▶ 윤상현 : 지금은 아닙니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그렇다면 차기 당대표는 혁신 얘기도 하셨지만 어떤 자격을 갖춘 분이 와야 됩니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 저는요. 우리 당의 현재 정신이 뭐냐. 시대 정신이 뭐냐면 혁신입니다, 혁신. 혁신과 쇄신. 혁신 당대표. 그러면 혁신의 이미지를 가지고 결국 보수의 가치를 재정립해야 합니다. 혁신 보수의 가치가 뭔지. 사실 보수가 너무나도 꼴통 보수같이 돼 있거든요. 그래서 혁신 보수의 가치를 정립하고요. 그리고 어떤 우리 당의 잘못된 체제, 병패들을 좀 개선하고요. 병패 보면 뭐 뺄셈 정치의 DNA, 이익집단화되는 DNA, 예를 들어서 군림하는 DNA 저는 한 세 가지로 정의를 합니다만 이런 것을 탈피하고 또 어떤 수도권 중도로서 외연 확장하는 그런 가능성 그런 비전을 제시하는 대표가 돼야 된다 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 중도 외연 확장. 아까 이제 뺄셈 정치를 극복하고 덧셈 정치 얘기는 그동안 많이 하셨었어요.
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 많이 해왔습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 혁신 보수의 가치 이건 좌표 설정을 확실히 다시 해야 된다 그런 뜻으로 이해가 되네요.
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 맞습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 최근 일각에서 한동훈 전 위원장 출마할 가능성이 있니, 없니 그냥 막 다른 사람들끼리 서로 갑론을박하고 그런 얘기들이 나오는데 일단 한동훈 전 위원장 당대표 경선에 뛰어들 거라고 보시는지. 이게 이제 바람직하다고 보시는지. 어떻게 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 그런데 이제 역대급 참패에 대해서 좀 충격을 받으셨을 것 같아요, 또 책임론도 제기되고. 그래서 좀 출마가 쉽지 않을 거다 이런 생각을 가지고 있습니다. 본인 성찰할 시기가 아니냐. 성찰하고 계시겠다 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 원내대표로는 이철규 의원이 거론되고 있습니다. 그런데 이상하게 후보군에 있는 다른 의원들이 아직 출마 의사 밝히는 분을 제가 찾지 못했거든요. 그래서 5월 3일 경선일을 9일로 늦췄다고, 연기했다고 하는데 왜 이렇게 원내대표에 다른 분들이 뛰어들지 않을까요?
▶ 윤상현 : 그러니까 이게 참 문제입니다. 좀 우리 원내대표에 뜻이 있는 분은 소신 갖고 나와라, 정말. 어떤 분위기 살피지 마라 이런 얘기를 하고 싶습니다. 소위 말해서 이철규 의원이 나온다고 하니까 친윤계의 어떤 강한 스크럼을 의식하고 소신을 못 펼치는데 정치는 소신껏 해라 이런 말씀을 꼭 드리고 싶어요. 그래서 친윤계의 어떤 스크럼 또 이제 여소야대 상황에서의 어떤 어려움 이런 것 때문에 그런 것 같은데 소신껏 던져라 이런 말씀을 꼭 드리고 싶습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 그런데 의원님께서는 이철규 의원 원내대표설에 대해서 그전에는 ‘벌을 받아야 할 분’ 이런 취지의 비판을 하셨다가 어제는 ‘용산과 소통하기에 편한 분’ 이런 말씀을 하셨어요.
▶ 윤상현 : 그거는 이제 용산하고 이철규 의원 관계를 설명하면서 이제 관계 속에서 그분의 책임감이나 소통이나 이런 거에 대해서 이제 얘기를 한 거거든요.
▷ 전종철 : 장점이 있을 수도 있다?
▶ 윤상현 : 기본적으로 장점이 있지만 일단 기본적으로 이철규 의원 같은 경우에는 총선 패배에 책임이 있는 분이기 때문에 상보다는 벌을 받아야 할 분이다 이런 얘기를 했거든요. 그래서 이분이 뭐 이제 악역을 자처하겠다 하는데 진짜 악역이라는 것은 총선 참패에 책임을 지고 백의종군 선언하는 거 그게 진짜 악역일 것 같다는 생각이 듭니다.
▷ 전종철 : 누가 될지 모르겠지만 차기 원내대표는 어떤 걸 잘해야 된다고 보세요? 당부하고 싶으신 말씀 있으세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 차기 원내대표는 일단 여소야대 상황하에서 참 어렵지 않습니까. 원내대표는 기본적으로 협상력, 투쟁력 양자를 가져야 됩니다. 협상도 잘하고 투쟁도 잘하고 그러면서도 어떤 대중적인 어필, 대중적인 호소력도 있어야 되고요. 또 하나 중요한 것도 이철규 의원이 장점을 가겠습니다만 대통령실, 물론 정진석 비서실장을 통해서 하겠습니다만 기본적인 어떤 소통, 정무적인 판단 능력 이런 것도 필요하지 않을까 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 민주당 원내대표는 박찬대 의원으로 굳어지는 모양새입니다. 이재명 대표 연임설에도 무게가 실리고 있고요. 더구나 국회의장 경선도 이른바 선명성 경쟁, 명심 경쟁 양상입니다. 완벽한 친명 체제 구축 국민의힘 입장에서는 어떻습니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 완전한 친명 체제 구축하는 게 정말로 이제 민주당한테 도움이 될까? 완전히 여기는 이제 이재명의 민주당입니다. 이재명의 민주당이 아니라 민주당이 잘되기 위해서는 민주당의 이재명으로 가야 되거든요. 그래서 이재명의 민주당으로 간다는 것은 일사불란한 당으로 가는 거고요.
▷ 전종철 : 결코 민주당에도 이롭지 않다?
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 당내 민주주의, 정당 정치 발전 측면에서 이게 옳은가 하는 의심을 갖고 있고요. 그래서 친명 체제든 뭐 그게 비명 체제든 우리는 항상 오직 국민 위해서 싸우고 협상할 준비가 돼 있다 이런 입장일 겁니다.
▷ 전종철 : 민주당은 5월 국회에서 특히 당장 내일 본회의에서 채상병 특검법, 전세사기특별법 통과시켜야 한다는 입장입니다. 여당 내에서도 채상병 특검법은 이거 수용해야 하는 것 아니냐 이런 의견들이 좀 있는데요. 어떻게 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 채상병 특검법 사실 그분의 순직에 대해서 당연히 진실을 밝히고 수사 외압에 대해서 당연히 진실을 밝혀야 됩니다. 그것은 절대적인 명제입니다. 그런데 지금 공수처에서 채상병의 수사 외압 이거에 대해서 활발히 지금 수사를 하고 있거든요. 그래서 이거 하고 있는데 특검 하자? 이거는 절차적인 준비가 안 돼 있다. 절차적으로 아직 미숙한 단계다.
▷ 전종철 : 공수처 수사 결과는 지켜보자.
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 그거를 보고 그다음에 특검 그게 옳거든요. 그래서 공수처라는 게 누가 만든 겁니까? 현재 민주당이 지난 문재인 정부 때 만든 겁니다. 아니, 이걸 만들어 놓고 여기서 활발히 지금 수사하고 있는데 이걸 팽개치고 아니, 특검으로 가자? 이걸 어떻게 설명할 수 있겠습니까. 그래서 절차적인 미성숙 하자가 있다 이런 입장입니다.
▷ 전종철 : 본회의가 열려서 채상병 특검법 통과되면 그 이후 상황 어떻게 전개될지 관심입니다. 윤 대통령이 거부권 행사할 거라고 보세요?
▶ 윤상현 : 사실 거부권 행사라고 하는데 거부권이라고 하니까 뭔가 좀 맨날 거부 이미지만 쌓이는 것 같고.
▷ 전종철 : 재의요구권.
▶ 윤상현 : 이게 한마디로 재의요구권입니다. 재의요구권은 헌법상의 대통령의 당연한 권리고요. 그래서 이게 아마도 이런 여러 가지 법적인 하자, 절차의 미성숙 등을 이유로 아마 원내지도부가 대통령한테 건의할 겁니다. 건의를 하면 이제 대통령이 다시 재의요구를 하지 않겠나 이렇게 봅니다.
▷ 전종철 : 정치권 대표 외교통이시기도 합니다. 그래서 외교 현안 좀 여쭤볼게요. 조태열 외교부 장관이 첫 중국 방문을 논의하고 있는 것으로 전해졌습니다. 한·중·일 3국 정상회의 개최 추진에 대한 소통도 아마 있을 거다 이런 관측도 나오는데요. 그간 상대적으로 소원해진 한중 관계 어떻게 풀어나가야 합니까?
▶ 윤상현 : 한중 관계가 소원해졌다고 하는데 사실 우리가 한중 관계도 대단히 중요하게 생각을 합니다. 정말 한미 동맹만큼 한중 관계도 아주 중요하게 생각을 하는데 사실 문재인 정부 때 완전한 비핵화, 한반도에 완전한 비핵화를 했지만 거꾸로 가지 않았습니까. 북한은 완전한 핵무장을 시켜 놨습니다. 그러면 고도화되는 북핵 미사일 위협에 대항하기 위해서는 우리는 한미 동맹을 개선시킬 수밖에 없습니다. 또 일본하고의 군사 협력도 필요할 수밖에 없습니다. 그래서 한·미·일 간의 군사 협력을 제도화시키고 고도화시키는 것에 대해서 당연히 중국은 그거에 대해서 불편할 수밖에 없죠. 이럴 때일수록 어떻게 해야 되느냐. 우리의 진정성을 전달해야 됩니다. 진정성을 전달하는 건 뭐냐. 전략 대화입니다, 전략 대화. 그래서 저는 계속해서 한국과 중국 간에 전략 대화를 하자. 전략 대화를 주창 얘기를 하고 있거든요. 그런데 전략 대화의 모멘텀을 계속 찾아가야 되고요. 재작년에 11월인가 시진핑 주석하고 발리에서 만났고요. 또 작년에도 대통령이 리창도 만났고요. 지금 조태열 장관이 이제 중국으로 들어가고 아주 좋은 모멘텀이 언제냐 하면 다음 달 말에 결국 이제. 아니죠, 다음 달 말이 아니라 이제 이번 달 말이죠, 5월. 5월 1일이니까 이번 달 말에 한중일 정상회의를 우리 한국에서 주최를 하게 됩니다. 그때 우리가 왕이 외교부장, 외사판공실 주임하고 우리의 진정성을 전달하자. 그래서 우리의 책임자하고, 대통령도 아마 만나시겠죠. 대통령하고 장관하고 왕이 외교부장한테 우리의 어떤 전략 대화에 대한 의지를 강하게 피력해야 된다 이렇게 보고 있습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 간밤 외신을 보니까 트럼프 전 대통령이 타임 인터뷰에서 주한미군 철수 가능성을 또 시사했습니다. 만약 트럼프가 재집권하게 된다면 우리 정부 특히 어떤 점에 신경 써서 미리 대처를 해야 될까요?
▶ 윤상현 : 트럼프는 지난번에도 지난 정부 때도 주한미군 철수에 대해서 계속 얘기를 했습니다. 그래서 주변에 있는 매티스 국방장관이나 펜스 부통령이나 그거에 대해서 반대를 해온 게 사실이고요. 사실 최근에 트럼프 주변의 참모진들 엘브리지 콜비라고 있습니다. 국방부 부차관보를 했는데 이분이 백악관 안보보좌관이 될 가능성이 큰 사람인데 이 사람이 뭐냐 하면 주한미군의 역할을 한반도 방위를 넘어서서 중국 견제 역할을 하면서 한반도의 자체 핵무장을 허용하자라기까지 돼 있습니다. 이게 트럼프가 들어서면 반드시 북한 핵 폐기가 아니라 북핵 관리로 들어옵니다. 그거는 거의 저는 거의 확실하다고 봅니다.
▷ 전종철 : 폐기를 요구하지 않고 이제 그걸 갖고 어느 수준에서 딜을 한다 이거죠?
▶ 윤상현 : 네, 핵 동결을 시도하고 너희 여기서 동결한 다음에 핵 확산하지 마. 우리가 그러면서 결국은 북한을 사실상 핵보유국으로 인정하는 그런 시나리오가 전개될 것입니다. 그때 우리는 어떻게 해야 되느냐. 저는 줄기차게 얘기하는 게 우리도 그때는 제한적 의미의 자체 핵무장을 하자. 핵무장할 수밖에 없습니다, 우리도. 왜 제가 제한적 의미라고 말씀을 드리냐면 그 핵이라는 게 결국 북핵 폐기를 전제로 한 같은 핵 폐기입니다. 북한의 핵 때문에 우리가 핵무장을 하지만 북핵 폐기를 할 때 우리의 핵도 당연히 동시에 폐기하는 제한적 의미의 자체 핵무장하자 이런 시나리오를 저는 생각하고 그거에 대한 대비를 해야 된다 이런 말씀을 꼭 드리고 싶습니다.
▷ 전종철 : 네, 오늘은 여기까지 듣겠습니다. 윤상현 국민의힘 의원이었습니다. 감사합니다.

Article: 우크라 남부 오데사에 또 미사일…“러시아 공격에 3명 사망”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
현지 시각 1일 로이터·AFP통신에 따르면 오데사주 당국은 이날 새벽 러시아의 미사일이 오데사를 공습해 3명이 사망하고 3명이 다쳤다고 밝혔습니다.
올레흐 키페르 오데사 주지사는 이날 텔레그램을 통해 이번 공격은 탄도미사일에 의한 것으로, 민간 시설이 피해를 입었다고 설명했습니다. 그러나 그 이상의 자세한 정보는 공개하지 않았습니다.
불과 이틀 전에도 오데사에서는 러시아의 폭격으로 다수의 사상자가 나왔습니다.
지난달 29일 오후 오데사 학교와 주거용 건물 등 민간 시설에 미사일이 떨어져 5명이 숨지고 30여 명이 다쳤습니다.
일간 키이우포스트 등 현지 매체는 집속탄 탄두가 탑재된 러시아군의 이스칸데르-M 미사일이 해안가 건물에 명중해 큰불이 나면서 희생자가 늘었다고 보도했습니다. 이 건물은 현지인들이 ‘해리포터 성’이라고 칭하는 곳입니다.
이날 사용된 것으로 알려진 집속탄은 투하된 어미폭탄이 새끼폭탄 수백 개를 지상에 흩뿌려 광범위하고 무차별적인 공격을 가하는 형태의 무기로, 다량의 인명 살상을 목표로 한다는 점에서 비인도적이라는 지적을 받습니다.
러시아는 오데사 외에도 최근 우크라이나 수도 키이우와 제2 도시 하르키우 등 우크라이나 주요 도시에 대해 대규모 공습을 단행하는 등 오는 9일 전승절을 앞두고 공격 강도를 부쩍 끌어올리고 있습니다.
지난달 11일에는 키이우와 하르키우 등의 주요 에너지 시설과 남부의 자포리자와 오데사, 서부 르비우의 인프라 시설을 상대로도 공격을 감행한 바 있습니다.

Article: 여야, ‘5월 임시국회’ 의사 일정 협상 ‘줄다리기’
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
국회에서는 21대 국회 마지막 임시국회 의사 일정을 놓고 여야의 줄다리기가 계속되고 있습니다.
민주당은 내일 본회의를 열어 해병대원 특검법 등을 처리하겠다고 거듭 압박했는데 여당은 민생과 관련 없는 법안 처리엔 응할 수 없다며 맞섰습니다.
추재훈 기자입니다.
[리포트]
21대 국회 임기가 이제 한 달 남은 상황.
처리해야 할 법안들이 산적해 있지만 여야는 평행선만 달리고 있습니다.
더불어민주당 요구로 5월 임시국회가 소집됐는데 본회의 일정을 못 잡고 있는 겁니다.
민주당은 21대 국회에서 해병대원 특검법과 전세 사기 특별법 등을 처리하자고 거듭 압박했습니다.
[홍익표/더불어민주당 원내대표 : "이것을 처리하지 않으면 21대 국회는 정말 국민들에게 면목이 없게 될 겁니다. 5월 2일 국회 반드시 열게 만들 겁니다."]
이태원 참사 특별법 재의결을 촉구하는 목소리도 나왔습니다.
[남인순/더불어민주당 의원 : "여야 선배, 동료 국회의원들에게 촉구합니다. 5월 국회에서 이태원 참사 특별법 재의결합시다. 압도적 찬성으로 반드시 통과시킵시다."]
국회법상 특별한 사정이 없으면 매주 목요일에 본회의를 열어야 한다는 게 민주당 입장입니다.
이에 대해 국민의힘은 고준위방폐물법처럼 시급한 법안 처리를 위한 것이라면 모르겠지만 민생과 관련 없는 본회의는 열 수 없다고 맞서고 있습니다.
[윤재옥/국민의힘 대표 권한대행 겸 원내대표 : "정쟁을 유발할 수 있는 그런 법안들을 처리하겠다는 본회의는 동의하기 어렵습니다."]
공수처 수사가 진행 중인 해병대원 사건 관련 특검법은 물론 민주유공자법 등 민주당이 단독으로 본회의에 직회부한 법안들에도 반대 입장을 고수 중입니다.
[정경희/국민의힘 국회의원 : "특혜를 대물림하는 법안을 아무런 합의도 없이 날치기하다니 뻔뻔스럽기 짝이 없습니다. 민주유공자법을 빙자한 셀프 유공자법을 즉각 철회하십시오."]
여야가 팽팽히 맞서고 있는 가운데 오는 4일부터 18일까지 해외 순방이 예정된 김진표 국회의장의 선택에 관심이 쏠립니다.

Article: 파주 DMZ 평화의 길 테마노선, 14일부터 개방
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
'디엠지(DMZ) 평화의 길'은 비무장지대 접경지역의 생태·문화·역사 자원을 체험할 수 있도록 개발된 관광 노선입니다.
파주 노선은 지역의 역사와 특성을 가장 잘 드러낼 수 있는 볼거리를 토대로 '임진각-도라산 코스'라는 이름을 붙였습니다.
평일 오전과 주말에 이용할 수 있는 1코스는 임진각을 출발해 생태탐방로, 도라전망대, 도라산평화공원을 둘러보고, 올해 신설돼 평일 오후에 운영되는 2코스는 1코스에 남북출입사무소(출입경)와 도라산역이 추가됐습니다.
남북 출입사무소는 남북 간 인적, 물적 교류 업무를 총괄하던 곳이며 도라산역은 파주시 군내면 도라산리 민통선 안에 있는 경의선의 최북단 역입니다.
파주 노선을 이용하면 2002년 2월 김대중 대통령과 미국 부시 대통령이 도라산역을 방문했을 때 서명한 철도 침목과 다양한 예술 콘텐츠를 볼 수 있는 '미디어 월(Media Wall)'이 있습니다.
프로그램은 주 5일(월·목요일 휴무) 운영되며, 회당 20명까지 출입할 수 있습니다.

Article: ‘인천 I-패스’ 오늘부터…인천시민이면 사용 횟수 제한 없이 혜택
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
‘인천 I-패스’는 정부의 K-패스 혜택 범위인 대중교통 비용의 20%를 환급하되 K-패스의 월 60회 한도를 무제한으로 확대한 것이 특징입니다.
또한, 청년 적용 범위를 19세부터 39세까지 확대했으며 65세 이상 어르신들의 환급률도 20%에서 30%로 늘렸습니다.
인천 I-패스 사업의 혜택을 받으려면 먼저 K-패스 카드를 발급받은 뒤, K-패스 누리집에서 회원가입 절차를 마쳐야 합니다.
회원가입을 통해 인천시민으로 확인되면 인천 I-패스의 혜택이 자동으로 적용되는 방식입니다.
기존 알뜰교통카드 사용자의 경우 6월 30일까지 K-패스 홈페이지에서 회원 전환에 동의하면 사용하던 알뜰교통카드로 K-패스와 인천 I-패스의 혜택을 받을 수 있습니다.
한편, 인천 I-패스 시행 첫날인 오늘 유정복 인천광역시장은 인천도시철도 1호선 인천터미널역에서 K-패스 카드를 직접 사용해 보고 시민들에게 I-패스 혜택을 홍보했습니다.

Article: ‘돈세탁 등 혐의’ 바이낸스 창업자, 미국서 징역 4개월 실형
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
로이터통신은 현지 시각 어제 미국 시애틀에 있는 워싱턴 서부 연방법원의 리처드 존스 판사가 자금세탁 혐의를 받고 있는 자오창펑에게 징역 4개월을 선고했다고 보도했습니다.
존스 판사는 선고 직전 자오창펑이 미국 법률 준수보다 바이낸스의 성장과 수익에 우선순위를 뒀다고 지적했습니다. 또 자오창펑이 “자금과 재정 능력, 인력을 갖추고도 지켜야 하는 규정을 준수하지 않았다”라고 선고 이유를 설명했습니다.
징역 4개월의 형량은 앞서 지난 23일 미 검찰이 구형한 징역 3년보다 훨씬 줄어든 것입니다. 미국 연방 권고 가이드라인에 따른 징역 1년 6개월에도 미치지 못하는 수준입니다.
존스 판사는 검찰이 자오창펑이 불법 행위를 미리 알았는지를 입증하지 못했기 때문에 징역 3년 형은 부적절하다고 판단했습니다.
자오창펑이 받은 형량은 고객 자금 수십억 달러를 빼돌린 혐의로 기소돼 1심에서 유죄 판결을 받은 가상화폐 거래소 FTX 창업자 샘 뱅크먼-프리드가 25년 형을 선고받은 것과 비교하면 매우 가벼운 것으로 평가됩니다.
그러나 검찰은 이번 판결 결과를 환영했습니다.
테사 고먼 연방 검사는 재판 직후 기자들에게 “오늘은 기념비적인 날”이라며 “이 사건에서 실형 판결이 나는 것이 중요했고, 우리는 결과에 만족한다”고 말했습니다.
자오창펑은 선고가 내려지기 전 판사에게 “죄송하다”며 “나는 적절한 자금 세탁 방지 프로그램을 시행하지 못했다. 이제 그 실수의 심각성을 깨달았다”고 말했습니다.
자오창펑의 변호인단은 집행유예를 선고해달라고 요청했으나 받아들여지지 않았습니다.
자오창펑은 돈세탁과 금융제재 위반, 사기 등의 혐의로 2020년께부터 미 당국의 조사를 받아오다 지난해 11월 기소됐습니다.

Article: 시흥 고가차로 공사장 교각 붕괴 내일 합동감식…수사전담팀 구성
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
시흥경찰서는 수사전탐팀을 꾸리고, 내일(2일) 오전 10시 30분쯤부터 국과수와 고용노동부, 산업안전보건공단과 함께 사고 현장에 대한 합동감식을 진행할 예정이라고 밝혔습니다.
경찰 관계자는 "합동 감식과 관련자 등 조사를 통해 사고 원인을 규명하겠다"고 밝혔습니다.
앞서 어제 오후 4시 반쯤 시흥시 월곶동 고가차로 공사 현장에서 교각 구조물이 추락하는 사고가 났습니다.
이 사고로 작업자 6명과 시민 1명 등 모두 7명이 다쳤습니다. 부상자 중 50대 작업자 1명은 교량에서 추락해 중상을 입었습니다.
공사 도중 크레인이 길이 54m짜리 다리 구조물을 옮기다 놓쳤고, 구조물이 아래로 떨어지면서 다른 구조물이 연쇄적으로 무너진 것으로 조사됐습니다.
사고로 인해 한 때 시흥시 서해안로 방산교차로에서 월곶교차로 구간, 월곶 방향 도로가 통제됐지만, 현재는 통행이 가능합니다.

Article: ‘플라스틱 협약’ 성과 없이 4차 회의 종료…부산 총회만 남아
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
환경부는 지난달 23일부터 30일까지 캐나다 오타와에서 열린 ‘유엔 플라스틱 오염 대응 협약’을 위한 ‘제4차 정부간협상위원회(INC-4)’가 어제 새벽(현지시간) 종료됐다고 밝혔습니다.
이번 4차 회의에서는 유엔환경계획(UNEP)이 준비한 협약 초안을 바탕으로 플라스틱 규제 대상과 방식, 이행수단 등 세부항목을 논의했지만 합의는 이뤄지지 못했고, 쟁점 사항에 대한 참가국들의 입장을 재확인하는 수준에서 논의가 마무리됐다고 환경부는 설명했습니다.
특히 이번 회의에서는 1차 플라스틱인 폴리머 생산을 억제하는 방안과 관련해 유럽연합 등 선진국 그룹과 사우디아라비아, 이란, 러시아 등 산유국 그룹의 의견이 크게 엇갈린 것으로 전해졌습니다.
합의문 도출에 실패한 참가국들은 오는 11월 부산에서 열리는 5차 회의 전까지 전문가 그룹논의를 통해 쟁점 사안을 조율하는 ‘회기 간 작업’을 진행하기로 했습니다.
이번 정부 간 협상에는 환경부와 외교부, 산업통상자원부, 해양수산부 등 우리 정부대표단을 비롯해 전 세계 170여 개국 정부 대표단과 환경단체, 플라스틱 업계 관계자 등 약 3,000명이 참석했습니다.
환경단체 그린피스는 회의 종료 직후 성명을 내고 “이번 회의는 협약 마련을 위한 5번의 회의 가운데 네 번째 회의임에도 불구하고 더 복잡해진 문서만 남긴 채 종료됐다”면서 “유의미한 진전이 없었다”고 평가했습니다.
그린피스는 또, “석유 화학 업계가 협상 회의에 196명의 로비스트를 보내는 등 협약 실효성을 약화시키기 위한 로비활동을 펼쳤다”고 비판했습니다.
4차 회의에 옵서버로 참여한 김나라 그린피스 플라스틱 활동가는 “이제 전 세계의 시선이 마지막 회의 개최국인 한국으로 향한다”면서 “한국 정부는 본 협약이 본래의 목적 안에서 강력한 협약이 성안 될 수 있도록 역할을 다해야 할 것”이라고 촉구했습니다.

Article: 주택가서 경찰과 총격전…경찰 등 4명 사망
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
미국 노스캐롤라이나의 한 주택가에서 영장을 집행하던 경찰과 용의자 간에 총격전이 벌어졌습니다.
3시간 가까이 이어진 대치 상황 끝에 경찰 등 4명이 숨졌습니다.
조혜진 기자가 보도합니다.
[리포트]
주택가에 경찰 장갑차가 들어섭니다.
무장한 경찰들도 곳곳에 배치됐습니다.
곧이어 구급차들도 줄지어 도착했습니다.
현지 시각 지난달 29일 낮, 미국 노스캐롤라이나에서 경찰과 범죄 용의자 간 총격전이 벌어졌습니다.
[리사 레인/목격자 : "처음에는 30초 정도 세 번의 총성이 있었고, 그 다음에는 7번, 그 다음에는 10번의 총성이 있었습니다."]
경찰 등 8명이 병원으로 옮겨졌습니다.
그중 3명이 사망했고, 밤사이 치료를 받던 경찰 1명이 숨져 사망자는 4명으로 늘었습니다.
당시 경찰은 불법 무기 소지 등의 혐의로 영장을 집행하던 중이었습니다.
그런데 한 용의자가 2층에서 경찰을 향해 총을 쏘기 시작했다고 현지 언론들은 보도했습니다.
이후 이 용의자가 총을 들고 집 밖으로 나와 '임박한 치명적 위협'이라고 판단해 사살했다고 경찰은 밝혔습니다.
[케빈 피에트러스/현지 경찰 : "남성 용의자는 총기를 들고 집 밖으로 나갔고, 집 앞마당에서 총에 맞았습니다."]
3시간가량 이어진 대치 끝에 또 다른 용의자 2명은 결국 체포됐습니다.
최근 들어 경찰을 향한 총격 사건 중 가장 피해가 크다는 보도가 나오는 가운데, 지난해 미국에서 근무 중 총격으로 숨지거나 다친 경찰은 모두 378명 역대 최다였습니다.

Article: 컬럼비아 시위 학생, 건물 점거…학교 측 “출입 제한”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
미국 친 팔레스타인 시위의 진원지인 뉴욕 컬럼비아 대학의 상황이 점차 격화되고 있습니다.
학생들이 현지 시각으로 밤 사이 학교 건물을 점거한 가운데, 학교 측은 사실상 캠퍼스를 봉쇄했습니다.
뉴욕에서 박일중 특파원입니다.
[리포트]
친 팔레스타인 시위 학생들이 구호를 외치며 컬럼비아 대학교 주요 건물인 해밀턴홀 앞을 에워싸고 있습니다.
일부 학생들이 막아서지만 곧 시위대가 차단 울타리를 뛰어넘습니다.
그리고 학교 문 유리창을 깨고 안으로 진입합니다.
창 밖으로 해밀턴홀을 '힌드홀'로 지칭하는 깃발이 내걸리자 시위 학생들이 환호합니다.
힌드는 이스라엘군에 의해 숨진 팔레스타인 5살 어린이의 이름입니다.
학교 출입 통제도 강화됐습니다.
전날까지만 해도 학생과 교직원이 다니던 출입문이 굳게 잠겼습니다.
출입문은 한 곳만 개방했고, 교내 기숙사에 사는 학생이나 필수 인력만 안으로 들어갈 수 있습니다.
학교 측은 전날 오후 2시 학생들에 통보한 텐트 철거 시한이 지나자 정학 처분을 내리기 시작했습니다.
이에 학생들은 해산을 거부하고 맞서다 새벽 2시 건물을 점거한 겁니다.
학교 측은 건물을 점거하고 있는 학생들을 퇴학시킬 것이라고 경고하고 있습니다.
하지만 학생들은 100명 이상이 함께하고 있다며, 요구가 관철될 때까지 물러나지 않겠다는 입장입니다.
현지 시각으로 지난달 18일 컬럼비아 대학에서 경찰이 학생 100여 명을 체포한 이후 미국 내 20여 개 대학에서 모두 천 명 안팎의 학생이 체포된 것으로 집계되고 있습니다.

대구 강북경찰서는 오늘(1일) 새벽 2시쯤 북구의 한 아파트 내 주차장에서 30대 여성이 승용차에 깔려 숨졌다고 밝혔습니다.
사고 당시 인근 차량의 블랙박스를 확인한 결과 여성 위쪽으로 한 승용차가 지나갔고, 승용차는 현장을 빠져나갔다고 설명했습니다.
경찰은 피해 여성이 왜 주차장에 누워있었는지는 확인하고 있다면서, 사고를 낸 차량을 추적하고 있다고 밝혔습니다.

Article: 김현종 전 통상본부장, 트럼프 측근 통상정책 ‘키맨’ 라이트하이저 만나
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
라이트하이저는 트럼프 행정부에서 미국의 대(對)중국 관세를 설계한 인물로 지금도 트럼프 전 대통령의 무역·경제 정책에 상당한 영향력을 행사하고 있으며, 트럼프 재선 성공 시 트럼프 2기에서 재무부 장관 등 중책을 맡을 가능성이 거론됩니다.
김현종 전 본부장은 현지 시각 어제 소셜미디어 엑스(X·옛 트위터)를 통해 “오늘 팜비치(미국 플로리다주)에서 라이트하이저 전 USTR 대표를 만났다. 중국 등에 관세 부과, 반도체장비 수출통제, 멕시코산 전기차 등 트럼프 대통령 당선 시 미국 통상 정책에 대해 논의했다”고 밝혔습니다.
그는 “(라이트하이저는) ‘76세인데 디테일을 어떻게 아느냐’ 질문에 ‘매일 공부한다’고 한다. 역시 글래디에이터는 매일 칼을 갈고 있었다”고 말했습니다.
김 전 본부장은 문재인 정부 시절인 2017∼2019년 산업통상자원부 통상교섭본부장을 지내며 라이트하이저와 인연을 맺었습니다.
당시 트럼프 행정부는 한국의 대미 무역흑자를 문제 삼아 한미 자유무역협정(FTA) 개정을 요구했으며, 국가 안보를 이유로 전 세계에서 수입하는 철강에 관세를 부과하는 등 한국을 강하게 압박했습니다.
김 전 본부장은 통상 수장으로서 미국과 협상을 총괄했고, 라이트하이저가 그의 상대였습니다. 당시 협상은 치열하게 했지만, 그 과정에서 친분을 쌓아 지금까지도 관계를 유지해온 것으로 전해졌습니다.

Article: 문체부, 공정위와 손잡고 ‘웹소설 표준계약서’ 만든다
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
문화체육관광부와 공정거래위원회는 창작사와 제작사, 플랫폼사 등과 함께 웹소설 생태계 상생환경 조성을 위한 협약을 맺었다고 오늘(1일) 밝혔습니다.
이번 상생협약에는 불법유통 근절과 표준식별체계 개발 등 업계 주요 현안과 창작자 권리 보호를 위한 매출 정보 제공, 휴재권·계약종료권 보장 등의 합의 사항이 담겼습니다.
앞서 웹소설 산업 관련 협회·단체가 모여 지난해 9월 출범한 웹소설상생협의체는 그동안 12차례에 걸쳐 웹소설 창작자와 업계의 의견 등을 수렴해왔습니다.
문체부는 상생협의체의 논의를 반영해 출판권 설정계약서, 전자출판 배타적 발행권 설정계약서, 연재 계약서 등 웹소설 분야 표준계약서 3종을 마련해 올해 고시할 예정입니다.

Article: 의대 증원 1,500명대 중반 전망…“국립대 중심 증원분 감축”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
이런 가운데 2025학년도 의대 증원 규모는 1,500명대 중반으로 잠정 집계됐습니다.
정부 원안 2천 명 보다 400여 명 줄어든 건데, 의료 공백 사태의 물꼬를 트겠다며 정원 조정안을 제시했던 국립대들이 증원 폭을 정부안의 50% 수준으로 결정했습니다.
이 소식은 김민혁 기자입니다.
[리포트]
현재 142명을 선발하는 전북대학교 의과대학.
2025학년도에는 정부 증원 안의 절반인 29명을 늘려 171명을 뽑기로 했습니다.
경북대 의대 역시 정부 증원 안의 절반인 45명만 늘리기로 하면서, 의대 정원을 155명으로 결정했습니다.
지역 거점 국립대 9곳 중 정원을 이번 달 결정하기로 한 전남대를 제외한 8곳은 교육부 증원분의 50% 수준에서 내년도 증원 안을 제출했습니다.
[임상규/경북대학교 교무처장 : "(자율 결정이) 50%에서 100% 사이라고 이 범위는 정해져 있지마는 저희들이 제안한 취지는 좀 줄이자는 취지였으니까, (2025학년도는) 그래서 우리는 50%만 하겠다…."]
반면, 대부분의 사립대는 기존 증원 규모를 유지했습니다.
국립대보다 증원 규모가 작고, 의대 규모가 대학 평판에 미치는 영향도 무시할 수 없기 때문으로 분석됩니다.
[지역 사립대 관계자/음성변조 : "50% 했다가 내년에 또 어떻게 될지 모르니까 일단 정원 받은 만큼 다 하는…."]
다만 이른바 '빅5'병원을 수련병원으로 둔, 울산대와 성균관대는 기존 증원분보다 10명 줄어든 70명씩을 증원하기로 했습니다.
아직 증원 폭을 확정 짓지 못한 일부 대학이 기존 안을 유지할 경우 2025학년도 의대 증원분은 1,500명대 중반이 될 전망입니다.
당초 2천 명 증원 계획보다 400여 명 줄어든 것입니다.
각 대학은 대학교육협의회 심의를 거쳐 이번 달 말까지 신입생 모집요강에 증원분을 반영할 계획입니다.
한편 제주대 등 국립대 의대생 400여 명이 총장 등을 상대로 증원 절차를 멈춰달라며 낸 가처분 신청은 법원에서 기각됐습니다.

정희용 수석대변인은 오늘 논평을 통해 “지금의 대한민국을 있게 한 근간이자, 나라 경제를 이끌며 현장 일선에서 땀 흘리는 모든 노동자 여러분의 노고와 헌신에 감사드린다”며 “우리 당은 노동자들이 흘린 땀과 노력이 헛되지 않도록 노동의 가치가 제대로 존중받는 사회를 만들기 위해 노력하겠다”고 했습니다.
정 수석대변인은 “윤석열 정부는 정권 초기부터 ‘3대 개혁’에 ‘노동’을 포함시켜 최우선 국정과제로 삼아 진정한 땀의 가치를 존중하고 이를 위한 정책 마련에 힘을 쏟아 왔다”고 강조했습니다.
그러면서 “지난해 10월 ‘노조 회계 공시제도’를 도입하며 그간 거대 노조의 강성 파업·회계 비공개·고용 세습·노노(勞勞) 간 착취 등 비상식적 특권과 불법행위가 만연했던 상황에서 벗어나 발전적 노사관계로의 새로운 장을 열기 위해 끊임없이 노력했다”고 밝혔습니다.
정 수석대변인은 “땀의 가치가 인정받는 사회를 만들기 위해서는 특정 세력들에게만 이익이 독점되어서는 안될 것”이라며 “비노조·저임금 노동자 등 노동 약자들을 보호하는 것뿐만 아니라 실질적으로 국민께서 체감할 수 있는 노동 정책을 마련하는 데에 총력을 다하겠다”고 했습니다.

Article: 법원 “의대 증원 5월 중순까지 승인 말아달라…요청일 뿐 구속력 없어”
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
서울고법 행정7부(부장판사 구회근)는 어제(30일) 전공의·수험생 등 18명이 복지부와 교육부를 상대로 의대 정원 증원 처분 취소소송의 집행정지 항고심 심문기일을 열었습니다.
이날 양 측은 첫 집행정지 심문과 유사한 취지의 주장을 내놓고 공방을 벌였습니다.
의대생들은 "정원 증원으로 교육의 질이 하락할 것"이라고 말한 반면, 정부 측은 "정책의 당사자는 대학총장이므로 의대생들은 소송 자격이 없다"고 맞섰습니다.
이에 재판부는 "(의대) 정원이 늘어날 경우 대학 총장이 (법적으로) 다툼을 할 가능성이 없어 보인다"라며 "그렇다면 국가가 의대 정원을 증원할 때 다툴 수 있는 사람이 아무도 없다는 것인가"라고 물었습니다.
그러면서 "그렇다면 국가의 결정은 사법적으로 심사, 통제할 수 없다는 것인지 조금 의문이 든다"며 "모든 행정 행위는 사법 통제를 받아야 한다. 정부에서 한다고 일사천리로 해야 한다고는 볼 수 없다"라고 지적했습니다.
재판부는 정부 측 대리인에 증원 처분과 관련된 추가 자료와 근거들을 제출하라고 요청했습니다.
또 집행정지 항고심에 대한 결론은 다음 달 중순께 내겠다는 의사를 내비치면서 "그 전에는 (증원에 대한) 최종 승인이 나지 말아야 할 것"이라고 언급했습니다.
이에 대해 서울고법 측은 "집행정지 사건의 결정 전에 서둘러 절차가 진행되어 확정되면 해당 사건의 실익이 없어지기 때문에 기다려 달라고 요청한 것"이라며, "재판부에서 언급한 부분에 어떤 구속력이 있는 것은 결정이나 명령은 아니다"라고 밝혔습니다.
정부는 지난 2월 6일 2025학년도부터 5년 간 매년 2천 명씩, 총 1만 명을 의대생을 증원한다는 의대 증원 계획을 발표했습니다. 3월 20일에는 대학별로 의대 입학정원 수요 신청을 받아 배정 결과를 발표했습니다.
이에 전국 의대생 1만3천 명 등은 복지부와 교육부를 상대로 2천 명 증원 처분에 대한 취소를 구하는 집단소송 및 집행정지를 서울행정법원에 신청했습니다. 하지만 법원은 소송 자격인 당사자적격을 인정할 수 없다며 대부분 각하 결정을 내렸습니다.

이에 재판부는 "(의대) 정원이 늘어날 경우 대학 총장이 (법적으로) 다툼을 할 가능성이 없어 보인다"라며 "그렇다면 국가가 의대 정원을 증원할 때 다툴 수 있는 사람이 아무도 없다는 것인가"라고 물었습니다.
그러면서 "그렇다면 국가의 결정은 사법적으로 심사, 통제할 수 없다는 것인지 조금 의문이 든다"며 "모든 행정 행위는 사법 통제를 받아야 한다. 정부에서 한다고 일사천리로 해야 한다고는 볼 수 없다"라고 지적했습니다.
재판부는 정부 측 대리인에 증원 처분과 관련된 추가 자료와 근거들을 제출하라고 요청했습니다.
또 집행정지 항고심에 대한 결론은 다음 달 중순께 내겠다는 의사를 내비치면서 "그 전에는 (증원에 대한) 최종 승인이 나지 말아야 할 것"이라고 언급했습니다.
이에 대해 서울고법 측은 "집행정지 사건의 결정 전에 서둘러 절차가 진행되어 확정되면 해당 사건의 실익이 없어지기 때문에 기다려 달라고 요청한 것"이라며, "재판부에서 언급한 부분에 어떤 구속력이 있는 것은 결정이나 명령은 아니다"라고 밝혔습니다.
정부는 지난 2월 6일 2025학년도부터 5년 간 매년 2천 명씩, 총 1만 명을 의대생을 증원한다는 의대 증원 계획을 발표했습니다. 3월 20일에는 대학별로 의대 입학정원 수요 신청을 받아 배정 결과를 발표했습니다.
이에 전국 의대생 1만3천 명 등은 복지부와 교육부를 상대로 2천 명 증원 처분에 대한 취소를 구하는 집단소송 및 집행정지를 서울행정법원에 신청했습니다. 하지만 법원은 소송 자격인 당사자적격을 인정할 수 없다며 대부분 각하 결정을 내렸습니다.

Article: 제시 마쉬, 브루노 라즈 외국인 사령탑 압축…5월 중순 발표

축구대표팀 차기 사령탑 후보로 잉글랜드 프리미어리그 지도자 출신 제시 마쉬와 포르투갈의 브루노 라즈 등 외국인 감독들이 유력 후보로 부상하고 있습니다.
대한축구협회는 협상이 마무리 수순에 접어들었다면서, 늦어도 5월 중순까지는 새 감독을 발표할 계획입니다.
김기범 기자가 보도합니다.
[리포트]
지난주 올림픽 대표팀의 본선 진출 좌절로 가장 유력한 후보였던 황선홍 감독 카드가 사실상 사라졌습니다.
[황선홍/23세 이하 축구대표팀 감독 : "많이 지쳐 있습니다. 조금 쉬고 싶어요."]
전력강화위원회가 압축한 4명의 국내 사령탑 후보는 올림픽 실패와 K리그 소속팀 사정 등으로 선임이 어렵게 됐습니다.
이렇게 되면서 축구협회의 선택은 외국인 감독 쪽으로 기울어졌습니다.
전력강화위원회는 비공개 회의를 열었는데, 최대 4명의 감독 후보군이 압축된 걸로 알려졌습니다.
이 가운데는 황희찬의 잘츠부르크 시절 스승인 제시 마쉬 전 리즈 유나이티드 감독과, 역시 황희찬을 울버햄프턴으로 2022년 임대 영입한 포르투갈의 브루노 라즈 감독이 이름을 올렸습니다.
정해성 전력강화 위원장이 유럽으로 직접 건너가 이들과 1차 면접을 진행했습니다.
[정해성/전력강화위원장 : "한국적인 문화에 같이 공감대를 가지고 갈 수 있는 부분이 가장 중요하다고 생각합니다."]
축구협회 고위 관계자는 클린스만 감독의 계약 해지 위약금 규모와 상관없이, 외국인 사령탑 후보와 협상할 계획이라고 밝혔습니다.
축구협회는 압축된 감독 후보군을 바탕으로 늦어도 5월 중순까지 새 감독을 선임할 계획입니다.

읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
지금 이 시각 여수 모습을 보시면 비는 대부분 그쳤는데요.
하지만 전라도 지역은 대기가 불안정해 지면서 밤까지 5에서 10밀리미터 안팎의 소나기가 오는 곳도 있겠습니다.
토요일까지는 대체로 맑겠지만, 어린이날인 일요일 오후부터 전국에 비가 내리기 시작해 대체 공휴일인 다음 주 월요일에도 비가 이어지겠습니다.
내일부터는 기온이 다시 오름세를 보이겠습니다.
내일은 서울의 낮 기온이 초여름의 기준인 25도까지 오르겠고, 모레 금요일에는 28도, 토요일에는 29도 등 30도 가까이 올라가 덥겠습니다.
다만 내일과 모레는 내륙 지역의 아침 기온이 10도 아래로 떨어지면서 쌀쌀해 기온의 일교차가 15도에서 20도 이상 매우 크게 벌어지겠습니다.
오늘은 전국에 가끔 구름이 많이 끼겠습니다.
전남 해안과 경남 해안에는 바람이 강하게 불겠습니다.
낮 기온은 서울이 24도, 춘천과 원주, 청주 23, 전주와 광주, 대구 20도로 중부지방은 어제보다 조금 높겠고, 남부지방은 어제보다 1도에서 5도 정도 낮겠습니다.
바다의 물결은 제주 남쪽 먼바다에서 최고 4미터로 높게 일겠습니다.
경상도 해안과 제주도 해안에는 높은 너울이 밀려오는 곳이 있겠습니다.

Article: ‘소녀상 전시반대’ 일본 시장 “조국 위한 죽음은 도덕적” 발언 논란
읽어주기 기능은 크롬기반의
브라우저에서만 사용하실 수 있습니다.
가와무라 다카시 나고야 시장은 지난달 22일 기자회견에서 고등학생을 대상으로 제정한 ‘나고야 평화의 날’ 의의에 관한 질문에 전쟁이 지속되고 있는 우크라이나와 팔레스타인 사례를 소개하면서 전쟁이 시작되는 요인을 생각할 필요가 있다고 언급했습니다.
이어 태평양전쟁 전사자를 포함해 “조국을 위해 목숨을 버린다는 것은 상당히 높은 수준의 도덕적 행위”라고 주장했습니다.
그러면서 학교 교육 현장에서도 “어느 정도는 생각하지 않으면 안 된다”고 덧붙였습니다.
이에 시민단체는 “국민 희생을 미화했다”고 항의했고, 나고야 시의회 자민당 의원단도 기자회견을 열어 “전쟁 기반은 살육으로, 그 행위를 도덕적이라고 하는 것은 부적절하다”고 지적했습니다.
하지만 가와무라 시장은 전날 기자회견에서 논란이 된 말에 문제가 없다는 인식을 드러내면서 발언을 고수했다고 아사히는 전했습니다.
그는 “(세계는) 안타깝지만 제2차 세계대전을 일으켜 매우 많은 사람을 죽였다”면서 “조국이 잘못된 경우도 있지만 이해되지 않는 역사 속에서 목숨을 잃은 사람들의 죽음은 완전히 무의미한 것인가”라고 반문했습니다.
이어 이들 덕분에 지금의 평화가 있다면서 “조국을 위해 죽는 것은 하나의 도덕적 행위”라고 거듭 강조했습니다.
이에 대해 근현대사 연구자인 쓰지타 마사노리는 아사히에 “전쟁에서 죽는 것을 ‘도덕적’이라고 한다면 그것이 권장해야 할 좋은 행위가 된다”고 비판했습니다.
가와무라 시장은 2019년 아이치 트리엔날레에서 위안부 피해자를 상징하는 ‘평화의 소녀상’이 전시되자 위안부 문제가 “사실이 아니었을 가능성이 있다”고 말하며 전시를 반대한 우익 성향 정치인입니다.

Article: 개그맨 이진호가 여자친구의 바람을 2번이나 겪어 5년간 연애를 하고 있지 않다고 밝혔다.
지난달 30일 방송된 SBS '신발 벗고 돌싱포맨'(이하 '돌싱포맨')에서는 이진호가 여자친구의 바람으로 생긴 트라우마를 이야기했다. 이진호는 미혼이기 때문에 결혼의 행복도, 이혼의 아픔도 모르는 상태였다. 이진호는 "나는 여기서 아무것도 부럽지 않다"고 말해 눈길을 끌었다. 탁재훈은 "우리가 부럽냐 물어본 건 아니지 않느냐. 우리도 널 부러워할 것 같으냐"면서 웃음을 유발했다.
이상민은 이진호를 향해 "5년 동안 연애도 못 한 주제에"라고 '돌싱' 부심을 부렸다. 이진호는 "난 지금이라도 나가면 연애 바로 가능하다"고 자신감을 보였다. 임원희는 믿기지 않은 듯 "바로 연애할 수 있다고?"라고 되물었고, 이진호는 "그렇다. 오늘 안에 연애할 수 있다"고 답했다.
김준호는 "이진호도 탁재훈 쪽이라고" 하면서 입담이 좋다는 듯 제스처랬다. 탁재훈은 "'내 쪽'이 무슨 말이야?"라고 물었고 김준호는 "잠깐 인기 있는 거다"라고 말해 폭소케 했다. 이진호는 "잠깐 좋아하는 게 아니다". 재치 있는 우리를 계속 보고 싶어 한다며 반박 의견을 내세웠다. 이상민은 "보고만 싶지, 갖고 싶진 않다"라고 돌직구를 날렸다. 연애 때문에 이진호는 눈물을 꽤 흘렸었다고. 이어 이상민은 "여자친구의 바람을 2번이나 겪은 게 맞냐고" 물었다. 이진호는 그렇다면서 "5년간 연애를 안 한 게 그때 트라우마가 있다. 나를 만나는 동시에 다른 사람을 만났으니까. 한 번이 아니라 두 번 겪었다"라고 토로했다. 듣고 있던 탁재훈은 "그러면서까지 왜 만나려고 그래?"라고 물었다.
이상민은 "그래서 연애를 못 하고 있는 거다"라고 대신 답했다. 여자친구의 바람은 어떻게 알았느냐는 물음에 "여자친구가 잠들었는 데 전화가 왔다. 발신 번호가 여자친구랑 뒷번호가 똑같더라. 저장은 안 돼 있었다. 내가 전화를 받고 아무 말 안 했는데 전화기 너머로 '어디야?'라는 낯선 남자의 음성이 들렸다. 그냥 끊었다"고 말했다. 이어 여자친구가 깰 때까지 기다렸다고 말했다.
여자친구가 깬 후 "뒷번호 같은 전화번호 누구냐고 물었더니 여자친구가 횡설수설하더니 결국 '아버지'라고 답을 했다. 목소리가 확실하게 아버지가 아니었다. 심지어 난 여자친구 아버지의 전화번호를 알고 있었다. 아버지 번호 안다고 얘기하니 여자친구가 얼버무리다가 가버렸다. 그 뒤로 연락 두절됐다"고 지난날의 상처를 털어놨다. 변명도 듣지 못하고 급작스럽게 이별을 맞이한 상황이었다. 그 후 입대 직전에 장문으로 '미안하다'는 메시지만 왔다고 말해 충격을 더했다.

지난달 30일 방송된 SBS '신발 벗고 돌싱포맨'(이하 '돌싱포맨')에서는 이진호가 여자친구의 바람으로 생긴 트라우마를 이야기했다. 이진호는 미혼이기 때문에 결혼의 행복도, 이혼의 아픔도 모르는 상태였다. 이진호는 "나는 여기서 아무것도 부럽지 않다"고 말해 눈길을 끌었다. 탁재훈은 "우리가 부럽냐 물어본 건 아니지 않느냐. 우리도 널 부러워할 것 같으냐"면서 웃음을 유발했다.
이상민은 이진호를 향해 "5년 동안 연애도 못 한 주제에"라고 '돌싱' 부심을 부렸다. 이진호는 "난 지금이라도 나가면 연애 바로 가능하다"고 자신감을 보였다. 임원희는 믿기지 않은 듯 "바로 연애할 수 있다고?"라고 되물었고, 이진호는 "그렇다. 오늘 안에 연애할 수 있다"고 답했다.
김준호는 "이진호도 탁재훈 쪽이라고" 하면서 입담이 좋다는 듯 제스처랬다. 탁재훈은 "'내 쪽'이 무슨 말이야?"라고 물었고 김준호는 "잠깐 인기 있는 거다"라고 말해 폭소케 했다. 이진호는 "잠깐 좋아하는 게 아니다". 재치 있는 우리를 계속 보고 싶어 한다며 반박 의견을 내세웠다. 이상민은 "보고만 싶지, 갖고 싶진 않다"라고 돌직구를 날렸다. 연애 때문에 이진호는 눈물을 꽤 흘렸었다고. 이어 이상민은 "여자친구의 바람을 2번이나 겪은 게 맞냐고" 물었다. 이진호는 그렇다면서 "5년간 연애를 안 한 게 그때 트라우마가 있다. 나를 만나는 동시에 다른 사람을 만났으니까. 한 번이 아니라 두 번 겪었다"라고 토로했다. 듣고 있던 탁재훈은 "그러면서까지 왜 만나려고 그래?"라고 물었다.

Article: 가수 겸 MC 데프콘이 솔로녀드의 대박 스펙에 놀라움을 금치 못했다.
1일 밤 10시 30분 방송하는 SBS Plus와 ENA의 리얼 데이팅 프로그램 ‘나는 SOLO’에서는 ‘솔로나라 20번지’ 솔로녀들이 ‘자기소개 타임’으로 ‘초특급 엘리트’ 면모와 당찬 매력을 드러내는 모습이 펼쳐진다.
앞서 ‘솔로나라 20번지’ 입성부터 심상치 않은 스펙을 공개했던 20기 솔로녀들은 이날 ‘자기소개 타임’으로 입이 떡 벌어지는 역대급 정체를 낱낱이 밝힌다. 학력부터 직업까지, 까면 깔수록 더 놀라운 솔로녀들의 반전 실체가 안방을 초토화시킬 전망이다.
실제로, 솔로녀들의 ‘스펙 파티’에 3MC 데프콘-이이경-송해나는 벌어진 입을 다물 줄을 모른다. 송해나는 “대박이다”, “이번 기수 너무 멋지다”고 감탄하고, 데프콘은 “역대급 스펙이다. 너무 대단해서 좀 두렵다”라며 후덜덜 떤다. 심지어 한 솔로녀의 ‘자기소개’ 후, 데프콘은 “와씨!”를 외치고, 이이경은 “죄송하다. 전혀 몰랐다”며 급하게 사과에 나선다. 3MC의 ‘사과 사태’까지 불러일으킨 ‘반전녀’의 정체에 궁금증이 치솟는다.
그런가 하면 20기 솔로녀들은 ‘영원한 짝’을 찾고 싶은 열망을 어필한다. 한 솔로녀는 “6명 남자 중에 ‘너만 보여’, 이런 사람을 만나면 직진하고 싶다”는 ‘로맨스 각오’를 드러내고, 또 다른 솔로녀는 “이전에는 커리어에 포커스를 뒀는데 이제는 사랑에 포커스를 두고 싶다”고 이야기한다. ‘대박 커리어’만큼 ‘대박 로맨스’를 꿈꾸는 솔로녀들의 ‘자기소개 타임’에 초미의 관심이 쏠린다.

Article: 김고은이 <파묘>로 ‘파이오니어(PIONEER)상’을 수상했다.
지난 27일 용산CGV에서 열린 제11회 마리끌레르 영화제에 김고은이 참석해 ‘파이오니어상’을 수상하며 자리를 빛냈다. 마리끌레르 영화제는 패션 매거진 마리끌레르가 주최하는 시상식으로, 김고은은 자신만의 길을 개척하며 한국 영화 산업에 이바지한 배우에게 전하는 파이오니어상을 받은 뒤, 관객과의 대화를 이어갔다.
김고은은 “귀한 시간 내어 <파묘>보러 와주신 관객분들께 감사하다. 장재현 감독님께서 시상해주셔서 더욱 의미있는 것 같다. 마리끌레르에서 주신 뜻깊은 상 받아서 감사하다. 앞으로 더 좋은 배우가 되도록 노력하겠다”며 진심 어린 소감을 밝혔다.
지난 2월 22일 개봉해 1185만 관객을 동원하며 아직도 식지 않은 열기로 장기 상영을 이어가고 있는 <파묘>는 특히 김고은이 연기한 무당 ‘화림’ 역에 대한 호평이 쏟아지며 무속인 선생님과 꾸준히 교류하며 준비해온 김고은의 캐릭터 해석력과 단단한 내공을 갖춘 탄탄한 연기력이 관객들에게 짜릿함을 안겼다. 대살굿 장면에서 신들린 듯 칼춤을 추는 김고은의 모습은 스크린을 장악하기에 충분했다.
한편, 김고은은 마리끌레르 영화제에 이어 <파묘>로 제60회 백상예술대상 영화부문 여자 최우수연기상 후보에 올라 관심이 집중되고 있다. 김고은은 차기작 <대도시의 사랑법> 촬영을 마치고 <은중과 상연> 촬영에 매진하고 있다.

Article: ‘아빠는 꽃중년’의 안재욱이 새벽 6시 기상과 함께 완벽한 아침 식사 준비는 물론 빈틈없는 두 남매 케어로 ‘꽃대디’들의 감탄을 자아낸다.
5월 2일(목) 밤 9시 30분 방송하는 채널A ‘아빠는 꽃중년’ 3회에서는 9세(만 8세) 딸 수현이와 4세(만 3세) 아들 도현이 키우는 54세(만 52세) 아빠이자 배우 안재욱의 육아 일상이 처음으로 공개된다.
이날 안재욱의 일상 공개에 앞서 ‘꽃대디’들의 아지트에 모인 김용건, 김구라, 신성우, 김원준은 안재욱을 향해 “지난번에 우리 일상 보면서 자신만만해 하던데, 오늘 한번 지켜봐야겠다”라고 매의 눈을 가동해 ‘찐친 케미’를 발산한다. 직후 안재욱의 집과 네 식구의 가족사진이 공개되는데 이와 관련해 그는 “아내와 연애를 시작해서 결혼까지 6개월이 걸렸다. 확신이 굳어져서 시간을 지체할 필요가 없었던 것 같다”고 9세 연하인 아내 최현주(뮤지컬 배우)를 소개한다. 이어 “첫째 딸 수현이는 허니문 베이비다. 태명도 ‘한방이’였다”라고 밝힌 뒤 “둘째는 계획을 했는데 잘 안 생겨서 2년 반 노력하다가 포기했었다. 그런데 한 달 만에 생겼고, 그래서 도현이가 더욱 귀한 아이가 됐다”고 애틋한 부성애를 드러낸다.
잠시 후, 안재욱은 아침 6시에 기상해 주방으로 들어가더니, 청경채볶음과 전복버터구이를 능숙하게 요리한다. 이를 지켜보던 신성우는 “저렇게 (요리를) 잘 하면서 왜 우리 MT 갔을 때에는 안 했냐?”라고 뒤끝(?) 발언을 던진다. 김원준 역시 “요리를 너무 잘하시는데? 나도 요리 학원 끊어야 하나”라며 안재욱의 요리 실력을 극찬한다. 직후 아내 최현주가 등장하고, 최현주는 제작진과의 인터뷰에서 “우리 둘 다 애교가 많은 편이 아니다. 결혼 9년 차가 되다 보니 담백한 느낌?”이라고 해 모두를 폭소케 한다. 반면 안재욱은 ‘꽃대디’들에게 “제 주인님이십니다!”라고 김원준의 아내 애칭인 ‘주인님’을 소환하면서 ‘애정 뿜뿜’한 모습을 보인다.
그런가 하면 안재욱은 한식으로 차린 아침에 이어, 점심은 분식, 저녁은 중식으로 세끼 다른 밥상을 차려내 놀라움을 더한다. 하지만 50살 나이 차가 나는 4세 아들 도현이는 “맛 없어! 안 먹어! 외식 하자~”라며 안재욱을 잡아(?) ‘대환장 부자 케미’를 폭발시킨다.
수준급 셰프 면모로 ‘꽃대디’들을 놀라게 한 안재욱의 요리 실력과, 두 남매를 돌보느라 허리 펼 새가 없는 안재욱의 ‘지천명 육아’ 현장에 관심이 쏠리는 가운데, ‘쉰살, 지천명’에 육아의 명을 받고 온몸으로 구르는 아빠들의 육아 생존기를 담아내 시청률과 화제성을 폭발시키고 있는 채널A ‘아빠는 꽃중년’ 3회는 5월 2일(목) 밤 9시 30분 방송된다.

Article: 가수 펀치(Punch) 가 조영수 리메이크 프로젝트 세 번째 주자로 출격한다.
펀치가 가창에 참여한 조영수 리메이크 프로젝트 세 번째 음원 '그대만이'가 오는 8일 발매된다.
조영수가 작곡한 '그대만이'는 지난 2008년 김종욱이 발매한 곡으로, 가상 결혼 버라이어티 프로그램 MBC '우리 결혼했어요'에서 한 커플의 테마곡으로 대중의 사랑을 받았다. '그대만이'는 듣는 것만으로 가슴 설레는 감정을 전달할 예정이다.
특히 지난 4월 30일 넥스타엔터테인먼트 공식 SNS를 통해 '그대만이'의 라이브 클립 티저 영상이 공개되며 음악 팬들의 뜨거운 관심을 받고 있다. 영상 속 펀치는 블랙 앤 화이트 착장으로 등장해 깨끗한 음색으로 리스너들의 이목을 사로잡았고, 섬세한 가사와 어우러지는 표정 연기로 공개될 본편을 향한 기대감을 높였다.
그동안 호소력 짙은 목소리로 음악 팬들의 사랑을 받아온 펀치는 다수 인기 드라마 OST 가창에 참여해 시청자와 리스너를 동시에 사로잡으며 'OST 강자'로 자리매김했다. 이에 펀치와 조영수 작곡가의 만남이 어떤 시너지를 보이며 새로운 '그대만이'를 완성했을지 궁금증이 더해진다.
이번 리메이크 프로젝트는 가요계를 대표하는 히트곡 제조기 조영수의 명곡을 후배 아티스트들이 새롭게 재해석해 대중에게 선보이는 프로젝트다. 앞서 하이라이트 보컬 양요섭과 케이시가 가창에 참여해 각자의 개성을 살린 리메이크 음원으로 호평을 얻은 바 있다.
한편, 펀치의 목소리로 재탄생한 '그대만이'는 오는 8일 오후 6시 각종 온라인 음원사이트를 통해 발매된다.

Article: 그룹 82메이저가 글로벌 투어로 전 세계 팬들과 만난다.
82메이저(82MAJOR, 남성모·박석준·윤예찬·조성일·황성빈·김도균)는 지난달 30일 공식 SNS를 통해 글로벌 투어 커밍순 티저 이미지를 공개하며 해외 팬들과의 만남을 예고했다.
공지에 따르면 82메이저는 올해 하반기 아시아, 미주지역을 포함한 20여 개의 도시를 방문해 현지의 팬들과 만날 예정이다. 멤버들은 이번 투어에서 '촉(Choke)', 'FIRST CLASS(퍼스트 클래스)', 'Sure Thing(슈어 씽)' 등 팀의 대표곡들은 물론, 글로벌 관객들을 위한 맞춤형 스페셜 무대들도 준비 중이다.
데뷔 3개월 만에 단독 콘서트를 개최한 '공연형 아이돌' 82메이저인 만큼 이번 글로벌 투어에도 기대감이 높아지고 있다. 여섯 멤버는 신인답지 않은 탄탄한 라이브 및 퍼포먼스 실력, 여유 있는 무대매너로 관객들을 사로잡을 계획이며 모든 공연장을 자신들만의 폭발적인 에너지로 가득 채우겠다는 각오다.
특히 82메이저는 데뷔한 지 1년도 채 되지 않았음에도 단독 글로벌 투어를 성사시키는 쾌거를 이뤘다. 데뷔 후 눈에 띄는 스타성과 출중한 음악적 역량을 뽐내며 세계적인 K팝 그룹으로 성장할 포텐셜을 입증해 나가고 있는 멤버들은 이번 투어를 통해 전 세계의 음악 팬들에게 강렬한 인상을 남길 것으로 예상된다.
82메이저는 대한민국의 국가번호 '82'와 우리나라를 대표하는 '메이저'가 되겠다는 포부를 갖고 지난해 10월 데뷔한 신인 그룹으로, 팀명은 '에이티투메이저'로 읽는다. 지난달 29일에는 첫 번째 미니앨범 'BEAT by 82(비트 바이 에이티투)'를 발매했고, 타이틀곡 '촉'을 비롯해 멤버들의 음악적 정체성을 담아낸 전 수록곡이 국내외 리스너들로부터 좋은 반응을 얻고 있다.

Article: 40년 만에 올림픽 본선 진출 실패라는 '참사'가 벌어졌지만 한국 축구의 수장인 정몽규 대한축구협회장은 온데간데없었다.
한국 축구는 지난달 26일 카타르 도하에서 치른 인도네시아와의 '2024 아시아축구연맹(AFC) 23세 이하(U-23) 아시안컵' 8강전에서 2-2 무승부 이후 승부차기 끝에 10-11로 패배했다.
이번 대회는 오는 7월 열리는 2024 파리 올림픽 최종예선을 겸해 개최됐다.
아시아 국가에 배정된 축구 종목 출전권은 3.5장으로, 최소 3위 이상을 기록해야 파리로 직행할 수 있었다.
4위가 돼도 아프리카 지역 4위를 기록한 기니와의 플레이오프(PO)를 거쳐 올림픽에 출전할 수 있는 상황이었다.
그러나 한국은 8강에서 탈락하며 PO 희망까지 잃었다.
이로써 한국은 1988 서울 대회부터 2020 도쿄 대회까지 9회 연속으로 이어온 올림픽 본선 진출 기록에 마침표를 찍었다.
지난 2016 리우데자네이루 대회를 통해 8회 연속 올림픽 본선에 오르며 세계 신기록을 달성한 한국은 이번 파리행까지 확정하며 연속 진출 기록을 10회로 늘리겠다는 목표를 삼았으나, 실패했다.
한국 남자 축구가 올림픽에 가지 못한 건 1984 로스앤젤레스 대회 이후 무려 40년 만이다.
40년 공든 탑이 무너졌지만 한국 축구의 수장인 정몽규 회장은 자취를 감췄다.
팀을 이끌었던 황선홍 감독은 지난 달 귀국 기자회견에서 "모든 분들, 그리고 우리 선수들에게 죄송하고 미안하게 생각한다. 책임은 전적으로 감독인 저에게 있다고 생각한다. 책임을 통감한다"고 고개를 숙였다.
황 감독에게 3월 A대표팀 '투잡'을 맡기면서 올림픽 대표팀에 온전히 집중할 상황을 보장하지 않은 정해성 전력강화위원장도 축구 팬들로부터 많은 질타를 받았다.
탈락 이후 별도의 입장을 밝히진 않았지만, 정 위원장은 황 감독의 '투잡' 선임 당시 "모든 것에 대해 결과가 부정적으로 나왔을 때 어떻게 할 건지는 전력강화위원장으로서 책임지겠다"고 말한 바 있다. 이제 그 책임을 져야 할 때가 왔다.
그나마 위원장 한 명이 다시 해낼 수 없는 40년의 대기록이 무너진 데다, 말치레일 수 있는 발언일지라도 '책임'이란 단어를 선택하며 뒤로 숨지 않았다.
반면 가장 먼저 나서서 사과했어야 할 정 회장의 모습은 어디에서도 찾을 수 없었다.
위안이라면 축구협회가 홈페이지에 "파리 올림픽 본선 진출이 좌절된 것에 대해 축구팬, 축구인을 비롯한 국민 여러분께 깊은 사과의 말씀을 드린다"는 짧은 입장문을 발표한 것이다.
축구협회에 따르면 다음 공식 미디어 활동은 위르겐 클린스만(독일) 전 감독 후임 선임 발표가 될 예정이다.
언론을 통해 왜 U-23 아시안컵에서 조기 탈락했는지, 다시 연령별 대표가 동력을 얻을 수 있게 어떤 계획을 갖고 있는지에 대한 계획 공개나 브리핑은 당분간 없다는 의미다.
즉 지금까지 축구협회가 보인 행보대로 이번 참사에 대한 사과나 재발방지와 같은 내용을 언론에 거론하는 일은 없다는 뜻이다.
하지만 실망한 축구 팬들을 위해서라도 어떤 계획이 있는지 공개했어야 했다.
축구협회의 짧은 입장문을 끝으로, 어떤 언급도 없이 침묵하며 무책임한 자세로 일관해서는 축구 팬들의 반발을 잠재울 수는 없기 때문이다.
A대표팀 감독 선임 관련 이슈로 시선을 돌리는 것만이 능사가 아니다. 정 회장을 비롯한 축구협회 수뇌부들은 지나간 일을 되돌아보지 않으면 앞으로 나아갈 수 없다는 걸 명심해야 할 때다.

Article: 치명적인 동점골 허용이었다.
김민재가 활약하고 있는 독일 프로축구 바이에른 뮌헨은 1일 독일 뮌헨의 알리안츠 아레나에서 열린 유럽축구연맹(UEFA) 챔피언스리그(UCL) 준결승 1차전에서 2-2 무승부를 거뒀다.
에릭 다이어, 마테이스 더 리흐트 등 센터백 자원들과의 주전 경쟁에서 밀린 김민재는 올 시즌 후반기 좀처럼 출전 기회를 잡지 못하던 중이었다. 하지만 이날 더 리흐트의 부상으로 인해 모처럼 선발 기회를 부여 받아 그라운드를 누볐다. 지난달 21일 우니온 베를린과의 분데스리가 경기 이후 2경기 만에 출전을 알린 것은 물론, UCL 경기 선발로는 라치오와의 16강 1차전 이후 약 2달 만이었다.
간만의 출전에다가 풀타임까지 소화했지만, 아쉬움이 남는 경기력으로 고개를 떨궜다. 그는 팀이 2-1로 앞선 후반 37분, 비니시우스 주니오르의 패스를 받으려던 호드리구를 발로 넘어뜨리면서 경고와 함께 상대에게 페널티킥(PK)을 내주고 말았다. 키커로 나선 비니시우스가 이를 문제없이 성공시키며 승부가 원점으로 돌아갔다. 뮌헨이 안방 승리를 놓친 결정적인 장면이었다.
앞서 뮌헨은 짜릿한 역전을 빚어둔 상태였다. 전반 24분 비니시우스가 선제골을 터뜨리며 레알에 리드를 내줬지만, 후반 8분 레로이 자네의 동점골과 12분 해리 케인의 PK 성공으로 2-1 리드 체인지에 성공했다. 하지만 김민재의 결정적인 실책에 울고 말았다.
승리에 닿았다면, 특별한 의미가 더해지는 중요한 한판이었다. 뮌헨은 레알과의 UCL 맞대결에서 마지막 승리를 거둔 것이 무려 12년 전, 2011∼2012시즌이다. 당시 준결승 1차전에서 2-1로 이겼다. 이후 최근 8경기에서는 레알이 8경기 연속 무패(6승2무)로 압도적인 상성을 보이고 있었다. 이번 시즌 결승 진출을 꿈꾸는 뮌헨이 반드시 넘어야 할 천적 관계였다. 그러나 목전에 둔 승리를 또 놓치고 말았다.
결승행 티켓 주인공을 가려야 할 두 팀은 오는 9일 오전 4시 스페인 마드리드의 산티아고 베르나베우에서 열릴 2차전에서 다시 창을 겨눈다.
한편, 반대편 브라켓의 준결승에서는 이강인이 활약하는 파리 생제르맹(PSG)과 도르트문트가 맞붙는다. 두 팀의 1차전은 오는 2일 오전 4시에 펼쳐진다.

Article: 간판타자가 부상으로 빠진다.
미국 메이저리그(MLB) LA 에인절스가 자랑하는 스타 플레이어, 마이크 트라웃이 수술대에 오른다. MLB 공식 홈페이지 MLB닷컴은 1일 페리 미나시안 에인절스 단장의 말을 인용해 “트라웃이 왼쪽 무릎 반월판 파열로 수술을 받는다”고 전했다.
미나시안 단장이 구체적인 그의 수술 일정은 공개하지 않았지만 현지 언론에 따르면 그의 수술은 오는 4일 진행될 예정이다. MLB닷컴은 “트라웃은 시즌 아웃될 정도의 부상은 아닌 것으로 예상된다”고 설명했으나, 부상 부위를 고려해 볼 때 장기간 이탈이 불가피하다. 시즌 아웃을 피한 건 말 그대로 ‘불행 중 다행’인 수준이다.
트라웃은 전날(30일) 열린 필라델피아 필리스전에서 3회부터 무릎에 미세한 통증을 느꼈다고 전해졌다. 그로 인해 정밀 검진을 거친 결과 왼쪽 무릎 반월판 손상이 확인된 것. 반월판은 무릎에 붙어 있는 반달 모양의 연골로 무릎에 가해지는 충격을 흡수하는 기능을 하는 섬유연골성 조직이다.
2011년 빅리그에 데뷔해 14시즌째 에인절스 프랜차이즈 스타로 활약 중인 트라웃은 팀을 넘어 미국 전체를 대표하는 최고의 타자다. 통산 1518경기 타율 0.299 378홈런 954타점 등을 남겼다. 2012년 신인왕에 이어 아메리칸리그(AL) 최우수선수(MVP) 3회 수상, 실버슬러거 9회 수상, 올스타 11회 선정 등 화려한 커리어를 자랑한다.
하지만 최근 몇 년간 잦은 부상에 신음한다. 2021시즌에는 종아리 부상으로 4개월 결장을 알렸고, 2022시즌에는 허리 부상으로 1달 정도 쉼표를 찍었다. 직전 시즌도 왼손 유구골 부상에 시달려 시즌을 절반 가까이 날렸다. 3시즌 간 팀이 치른 486경기 중 237경기 출전에 그칠 정도였다.
절치부심한 그는 올 시즌 29경기에서 타율 0.220, 10홈런 14타점 등을 남겼다. 타율은 받쳐주지 못했으나 파워를 보여주며 AL 공동 1위까지 올라서기도 했다. 하지만 또다시 부상 악령을 피하지 못하고 자리를 비우게 됐다.
지난 겨울 첫 자유계약선수(FA) 신분을 얻은 세계 최고의 야구 스타, 오타니 쇼헤이를 연고지 라이벌팀 LA 다저스로 떠나보낸 에인절스는 힘든 시즌을 치르는 중이다. AL 서부지구에서 11승18패로 5할 승률에 한참 미치지 못한 채 4위에 머무르는 수준이다. 여기에 트라웃까지 이탈하고 말았다. 그야말로 최악의 시즌을 대비해야 하는 위기에 처했다.

Article: 할리우드 스타 앤 해서웨이(41)가 40대에 들어 '금주(禁酒) 5년'이란 이정표를 달성했다며 나이 마흔은 자신에게 축복으로 느껴진다고 밝혔다.
30일(현지시간) 미 일간 뉴욕타임스(NYT)에 따르면 해서웨이는 최근 이 신문과 인터뷰에서 '40대를 맞아 중년의 나이에 대해 어떻게 생각하느냐'는 질문에 "나는 그렇게 심각하게 받아들이지 않는다"며 "내가 이정표로 여기는 다른 많은 것들이 있기 때문"이라고 답했다.
이어 "평소에는 잘 얘기하지 않는데, 내가 술을 안 마신 지 5년이 넘었다. 그것이 내게는 하나의 이정표로 느껴진다"며 "마흔은 선물처럼 느껴진다"고 덧붙였다.
그는 또 "사실 나는 (이 나이를) '중년'이라고 부르기를 주저한다"며 "내가 내일 차에 치일 수도 있고 우리는 이 나이가 중년인지 아닌지 모른다. 우리는 (미래의 일을) 아무것도 모른다"고 말했다.
NYT 기자가 이에 동의하면서도 '하루하루를 마지막인 것처럼 대하기는 가장 어려운 일 아니겠느냐'고 묻자 해서웨이는 "나도 젊은 시절에는 만성적으로 스트레스를 받았다"며 "그러다 어느 날 내가 내 삶을 너무 당연하게 여기고 있다고 생각했고, 하늘에서 갑자기 뭔가가 떨어져서 빛이 사라져버릴 수도 있다고 생각했다"고 답했다.
그러면서 "그 이후로는 '스트레스를 받는다고 죽지는 않을 거야'라고 나 자신에게 말한다"고 했다.
그는 무엇 때문에 그렇게 스트레스를 받았느냐는 질문에는 "숨을 쉬는 법을 몰랐다"며 "너무 많은 것들이 머릿속에 가득했다"고 털어놨다.
술을 마시는 것이 그런 스트레스를 푸는 한 방법이었냐는 물음에는 "아마도"라고 긍정했다.
NBC 투데이에 따르면 해서웨이는 2019년 1월 TV 토크쇼에 출연해 처음으로 금주를 결심했다고 밝혔다.
당시 그는 "지난 10월에 술을 끊었다"며 아들을 위해 "18년 동안" 금주를 유지할 계획이라고 말했다.
그는 배우인 남편 애덤 셜먼과의 사이에서 2016년 첫아들을 낳았고, 2019년 둘째 아들을 얻었다.
해서웨이는 영화 '프린세스 다이어리'(2001)로 데뷔해 '악마는 프라다를 입는다'(2006), '비커밍 제인'(2007), '러브&드럭스'(2010), '원 데이'(2011), '다크 나이트 라이즈'(2012), '레미제라블'(2012), '인터스텔라'(2014), '인턴'(2015) 등 수많은 흥행작을 냈다.

Article: 98세의 우크라이나 여성이 지팡이에 의지한 채 홀로 6마일(약 10㎞)을 걸어 러시아 점령지에서 탈출했다고 영국 일간 가디언이 30일(현지시간) 보도했다.
그는 탈출 과정에서 헤어진 가족과도 무사히 재회할 수 있었다.
리디아 스테파니우나 로미코우스카 할머니는 지난주 러시아군의 침공으로 전투가 격화되자 가족과 함께 우크라이나 도네츠크 동부의 최전방 마을인 오체레티네를 떠나기로 결정했다.
할머니는 도네츠크 경찰이 게시한 영상 인터뷰에서 "사방에서 총소리가 들리는 가운데 잠에서 깼는데 너무 무서웠다"고 말했다.
출발 당시 혼란 속에서 그는 아들과 두 며느리 등 가족과 헤어지게 됐다. 젊은 가족들은 우회로를, 자신은 주도로를 탈출로로 택했다. 가족 중에는 며칠 전 파편에 맞아 다친 이도 있었다.
한 손에 지팡이를, 다른 한 손엔 나무 조각을 들고서 몸을 지탱한 할머니는 음식과 물 없이 하루 종일 걸어 탈출에 성공했다.
피난 과정은 험난했다. 두 번이나 넘어져 쉬어야 했고, 한번은 잠을 자고서야 걸어갈 수 있었다고 한다.
그는 "한번은 균형을 잃고 잡초 속으로 넘어졌는데 잠이 들었고 잠시 후 계속 걸었다. 그리고서 다시 넘어졌다"며 "하지만 일어나서 조금씩 조금씩 계속 걸어야겠다고 생각했다"고 회상했다.
홀로 길을 걷던 할머니는 저녁에야 우크라이나 군인들에 의해 발견됐다.
군인들은 최전방 지역 시민을 대피시키는 경찰 부대 '화이트 앤젤스'에 할머니를 인계했으며, 화이트 앤젤스는 할머니를 피난민 대피소로 데려간 뒤 가족들에게 연락했다고 파블로 디아첸코 경찰 대변인이 전했다.
제2차 세계대전에서도 살아남았다는 로미코우스카는 "나도 이 전쟁을 겪고 있으며, 결국 아무것도 남지 않았다. 이번 전쟁은 그때(제2차 세계대전)와 다르다. 불에 탄 집이 한 채도 없었는데, 이번에는 모든 게 불타고 있다"고 말했다.
천신만고 끝에 탈출에 성공한 할머니는 뜻하지 않은 행운도 잡게 됐다.
우크라이나 최대 규모 은행 중 하나인 모노뱅크의 올레 호로코우스키 최고 경영자는 이날 자신의 텔레그램에서 로미코우스카 할머니에게 집을 기증하겠다고 밝혔다.
호로코우스키 최고 경영자는 "모노뱅크는 로미코우스카 할머니에게 집을 사줄 것이며, 그녀는 이 가증스러운 것(러시아)이 우리 땅에서 사라질 때까지 그 집에 살게 될 것"이라고 말했다.

Article: 경기도에서 사찰을 운영하는 60대 승려 A씨는 지난해 12월 말 휴대전화로 유명 개그맨 B씨 이름을 포털 사이트에서 검색했다.
B씨가 주식 투자로 큰돈을 벌었다는 이야기를 TV 방송 프로그램에서 들은 기억이 떠올랐기 때문이다.
인터넷 게시물 여러 개를 옮겨 다닌 끝에 사회관계망서비스(SNS)로 연결됐고, 결국 포털사이트가 운영하는 '밴드'에도 가입했다. 단체대화방 이름은 '제2의2호 프로그램 777밴드'였다.
대화방에 입장하자 한 여성이 B씨의 매니저라고 자신을 소개했다. 이름은 '한우희'였다. 그는 A씨 포함 50여명인 대화방 참여자들에게 "개그맨 B씨가 3천억원을 갖고 있다"며 솔깃한 제안을 했다.
그러면서 "회원님들이 투자하면 B씨 돈과 합쳐 비상장 주식을 한 주당 15만원에 살 수 있다"며 "1주일 뒤 상장시키면 주당 가격이 25만원을 넘는다"고 꾀었다.
매일 오후 7시 30분에는 "B씨가 직접 밴드에서 주식 강연을 한다"고 했고, A씨는 꼬박꼬박 그 강연을 챙겨봤다.
A씨는 고민 끝에 큰 결심을 했다. 지난 2월 5일 매니저가 카카오톡으로 따로 알려준 가상계좌로 3천만원을 보냈다. 사흘 뒤 2천만원을 추가로 송금했고, 그의 주식 투자는 같은 달 말까지 이어졌다.
한 달 사이 투자금은 지인에게 빌린 2억3천만원을 포함해 3억원으로 늘었다. 며칠 뒤 매니저는 A씨 주식이 크게 올라 원금과 수익금을 합쳐 29억8천만원이 됐다고 알렸다.
그러나 지난 3월 초 A씨가 "원금과 수익금을 배당해 달라"고 하자 매니저의 태도가 돌변했다. "29억원을 찾으려면 10%인 2억9천만원을 계좌로 먼저 보내야 한다"고 요구했다.
그제야 지인들에게 주식 투자 사실을 털어놓은 A씨는 유명인 사칭 투자 사기라는 사실을 알게 됐고, 뒤늦게 땅을 치고 후회하며 경찰서를 찾았다.
A씨는 "조금씩 모아둔 돈으로 투자했고 수익이 나면 사찰 보수 공사도 하고 절 행사 때도 쓰려고 했다"며 "사기인 줄은 꿈에도 몰랐다"고 토로했다.
그는 "지금 생각해보면 한우희라는 매니저 이름도 가짜고 그가 보내준 사원증과 사업자등록증도 모두 위조한 것 같다"며 "'제발 좀 살려달라'고 부탁도 했는데…"라고 울먹였다.
'한우희' 매니저를 포함한 일당에게 사기를 당한 피해자는 A씨뿐만이 아니었다. 지난 3월부터 서울·인천·부산 등 전국 경찰서에 고소장 40여건이 잇따라 접수됐다.
B씨의 공범으로 추정되는 대표 2명은 전직 장관 출신이 운영하는 사모투자 전문회사와 유사한 '스카이레이크'(SKYLAKE)라는 이름으로 불법 투자중개업체를 운영하며 피해자들을 속였다.
대표 2명 가운데 한 명은 해당 장관 출신과 실제로 같은 이름을 사용했다. 피해자 대부분은 단체 대화방에서 매니저 등 바람잡이의 말에 속아 투자했다가 수억원씩을 사기당했다.
경찰청에 따르면 유명인 사칭을 포함한 '투자 리딩방' 불법행위 피해 건수는 지난해 9월부터 4개월 동안 1천 건이 넘었으며 피해액은 1천200억원을 웃돌았다.
최근 사칭 리딩방 사건이 잇따르자 또 다른 피해자인 유명인들도 지난달 기자회견을 열고 대책 마련을 촉구하는 성명을 발표하기도 했다.
경찰청은 전국에서 피해자가 늘자 최근 인천경찰청 형사기동대를 집중 수사 관서로 지정하고 '한우희' 일당 사건 수사에 본격적으로 착수했다.
인천경찰청이 전국에서 취합한 고소장은 토대로 현재까지 파악한 피해 금액은 15억원대로 확인됐다.
경찰은 고소장이 추가로 계속 들어올 것으로 보고 있으며 용의자들을 추적하는 등 수사를 확대하고 있다.
경찰 관계자는 1일 "이번 사건의 피해자가 많아 고소장이 언제까지 계속 들어올지, 피해 금액이 최종 얼마일지는 가늠하기 어렵다"면서 "최대한 신속하게 수사할 방침"이라고 말했다.

Article: 대미 수출, 3개월 연속 대중 수출 역전…4월 수입 5.4% 늘어
무역수지 11개월 연속 흑자…누적 흑자 106억달러로 2023년 전체 적자 넘어
한국의 4월 수출이 지난해 동기보다 13.8% 증가하면서 7개월 연속 '수출 플러스'를 기록했다.
자동차 수출은 67억9천만달러로 역대 최대액을 경신했고, 반도체를 비롯한 디스플레이·무선통신·컴퓨터 등 4대 정보기술(IT) 분야 품목의 수출 증가율도 모두 동시에 플러스를 이어갔다.
산업통상자원부는 1일 이 같은 내용의 4월 수출입 동향을 발표했다.
4월 수출액은 562억6천만달러로 작년 같은 달보다 13.8% 늘어났다.
월 수출 증가율은 작년 10월 플러스 전환 이후 7개월 연속으로 이 같은 흐름을 이어가고 있다.
핵심 주력 품목인 반도체 수출도 지난해 부진에서 완전히 벗어나 6개월 연속 증가세를 이어갔다.
4월 반도체 수출액은 99억6천만달러로 작년 같은 달과 비교해 56.1% 증가하며 역대 4월 중 두 번째로 높은 실적을 신고했다.
인공지능(AI) 서버 투자 확대 등 IT 전방 산업의 수요 확대 흐름 속에서 D램과 낸드 등 메모리 반도체 단가가 상승하고 수출 물량도 늘어나면서 전체적인 수출액 증가로 이어졌다.
4대 IT 품목인 반도체, 디스플레이, 컴퓨터, 무선통신기기는 지난 3월에 24개월 만에 처음으로 전 품목 수출이 동반 증가한 데 이어 2개월 연속으로 같은 흐름을 이어갔다.
디스플레이(16.3%)와 컴퓨터(76.2%)는 각각 9개월, 4개월 연속으로 수출이 증가했고, 무선통신기기(11.4%) 수출도 2개월 연속 증가했다.
전기차 판매 증가세 둔화로 지난 2∼3월 마이너스를 기록했던 자동차 수출은 4월 67억9천만달러로 전년 동월 대비 10.3% 증가해 역대 최대액을 경신하며 플러스로 돌아섰다.
특히 고가의 친환경차와 스포츠유틸리티차(SUV) 수출 확대로 수출 단가가 상승하는 가운데 수출 물량도 작년보다 증가하면서 작년 11월(65억3천만달러) 세웠던 사상 최대 실적 기록을 5개월 만에 다시 썼다.
자동차를 비롯해 바이오헬스(21.3%) 수출이 올해 처음 두 자릿수 증가율을 기록한 것을 비롯해 석유제품(19.0%), 석유화학(12.3%), 가전(9.4%), 선박(5.6%), 자동차 부품(2.9%), 섬유(1.7%), 일반기계(1.5%) 등 한국의 15대 주력 수출 품목 중 13개의 수출이 증가했다.
다만, 이차전지(-20.1%)와 철강(-5.7%) 등 2개 품목은 수출이 뒷걸음질쳤다.
지역별로는 양대 수출국인 중국과 미국으로의 수출이 모두 증가했다.
대미 수출은 작년보다 24.3% 증가한 114억달러로 사상 최대를 기록하며 9개월 연속 증가 흐름을 이어갔다. 대중국 수출은 작년보다 9.9% 증가한 105억달러로 2개월 연속 100억달러를 넘기며 수출 증가세를 이어갔다.
대중 수출도 회복세지만 강한 대미 수출 호조세가 이어지면서 4월도 대미 수출이 대중 수출보다 많았다.
한중 수교 이후 한국의 최대 수출국은 중국이었지만, 월간 기준으로 작년 12월 대미 수출이 대중 수출보다 많아지는 현상이 20여년 만에 나타난 데 이어 지난 2월부터 3개월 연속 대미 수출이 대중 수출을 넘어서는 등 미중 패권 경쟁이 초래한 세계 공급망 재편 속에서 무역 지형이 변하는 모습이 나타나고 있다.
한국의 4월 수입액은 547억3천만달러로 작년 같은 달보다 5.4% 늘었다. 수입 증가는 작년 2월 이후 14개월 만이다.
정유사 가동률 상승과 발전용·산업용 가스 도입 수요 증가에 따라 원유(17.8%), 가스(21.9%) 등 에너지 수입액이 늘어난 것이 전체 수입 증가에 영향을 미친 것으로 나타났다.
이로써 4월 무역수지는 15억3천만달러 흑자를 기록했다.
월간 무역수지는 작년 6월 이후로 11개월 연속으로 흑자가 이어지고 있다.
한편 올해 1∼4월 누적 무역수지는 106억달러로 작년 전체 적자 규모(103억달러)를 뛰어넘으며 5년 만에 최대 흑자를 달성했다.
안덕근 산업부 장관은 "4월에는 이스라엘·이란 분쟁, 홍해 사태 장기화 등으로 인한 유가, 환율, 물류비 등의 높은 변동성에도 수출이 강건한 호조세를 보이며 무역수지 흑자를 달성했다"며 "2분기 전체적으로도 반도체 등 IT 품목의 수출 증가세와 자동차 등 주력 품목의 수출 호조세가 지속될 것으로 기대되는 만큼, 정부도 5월 중 범부처 수출 추가지원대책을 마련하고 수출 현장 지원단을 중심으로 기업의 애로를 즉각 해소하는 등 수출 우상향 흐름에 박차를 가하겠다"고 말했다.

Article: 세종시의 한 학원가 건물에서 한 초등학생이 킥보드를 던져 그 밑을 지나던 중학생 2명이 다치는 사고가 발생했다.
지난달 30일 경찰 등 관계자에 따르면 떨어진 킥보드로 인해 하교 중이던 중학생 무리 중 두명이 키보드에 맞아 머리와 다리에 부상을 입었다.
해당 건물은 외벽 통로마다 유리 벽이 높게 쳐져 있는 곳이다.
머리를 맞은 학생은 생명에는 지장이 없었지만 이마 오른쪽이 심하게 부어 올랐다. 또 사고 당시엔 충격으로 정신을 잃기도 한 것으로 알려졌다.
경찰이 건물 CCTV 분석을 통해 붙잡은 용의자는 저학년 초등학생이다.
경찰은 “범행 동기를 조사한 뒤 폭행 혐의를 적용하겠다는 입장”이라면서도 “다만 용의자가 만 10살이 안된 형사미성년자여서 처벌로 이어지기는 쉽지 않아 보인다”고 말했다.
현행 형법 제9조에 따르면 만 14세 미만은 범죄를 저질러도 처벌을 받지 않는다. 만 10~14세 미만인 형사미성년자(촉법소년)는 범행을 저질렀더라도 형사처벌을 받지 않고 보호관찰이나 사회봉사 명령 등 보호처분만 받는다.

Article: 미국 공화당 대선 후보인 도널드 트럼프 전 대통령이 한국이 비용을 더 부담하지 않으면 주한미군을 철수할 수 있다고 시사했다.
방위비를 부담하지 않는 북대서양조약기구(NATO·나토) 회원국을 공격하도록 러시아를 부추기겠다는 발언으로 ‘안보 무임승차론’을 꺼낸 트럼프 전 대통령이 한국에도 방위비 분담금 증액 가능성을 언급한 것으로 풀이된다.
미국 시사주간지 타임지는 30일(현지시간), 트럼프 전 대통령과 12일에 진행한 인터뷰 기사를 보도했다. 트럼프 전 대통령은 인터뷰에서 주한미군과 관련 “우리는 위험한 위치에 4만명(실제는 2만8500명)의 병력이 있다”면서 “이것은 말이 안 된다. 왜 우리가 다른 사람을 방어하느냐”고 말했다. 트럼프 전 대통령은 이어 “우리는 지금 아주 부유한 나라(very wealthy country)에 대해 말하고 있는 것”이라고 말했다.
타임지는 트럼프 전 대통령의 발언에 대해 ‘한국이 점점 더 호전적인 북한 김정은 정권을 막기 위한 주한미군을 더 많이 지원하지 않는다면 철수할 수 있다고 시사(suggest)했다’고 해석했다.
한·미 양국은 정기적으로 방위비분담특별협정(SMA)을 체결, 주한미군 주둔비용과 관련해 한국이 부담해야 할 비용을 정하고 있다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 첫 임기 때인 2019년에 방위비 분담금으로 전년도 분담금의 6배에 가까운 액수를 요구하며 증액을 압박한 바 있다. 트럼프 전 대통령은 재임 중 한국에서 주둔비용으로 50억달러(약 6조9000억원)를 받지 못하면 미군을 철수하라고 말하기도 한 것으로 알려졌으며 미국 국방부가 백악관에 주한미군 감축과 관련한 옵션을 보고했다는 보도도 나온 바 있다.
한·미 양국은 트럼프 전 대통령의 급격한 방위비 인상 요구에 트럼프 행정부 때 방위비 협상을 타결하지 못했다가 조 바이든 행정부가 출범한 뒤에 협상을 끝냈다. 당시 1년 반 정도 협정 공백 사태가 벌어지기도 했다.
한·미 양국은 지난 3월 2026년부터 적용될 제12차 SMA 체결을 위한 협상 대표를 동시에 임명하며 차기 SMA 협상 조기 착수를 공식화한 바 있다. 한·미는 2021년에 2020년부터 2025년까지 6년간 적용되는 11차 SMA를 타결했다. 11차 SMA 종료 기한을 2년 가까이 남겨둔 시점에 양국이 차기 SMA를 위한 협상을 시작하는 것은 이례적이라는 평가가 나온다. 정부가 올해 안에 협상을 마무리하는 방안을 검토 중인 것으로도 알려졌다. 이를 두고 트럼프 전 미국 대통령이 오는 11월 재집권할 가능성을 염두에 둔 포석이라는 해석도 나왔다. 한·미 양국이 새 협상을 타결해도 트럼프 전 대통령의 대선 승리로 내년에 트럼프 2기 정부가 출범할 경우 미국 측에서 새 협상을 요구할 가능성이 있다는 관측도 나온다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 타임지와의 인터뷰에서 나토에 대해 “만약 돈을 내지 않는다면, 당신들이 알아서 해야 한다(you're on your own)”고도 기존 입장을 재확인했다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 우크라이나 지원에 대해서는 “유럽(지원)이 같아지기 시작하기 전에는 주지 않을 것”이라면서 “유럽이 더 크게 영향을 받는다. 유럽이 돈을 안 내는데 왜 우리가 내야 하느냐. 우리는 (유럽과 사이에) 바다가 있다”고 말했다. 타임지는 미국과 유럽연합(EU) 국가 모두 1000억 달러 이상을 각각 우크라이나에 지원했다고 전했다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 우크라이나에 대한 지원이 중국의 대만 침공 저지에 중요하다는 대만 외교부 장관의 최근 발언과 관련, “공산주의 중국 지도자들은 그와 같은 일들은 쉽게 이뤄질 수 없다는 것을 알아야 한다”고 말했지만, 대만 방어에 나설지에 대해서는 답변하지 않았다고 타임지는 전했다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 “만약 이란이 이스라엘을 공격한다면 우리는 거기에 있을 것”이라면서 이스라엘은 방어하겠다는 입장을 확인했다. 다만 이스라엘이 가자지구에서의 전쟁을 조속히 끝내야 한다는 입장을 재차 밝혔다.
트럼프 전 대통령은 타임지와 인터뷰에서 모든 수입품에 10% 이상의 이른바 보편관세를 부과하는 것을 고려하고 있다고 말했다. 일부 중국산 제품에 대해서는 100%의 관세도 고려하고 있다고 밝히며 보호 무역주의 강화를 예고했다. 타임지는 트럼프 전 대통령이 관세가 미국 경제를 외국 제조업의 지배에서 해방시키고 미국의 산업 르네상스를 촉진할 것이라고 말했다고 전했다. 매체는 트럼프 전 대통령과 측근들은 트럼프 1기 행정부에서 연평균 물가 상승률이 2% 미만이었다는 점을 근거로 관세가 물가를 올리지 않았다고 주장했다고도 전했다.
트럼프는 대선 경쟁자인 조 바이든 대통령을 수사하기 위한 특검을 임명할 가능성도 거론했다.
그는 “나는 대통령직을 매우 존경하기 때문에 바이든을 해치고 싶지 않다”면서도 “그러나 법원이 대통령에게 면책권이 없다고 말할 경우 바이든은 그의 모든 범죄로 기소될 것”이라고 밝혔다.

Article: 조나단이 과거 지코가 찍었던 광고 인터뷰와 실제 사실에 차이점을 발견해 ‘자본주의’라고 언급하자 지코가 해명에 나섰다.
지난달달 30일 유튜브 채널 ‘동네스타K’에는 ‘열심히 살자.. 중소돌에서 대기업 레이블 수장돼도 제니 섭외전화 직접 돌리는 지코처럼’이라는 제목의 영상이 게재됐다. 공개된 영상에서는 최근 신곡 ‘SPOT!’을 발매한 지코가 게스트로 등장해 여러 일화를 털어놨다.
이날 조나단은 지코에게 “중소돌로 시작해서 대기업 레이블 설립까지 했다”며 “열심히 살고 있는데 중소와 대기업의 가장 큰 차이점은 뭐냐”고 질문했다. 그는 “자금력 자체가 다르고 주어진 환경과 기회도 (제약이) 적다”고 소개했다. 이어 “나는 중소도 아닌 거의 맨땅에서 시작했다”고 회상하기도.
앞서 지코는 2011년 브랜뉴스타덤엔터테인먼트에서 ‘블락비’로 데뷔해 소속사와 분쟁하는 등 논란을 겪었으며 현재 하이브 소속 KOZ 엔터테인먼트를 설립한 바 있다.
조나단은 “저희도 지코씨에 대해서 많이 공부했다”며 “줏대 없이 자본주의에 굴복하셨다”고 서두를 열었다. 그는 증거로 지코가 과거 진행했던 맥주 광고 인터뷰를 공개했다. 해당 인터뷰에서 지코는 “평소에도 카스를 즐기시냐”는 질문에 “다른 맥주도 아닌 카스를 마시곤 한다”고 답변하고 있었다.
그러나 조나단이 공개한 증거에는 지코의 절친한 친구로 알려진 크러쉬가 “너 카스 안 좋아하잖아 우지호(지코의 본명)”라는 댓글이 있었다. 이를 본 지코는 “얘 이랬어요?”라며 배신감을 표하며 “언제 작성한 건가요?”라고 질문했다. 이에 조나단이 캡처된 사진을 보며 “2시간 전이요”라고 농담해 현장을 폭소케 했다.
지코는 본격적으로 해명에 나섰다. 그는 “고깃집에 가면 맥주 포스터가 붙어있다”면서 “나도 저기 걸려보고 싶었다”고 솔직하게 털어놨다. 조나단 역시 “메인의 어떤 증명이다”라고 공감하기도. 이어 지코는 “기호가 뭐가 중요하겠습니까”라고 너스레를 떨며 미소 지었다.
그러나 조나단은 줏대 없음의 절정이 있다며 다른 사건을 언급했다. 그는 “2018년부터 2023년까지 연세대 축제를 가셨다”며 “작년에는 5일 뒤에 고려대 축제를 갔더라”고 공개했다. 당황한 지코는 “기억이 나지 않는다”며 고개를 숙였지만 조나단은 “두 탕 뛰느라 바쁜 지코씨”라고 마무리해 웃음을 유발했다.
지코는 지난 26일 신곡 ‘SPOT!’을 발매했다. 이는 2022년 7월 이후 약 1년9개월 만에 발매한 신보로 블랙핑크 제니가 피처링에 참여해 더욱 화제를 모았다.

Article: 코로나19 발생 후 1580일간의 대응 기록이 한 자리에 모여 언제든 열람 가능하게 된다. 1일부터 코로나19 위기단계가 ‘관심’으로 낮춰지면서 병원에서의 마스크 착용 의무도 해제된다.
◆“1580일 코로나 대응 기록 공개”
질병관리청은 정부, 지자체, 공공기관, 병원 등 각 기관이 발간한 코로나19 백서를 국민이 한 곳에서 손쉽게 찾아볼 수 있도록 1일부터 온‧오프라인 열람 서비스를 개시한다고 밝혔다.
코로나19 백서는 2020년 1월 이후 4년 3개월 간 코로나19에 대응하면서 얻은 경험과 교훈을 기록한 자료다. 미래 팬데믹 대비‧대응에 활용할 수 있는 중요한 자료이나, 정부 기관과 각 지자체 등 전국에 산재돼 이를 검색하거나 활용하기 어려웠다.
1일부터 각 기관이 발간한 백서 자료들을 ‘질병관리청 국립의과학지식센터(충북 청주시 오송읍 소재)’에서 찾아볼 수 있다. 아울러 국립의과학지식센터 방문이 어려운 사용자들을 위해 누리집(https://library.nih.go.kr)을 통한 온라인 검색 서비스도 개시한다.
현재 이용 가능한 코로나19 대응 백서는 총 68개다. 질병관리청은 앞으로도 지속적으로 백서를 수집해 새로운 팬데믹 대비·대응을 위한 다양한 연구 및 정책개발에도 적극 활용될 수 있도록 관리·서비스할 계획이다.
지영미 질병관리청장은 “코로나19 위기 단계가 가장 낮은 수준인 ‘관심’으로 하향되는 1일, 전국 각 기관의 코로나19 대응 노력이 집약된 백서 등 대응 기록을 국민에게 알릴 수 있게 되어 의미가 크다”며 “코로나19가 남긴 상처와 교훈을 잊지 않고 다음 팬데믹에 철저하게 대비하기 위해 코로나19 백서를 활용하는 것이 중요하다”고 강조했다.
◆“병원 마스크 착용 의무 해제”
코로나19 위기 단계 조정에 따라 이날부터 큰 병원에서 반드시 마스크를 착용하지 않아도 된다.
질병관리청에 따르면 이날부터 코로나19 위기 단계가 ‘경계’에서 ‘관심’으로 변경된 데 따라 병원급 의료기관에 남아있던 마스크 착용 의무가 해제됐다.
코로나19 중앙사고수습본부는 지난 19일 이 같은 내용의 위기 단계 하향을 예고했다. 감염병 위기 단계는 ‘심각-경계-주의-관심’으로 구성되는데, 코로나19의 경우 지난해 6월 ‘심각’에서 ‘경계’로 하향된 데 이어 11개월 만에 가장 낮은 단계로 내려갔다.
위기 단계 하향에 따라 남아 있던 방역 조치는 대부분 사라진다.
병원급 의료기관과 입소형 감염 취약시설에 의무로 남아있던 마스크 착용도 이제는 ‘권고 사항’이 됐다. 요양병원 등 감염 취약 시설 입소자를 대상으로 해야 했던 선제 검사도 의무에서 권고로 바뀐다.
코로나19 확진자 격리를 권고하는 기준도 변경된다.
기존에는 검체 채취일로부터 5일 격리를 권고했으나, 이제 발열이나 기침 등 코로나19 주요 증상이 호전된 후 24시간 격리를 권고하는 걸로 한층 더 완화된다. 증상이 나아지면 하루 정도 격리한 뒤 일상생활에 복귀하면 된다는 뜻이다.
코로나19 검사비는 기본적으로 지원하지 않는다.
다만, 먹는 치료제 대상군, 의료취약지역 소재 요양기관 환자, 응급실 내원 환자, 중환자실 입원환자 중 유증상자에 대해서만 신속항원검사(RAT) 비용을 6000∼9000원가량 지원한다. 팍스로비드 등 먹는 코로나19 치료제는 무상 지원에서 1인당 본인부담금 5만원을 받는 것으로 변경한다.
의료급여 수급권자, 차상위 계층 등에게는 무상 지원이 유지된다. 코로나19 백신은 2023∼2024절기 접종까지만 전 국민 무료 접종을 유지하기로 했다. 다음 절기부터는 65세 이상 고령층, 면역 저하자 등 고위험군에만 무료로 접종한다.

Article: ‘담배 냄새나는 집에서 살며 일할 순 없다.’
일본의 한 20대 여성 공무원이 업무를 거부하다 징계를 받은 이유다.
1일 아사히신문에 따르면 효고현 가와니시시 소속 A씨는 지난 3월 1년 간의 국토교통성 연수파견을 시작하며 시에서 마련한 도쿄 임대주택에 입주했다. 하지만 A씨는 파견 첫날만 출근하고 업무를 거부했다. 임대주택 청소상태가 엉망이라는 게 문제였다. A씨는 “담배 냄새가 가득하고, 환풍기에는 먼지가 쌓여 있다”는 등 청소가 제대로 되지 않았다며 “연수를 계속할 수 있는 상태가 아니다”고 불만을 터뜨렸다.
가와니시시는 새로운 주택을 마련하기로 약속했고, A씨는 일단 호텔로 옮기도록 했다. 하지만 A씨의 업무 거부는 계속됐다. “생활 기반인 거주 환경이 갖춰지지 않아 연수를 계속하는 건 불가능하다. 징계를 받아도 상관없다”는 입장이었다고 한다.
결국 가와니시시는 지난달 12일 A씨의 파견 중지를 결정하고 경고 처분을 내렸다. A씨를 대신해 해당 업무에 발령이 난 다른 직원은 새로운 임대 주택에 입주했다.

Article: 엔화 가치가 내려가는 ‘엔저 현상’이 지속되면서 외국인 관광객 이용 금액과 내국인 관광객 이용 금액을 달리 하는 이른바 ‘이중가격제’를 도입하는 일본 내 상점이 늘고 있다.
지난 12일 도쿄 시부야구에 새롭게 문을 연 한 해물·BBQ 뷔페는 외국인에 제 값을 받고 일본인에 할인해주는 ‘이중 가격제’를 도입했다. 음식점 공식 사회관계망서비스(SNS)에 “일본인, 내국인이라면 할인”이라며 ‘보통’ 가격 6578엔(한화 약 5만 7780원)과 ‘일본인’ 가격 5478엔(한화 약 4만 8120원)라고 안내했다. 여행객과 달리 일본인과 일본에 거주하는 외국인에는 1만원 가까이 할인된 가격에 음식을 제공하는 것이다.
이는 엔데믹과 엔저 현상이 맞물리면서 방일 외국인 수가 급증했고, 이것이 오버투어리즘(관광공해)을 야기한 데 따른 것으로 풀이된다.
이 음식점 주인은 지난달 26일 일본 후지뉴스네트워크(FNN)와 인터뷰서 “오래 지속되는 엔저 현상에 (일본인들이) 조금이라도 해물 뷔페를 즐겨줬으면 한다”고 말했다.
지난 2월은 나가야마 히스노리 일본 료칸협회 부회장은 일본에 ‘이중 가격제’를 도입해야 한다고 주장한 바 있다.
그는 “싱가포르에서는 테마파크나 슈퍼마켓, 레스토랑 등에서 거주자에게 할인 혜택을 주는 방법으로 이중가격제를 운영한다”며 “외국인 관광객들은 돈을 더 내는 대신 패스트트랙이나 정중한 지원 등의 ‘좋은 불공정’의 혜택을 누리고 있다”고 말한 바 있다.
나가야마 부회장이 주장한 ‘이중가격제’는 일본 신분증 등 내국인임을 증명할 수 있는 서류를 내면 호텔, 음식점, 관광지 등에서 할인을 해주는 방식이다.
실제 일본 JR그룹은 외국인 관광객에게 판매하는 JK철도패스(7일권) 가격을 2만9650엔에서 5만 엔으로 69% 인상했다.
지난달 10일 일본정부관광국(JNTO)에 따르면, 지난해 일본을 찾은 외국인 관광객 수는 2506만6100명을 기록했다. 전체의 25%(695만명)는 한국인 관광객이 차지했다. 특히 올해 1월 방일 한국인은 월간 기준 역대 최대치인 85만7000명에 달했다.

Article: KB국민카드가 5월 가정의 달을 맞아 어린이날, 어버이날 등 기념일에 선물, 계획 관련 설문조사를 진행한 결과 용돈이 선물 1순위로 꼽혔다.
1일 국민카드는 고객 패널 ‘이지 토커’440여명을 대상으로 가정의 달 선물 준비, 기념일 계획 등에 대한 설문조사와 함께 5월 주요 기념일에 발생한 신용카드 및 체크카드 매출 데이터로 외식 소비를 분석했다.
◆ 어린이날 58%, 어버이날 92%, 용돈(현금·상품권) 응답 가장 많아
우선 조사 결과 5월 어린이날, 어버이날 등 주요 기념일에 선물 1위는 용돈(현금·상품권)으로 나타났다. 어린이날에는 용돈으로 5만 초과~10만 이하 41%, 어버이날에는 10만원 초과~20만원 이하를 준비한다는 답변이 29%로 가장 큰 비중을 차지했다.
◆ 용돈 이어, 어린이날 선물은 장난감 38%, 어버이날 꽃, 화분류 38%
용돈에 이어 선물 종류는 어린이날은 장난감(38%), 의류·잡화(14%), 어버이날에는 꽃(카네이션 등 38%), 건강식품(13%) 순이었고, 비율이 높지는 않지만 두 기념일 모두 마음을 담은 편지(모바일 메시지 포함)가 있는 점도 눈길을 끌었다.
◆ 기념일에 무얼할까? 가족 친인척과 식사 가장 높아, 어린이날 54%, 어버이날 88%
5월의 기념일에 무엇을 하는지에 대한 질문에는 ‘가족, 친인척 등 식사 모임을 한다’는 답변이 많은 기념일에 걸쳐 높게 나타났고, 뒤를 이어 영화, 놀이동산과 같은 문화생활, 쇼핑, 여행 등을 한다는 답변이 많았다. 근로자의 날에는 집에서 휴식을 한다가 48%로 주말처럼 일상에 쉼을 주는 하루로 보낸다는 답변이 많았다.
◆ 매출 증가 높은 외식 업종은 한식은 해산물, 양식은 패밀리레스토랑 매출 증가 TOP
무엇을 먹을지 고민이 많은 5월의 기념일에 어떤 음식이 평소 대비 가장 많이 선택을 받는지 최근 3년간 5월의 외식 소비데이터로 살펴봤다. 연도별로 5월 일평균 대비 어린이날과 어버이날에 매출 증가가 가장 높은 업종은 한식은 해산물(민물장어, 게요리 등), 양식은 패밀리레스토랑으로 나타났다.
KB국민카드 데이터사업그룹 관계자는 “설문 조사를 통해 가정의 달의 의미를 다시 한 번 확인할 수 있었다”며 “앞으로도 다양한 설문 조사를 데이터 분석과 결합해 소비 트렌드 변화를 살펴 볼 것”이라고 말했다.

Article: 맥도날드, 16개 메뉴 가격 평균 2.8%↑
김밥은 한 줄 3323원 6.4%↑
가격 인상 폭이 가장 큰 외식 품목 ‘냉면’
7.2% 올라 한 그릇에 평균 1만1462원
“양배추 한 통에 9500원, 말이 됩니까? 주먹보다 조금 큰 것은 4500원. 이렇게 살기 힘든 적은 처음입니다. 사과·배·고추·상추·양배추까지 가격만 봐도 숨이 턱턱 막힙니다. 30만원으로 장도 볼 수 없어요”
지난달 30일 오후 8시쯤 서울 종로구에 한 마트에서 만난 최모(56)씨가 허탈한 표정을 지으며 깊은 한숨을 내쉬었다. 이날 찾은 마트는 한산한 분위기였다. 마트에는 장바구니를 든 손님은 찾아 볼 수 없을 정도였다. 물건을 들었다 놓는 소비자들이 적잖게 눈에 띄었다.
이날 마트에서 만난 주부 이모(40)씨도 “방울토마토 1만4000원이나 해? 너무 올랐어요”라며 “이정도까진 아니었는데, 애들 때문에 안 살수도 없다”고 한탄했다.
고추·무·상추·양배추 등 밥상에 자주 오르는 먹거리 가격 상승세가 좀처럼 꺾이지 않고 있다.
1일 한국농수산식품유통공사에 따르면 지난달 29일 기준으로 양배추 8㎏의 도매가격은 최근 한 달 사이 56% 올랐고 1년 사이 113% 올랐다. 소매가로는 한 통에 6000원이 넘는다.
앞서 김병환 기획재정부 1차관은 지난달 26일 정부는 배추, 양배추, 당근 등 7종의 품목에 대해 다음 달 중 할당관세 0%를 신규적용하겠다“며 “4월 들어 오이, 애호박, 수입소고기, 갈치 등을 중심으로 농·축·수산물 가격이 전반적인 하락세를 보이고 있다”고 밝혔지만 농산물 가격은 잡힐 기미 보이지 않고 있다.
이날 종로구 한 한 김밥 전문점을 찾았다. 메뉴판에는 김밥 한 줄 4500원, 참치 김밥이나 치즈 김밥은 5500원. 기본 라면은 5000원이 적혀있었다. 라면과 김밥만 시켜도 1만 원대가 된다.
이날 늦은 저녁에 만난 최모(35)씨는 “버티는 것도 너무 힘들다”며 “아침은 굶다시피 하고, 저녁은 라면이나 김밥으로 간단하게 때운다”라고 했다. 이어 “빠듯한 월급에 점심도 구내식당 7000원에 맞춰먹는다”고 깊은 한숨을 쉬었다.
외식업체들도 오른 물가 부담을 덜기 위해 덩달아 가격을 올리면서 서민들의 고통은 가중 되고 있다. 치솟은 먹거리 물가가 꺾일 기미를 보이지 않으면서 직장인, 주부 할 것 없이 아우성을 지르고 있다. 특히 주머니가 가벼워도 고민 없이 한 끼를 때울 수 있는 김밥과 라면 값 조차 줄줄이 오르면서 시민들의 시름은 더욱 깊어가고 있다.
이뿐만 아니다. 햄버거·피자·치킨 등 주요 외식 품목 가격이 모두 인상 발표했다. 가정의 달 5월에는 외식 부담이 더 커질 것으로 보인다.
지난달 28일 한국소비자원의 가격정보 종합 포털 참가격에 따르면 지난달 냉면, 김밥 등 대표 외식 품목 8개의 서울 지역 평균 가격은 1년 전보다 최대 7%대 올랐다. 가격 인상 폭이 가장 큰 외식 품목은 냉면으로 7.2% 올라 한 그릇에 평균 1만1462원이다.
김밥은 한 줄에 3323원으로 6.4% 상승했고 비빔밥은 한 그릇에 1만769원으로 5.7% 비싸졌다. 또 김치찌개 백반과 자장면은 각각 8000원, 7069원으로 4.0% 올랐고 칼국수 한 그릇은 9038원으로 3.5%, 삼계탕은 한 그릇에 1만6846원으로 3.1% 각각 상승했다. 삼겹살도 1인분(200g)에 1만9514원으로 1년 전보다 1.4% 비싸졌다.
이달에는 프랜차이즈 업계가 본격적으로 가격 인상에 나섰다. 김밥 프랜차이즈 바르다김선생은 지난 9일 메뉴 가격을 100∼500원 인상해 대표 메뉴인 바른김밥 가격이 4300원에서 4500원으로 올랐다. 앞서 김가네는 지난해 하반기 가격 인상을 단행했다.
치킨 프랜차이즈 굽네는 지난 15일 9개 메뉴 가격을 일제히 1900원씩 올렸다. 이에 따라 대표 메뉴인 고추바사삭 가격은 1만9900원으로 2만원에 육박했다. 저가 커피 프랜차이즈 업체인 더벤티는 지난 22일부터 카페라떼 등 음료 7종 가격을 200∼500원 올렸다. 다만, 소비자 부담을 고려해 아메리카노 가격은 동결했고 바닐라크림 콜드브루 등 음료 3종 가격은 100∼300원 인하했다.
‘배달-매장 이중가격제’ 도입으로 배달 메뉴를 시키면 가격이 더 비싼 곳도 있다. KFC도 지난달 19일 이중가격제를 도입했고, 배달 메뉴를 100∼800원 더 비싸게 판매하고 있다.
맥도날드는 다음 달 2일부터 16개 메뉴 가격을 평균 2.8% 올리기로 했다. 버거 단품 중 햄버거, 치즈버거, 더블 치즈버거, 트리플 치즈버거는 100원씩 올리고 불고기 버거는 300원, 에그 불고기 버거는 400원 각각 인상한다.
빅맥과 맥스파이시 상하이 버거 단품 가격은 동결되지만, 탄산음료와 사이드 메뉴 가격이 올라 세트 가격은 6900원에서 7200원으로 300원 오른다. 피자헛도 같은 날부터 갈릭버터쉬림프, 치즈킹 등 프리미엄 메뉴 가격을 올린다. 인상 폭은 추후 공지하기로 했다. 외식업체들은 재료비와 인건비 등 제반 비용 상승에 따라 메뉴 가격 인상이 불가피하다고 주장하고 있다.

Article: 롯데칠성음료는 대표 소주 ‘처음처럼’을 리뉴얼(새단장) 출시했다고 1일 밝혔다.
롯데칠성음료는 제조 공정을 업그레이드해 기존 제품보다 알코올 향을 줄여, 소비자들이 더 부드럽게 마실 수 있도록 리뉴얼 제품을 만들었다고 설명했다.
또 라벨에서는 ‘처음처럼’ 로고 크기를 더 키우고 중앙에 배치해 제품명을 강조했다. 로고 아래에는 처음처럼 수원지인 대관령 기슭의 자연을 상징적으로 표현한 수채화 디자인을 넣었다.
소주 본연의 맛과 향을 강조하기 위해 첨가한 국산 쌀, 보리 원료의 증류식 소주 등 소주의 풍미를 살리는 레시피와 알코올 도수는 16.5도로 기존과 동일하게 유지했다.
병 제품의 라벨에는 처음처럼 광고 모델인 배우 김지원, 구교환의 음성 메시지를 들을 수 있는 QR코드를 추가했다.
공익적 내용 등 다양한 버전으로 연출된 음성 메시지는 “내 목소리 듣고 설레는거야?”, “한 잔 비우면, 운전할 마음도 비우자!” 등과 같은 20여가지의 내용으로 구성되어 있다.
롯데칠성음료 관계자는 “기존 ‘처음처럼’과 같은 16.5도의 알코올 도수, 증류식 소주 첨가 등 소주 본연의 풍미를 위한 다양한 레시피는 그대로 유지한 채, 공정을 개선해 최근 트렌드에 맞는 부드러움을 구현했다”면서, “앞으로도 롯데칠성음료는 대표 소주 ‘처음처럼’과 제로 슈거 소주의 대표 주자 ‘새로’의 투 트랙(two track)전략을 통해 소비자들의 소주에 대한 다양한 니즈(needs)에 맞는 적극적인 마케팅을 지속할 계획”이라고 말했다.

Article: 수도권 교통혁명으로 기대받던 수도권 광역급행철도(GTX)가 개통 한 달을 넘긴 가운데 이용객이 당초 예상치의 절반에 미치지 못하는 것으로 나타났다. 핵심 정차역과 이어지지 못하는 ‘반쪽 개통’인 데다, 이용객이 몰리는 일부 역의 낮은 접근성 때문으로 보인다.
1일 국토교통부에 따르면 개통일인 지난 3월 30일부터 지난달 29일까지 31일간 GTX-A 수서∼동탄 구간 이용객은 26만3665명으로 집계됐다. 개통 전 국토부가 예측한 총수요 61만5128명의 42.9% 수준에 불과하다.
국토부는 당초 평일 2만1523명, 휴일 1만6788명이 이용할 것으로 예측했다.
지난 31일간 이용객은 평일 평균 7675명, 휴일 평균 1만16명으로 평일은 예측치의 35.7%, 휴일은 59.7% 수준이었다.
전문가들은 GTX-A의 전체 구간(운정∼동탄)이 개통하고 서울 주요 업무지구로 이어지는 서울역과 삼성역이 열리면 출퇴근 수요에 힘입어 이용자가 눈에 띄게 증가할 것으로 보고 있다.
GTX-A 운정∼서울역 구간은 오는 12월, 서울역∼수서 구간은 오는 2026년 말 개통 예정이다. 삼성역에는 복합환승센터가 완공되는 2028년이 돼서야 정차하게 된다.
하지만 삼성역 환승센터가 개통되도 A노선 수요가 늘긴 하겠지만, 현재의 3배까지 늘지는 낙관하기 쉽지 않다. 지하철과 달리 GTX는 강남 지역에선 수서·삼성역에서만 정차하기 때문에 환승 부담이 만만치 않다. 게다가 동탄역 등 GTX 역사 접근성이 떨어져 이용객들의 불만이 크다.
40대 직장인 김모씨는 “현재 집 근처에서 광역버스를 타고 근무지 지척까지 바로 이동하는 수도권의 상당수 통근자들에겐 GTX가 크게 매력적이지 않을 수 있다”고 했다.
김도경 서울시립대 교통공학과 교수는 “동탄역의 연계 교통수단이 좋지 못한 데다, 수서역에서 내려 강남 등 최종 목적지로 환승하기가 불편하기에 GTX-A를 선호하지 않는 듯하다”며 “일반 전철 등에 비해 상대적으로 요금이 비싼데 아직 이동시간은 크게 줄지 않기에 경쟁력이 부족하다고 느끼는 것”이라고 분석했다.
GTX-A 수서~동탄 구간 운행이 본격 시작되면서 D·E·F 노선을 둘러싼 ‘실효성 논란’도 일고 있다.
국토교통부에 따르면 제5차 국가철도망구축계획에 반영될 D노선은 김포·인천을 팔당·원주까지 잇는 노선이다. 수도권을 동서로 가로지르다 삼성역에서 양 끝이 Y자 형태로 갈라지는 모습으로 결정됐다. 그런데 서울 지하철 5호선 장기~불로~원당 구간과 노선이 중복된다. 또 인천공항~대장 구간은 E노선과 겹친다. 중복 투자 우려가 제기될 수 있는 부분이다.

황정아 대변인은 이날 서면 브리핑에서 "대한민국이 최빈국에서 세계 경제강국으로 도약하는 데는 노동자들의 땀과 눈물이 있었다"며 "그 노고와 헌신에 존경과 감사의 말씀을 드린다"고 말했다.
황 대변인은 "윤석열 정부는 대한민국의 도약을 이끌어 온 노동자들의 자부심을 무너뜨리고 있다"며 "반노동 정책으로 노동의 시계를 거꾸로 되돌리고 있다"고 지적했다.

Article: O responsável do Escritório das Nações Unidas para a Coordenação de Assuntos Humanitários (OCHA), Martin Griffiths, disse, nesta terça-feira (30), que uma ofensiva terrestre israelense na cidade de Rafah, no sul da Faixa de Gaza, seria uma "tragédia indescritível".
"A verdade é que uma operação em Rafah não será nada menos que uma tragédia indescritível. Nenhum plano humanitário pode se contrapor a isso", disse Griffiths depois que o primeiro-ministro israelense, Benjamin Netanyahu, prometeu lançar uma ofensiva sobre essa cidade, onde 1,5 milhão de palestinos estão refugiados.
Enquanto o Hamas analisava o plano de trégua proposto nas conversas no Egito com mediadores americanos, egípcios e cataris, Netanyahu prometeu atacar Rafah "com ou sem acordo".
Washington se uniu aos chamados de vários países e organizações humanitárias para que Israel se abstenha de atacar a cidade diante do temor de que isso resulte em um massacre de civis.
"Para as agências que lutam para oferecer ajuda humanitária apesar das hostilidades, das estradas intransitáveis, das munições sem detonar, da escassez de combustível, dos atrasos nos postos de controle e das restrições israelenses, uma invasão terrestre seria um golpe desastroso", disse Griffiths.
"Estamos em uma corrida para evitar a fome e a morte, e estamos perdendo", advertiu.
A guerra na Faixa de Gaza começou após o ataque do Hamas em 7 de outubro de 2023 no sul de Israel, no qual comandos do movimento islamista mataram 1.170 pessoas, a maioria civis, e sequestraram por volta de 250, segundo uma estimativa da AFP baseada em dados oficiais israelenses.
Em represália, Israel lançou uma ofensiva contra o Hamas que já deixou 34.535 mortos, principalmente civis, segundo o Ministério da Saúde do território, governado pelo movimento islamista desde 2007.

Article: Temporais matam ao menos 5 pessoas no RS; Leite pede ajuda a Lula
Governador e presidente conversam sobre envio de forças de resgate
Os temporais que castigam o Rio Grande do Sul desde esta segunda-feira, 29, já causaram estragos em mais de 70 municípios. Autoridades já reportaram a morte de cinco pessoas e algumas dezenas estão feridas ou desaparecidas. O estado vem sofrendo com ciclos cada vez mais recorrentes de intempéries climáticas. Nesta terça, 30, o presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva prometeu envio de ajuda do governo federal para o estado.
Em postagem nas redes sociais, Lula disse que falou com o governador por telefone e determinou aos ministérios da Integração e Desenvolvimento Regional, da Defesa e da Comunicação Social que atuem no estado. “[O] governo federal irá se somar aos esforços do governo estadual e prefeituras para atravessarmos e superarmos mais esse momento difícil, reflexos das mudanças climáticas que afetam o planeta”, escreveu.
Em uma série de postagens, também nas redes sociais, o governador Eduardo Leite fez um apelo pelo envio de ajuda, principalmente apoio aéreo. “Precisamos resgatar já centenas de pessoas em dezenas de municípios que estão em situação de emergência pelas chuvas intensas já ocorridas e que vão continuar nos próximos dias”, escreveu Leite. “Falei agora por telefone com o presidente Lula, que assegurou o apoio do governo federal. Tenho certeza [de] que poderemos contar com essa união de esforços para o resgate da população afetada, que é a nossa prioridade absoluta neste momento”, postou em seguida.
No segundo semestre do ano passado, enchentes provocadas por fortes chuvas fizeram transbordar o Rio Taquari, em uma das piores cheias em décadas e deixaram um rastro de destruição, perdas materiais e cerca de 50 mortes.

Article: Festival literário em Petrópolis começa inovando na forma e na diversidade
Trata-se do primeiro evento do tipo na cidade imperial e terá a presença do presidente do STF, Luís Roberto Barroso, na abertura
O Festival Literário de Petrópolis, o Flipetrólis, que começa nesta quarta-feira, 1º, apresentará algumas das mais representativas figuras na literatura contemporânea hoje no Brasil. E do exterior, trará ninguém menos que a escritora franco ruandesa Scholastique Mukasonga, que está com livro novo. Primeiro evento do tipo na cidade imperial, tendo o luxo de ter a livraria dentro do Palácio de Cristal, ele será completamente igualitário em termos de gênero e cor, se considerados os escritores palestrantes.
Aliás, coloca o Brasil onde deve estar, longe da violência do tempo do império contra diversos tipos de raças e gêneros. A FliPetropólis trará ao leitor a literatura de indígenas, pretos, brancos, homens e mulheres.
Na mesma linha de outros festivais realizados pelo grupo de Afonso Borges, como a Fliaraxá, a Fliparacatu e Flitabira, o festival de Petrópolis se propõe a criar um vínculo com a comunidade local. No caso da FliPetropólis, a expectativa é maior porque é uma cidade próxima de uma grande capital, o Rio de Janeiro. A abertura do evento, terá o presidente do Supremo Tribunal Federal, Luís Roberto Barroso.
O festival ainda terá uma cooperação direta e estreita com as escolas da cidade, seja para levar os alunos às livrarias, seja para as exposições, mesas dos autores de livros infantis e juvenis. Isso, além de promover um concurso de redação, que tem ajudado a formar leitores e escritores.
Confira abaixo entrevista com promotor cultural Afonso Borges, sobre a FliPetropólis.
O que mais impressiona nos festivais literários organizados por vocês é, em primeiro lugar, a diversidade dos escritores. Indígenas, homem, mulher, branco, preto e com composições de mesas realmente mistas. Você poderia comentar os nomes desse festival em Petrópolis?
Afonso Borges – Sim, Matheus, nós estamos propondo uma coisa diferente através dos festivais. Eu falo na terceira pessoa porque isso é obra de Sérgio Abranches e Tom Farias, curadores, além de mim. Os festivais que faço, além do Flipetrópolis, Fliaraxá, Fliparacatu e Flitabira são acessíveis, inclusivos, antirracistos, éticos, educativos, artísticos, carregados de conceito e conteúdo. Todas as sessões, sem exceção, são gratuitas e abertas ao público. E os nomes escolhidos trazem, em suas obras, esta nova mentalidade que está, finalmente, sendo difundida no Brasil. São eles: Ana Maria Machado, Aílton Krenak André Diaz, André Trigueiro, Andréa Pachá, Antônio Torres, Aydano André Motta, Bruna Lombardi, Bianca Santana, Carla Camurati, Carla Madeira, Cármen Lúcia, Chico Otavio, Conceição Evaristo, Cris Olivieri, Edney Silvestre, Eliana Alves Cruz, Estevão Ribeiro, Frei Betto, Gustavo Grandinetti, Itamar Vieira Junior, Jamil Chade, João Candido Portinari, Jeferson Tenório, Joana Silva, Leandro Garcia, Leonardo Boff, Lívia Sant’Anna Vaz, Lucia Riff, Luís Roberto Barroso, Luiz Galina, Maria Edina Portinari, Maria Ribeiro, Matheus Leitão, Miriam Leitão, Morgana Kretzmann, Paloma Jorge Amado, Paula Pimenta, Patrícia Espírito Santo, Paulo Scott, Ricardo Ramos Filho, Rodrigo Santos, Rosiska Darcy de Oliveira, Scholastique Mukasonga, Sérgio Abranches, Silvana Gontijo, Simone Paulino, Taiane Santi Martins, Thiago Lacerda, Tino Freitas, Tom Farias, Trudruá Dorrico e Ynaê Lopes dos Santos.
A outra questão diferente de tudo o que se viu é um espaço de troca – de conversa entre autores e os seus leitores. Como você, Afonso, tem testemunhado isso?
Afonso Borges – Eu considero esta proposta de “conversas” como uma nova aposta. Os convites para eventos como este são sempre pautados por um tema, um título, uma orientação. Desta vez, a pauta conterá a surpresa que os bons encontros proporcionam. Os autores vão falar de sua obra, de seu trabalho, de suas vidas com uma mediação. Vai ser uma maravilha! E sempre com a diversidade na pauta: um negro com um branco, ou branca, ou indígena. Tudo misturado.
O concurso de redação que se transformou na menina dos olhos do festival – porque é por ele, por meio dele, que se incentiva as crianças a lerem e a escreverem. E as escolas se mobilizam mesmo. Disputam, tem torcida organizada, comemoram os prêmios. É o momento emocionante desses festivais comandados por você ao redor do país?
Afonso Borges – Sem dúvida nenhuma. Os prêmios em dinheiro são um ponto de atração, mas o mais importante é a participação efetiva dos professores. As redações são feitas em sala de aula e as próprias escolas que escolhem as melhores. Depois, o resultado passa pelo crivo dos jurados. No final, os autores homenageados, no caso, Conceição Evaristo e Ana Maria Machado lêem a redação premiada. É uma coisa inesquecível para quem ganha. Passa a fazer parte da história daquela criança ou jovem. Em Araxá, onde estamos há 12 anos, uma geração já se formou com o Concurso. E os ganhadores hoje tem um lugar de destaque em seus ambientes profissionais.

Article: Equipe do plano de governo de Tabata reúne ex-integrantes do governo Lula
Leany Lemos vai coordenar o grupo de Finanças e José Francisco Manssur, especialista em apostas esportivas, a equipe de Esportes
A pré-candidata do PSB à prefeitura de São Paulo, Tabata Amaral, vai apresentar nesta quarta-feira os grupos de trabalho que vão elaborar seu plano de governo para a capital paulista. Entre os coordenadores, há dois ex-integrantes do governo Lula, Leany Lemos e José Francisco Manssur, que deixaram recentemente seus cargos na gestão federal.
A ex-secretária nacional de Planejamento, Leany Lemos, será a responsável pelo grupo de Finanças. Ela trabalhou junto com Simone Tebet até abril deste ano e a saída do Ministério do Planejamento já estava combinada com a ministra desde dezembro.
Com experiência na área nos governos do Distrito Federal e do Rio Grande do Sul, Lemos foi responsável por coordenar o Plano Plurianual Participativo, no primeiro ano do terceiro mandato de Lula.
Já José Francisco Manssur estava lotado no Ministério da Fazenda até fevereiro e, no programa de governo de Tabata, vai chefiar o grupo dos Esportes. Especialista em apostas esportivas, Manssur foi um dos principais responsáveis pela regulamentação das “bets”, aprovada no ano passado no Congresso.
O ex-assessor especial da Fazenda chegou a ser um dos nomes cotados para assumir a Secretaria de Prêmios e Apostas. O cargo foi preenchido na semana passada por Regis Anderson Dudena, ex-auxiliar de Dilma Rousseff.
Outros nomes na coordenação do programa de Tabata estão vinculados ao governo federal, em especial, ao vice-presidente Geraldo Alckmin. A responsável pelo programa de Habitação, Carmem Silva, é assessora do Ministério do Desenvolvimento, Indústria e Comércio.
Aliado de longa data de Alckmin, o ex-deputado Floriano Pesaro vai ser o responsável pela elaboração de políticas públicas para “Cracolândia e cenas de uso aberto de drogas”. Pesaro ocupa a diretoria de Gestão Corporativa da agência do governo federal de promoção de exportações, a ApexBrasil.
Outros nomes curiosos figuram entre os coordenadores dos grupos temáticos do plano de governo do PSB para a capital paulista, como a filha do ex-presidente Michel Temer, Luciana Temer, responsável pela área de Família, Desenvolvimento Social e Segurança Alimentar, e a mãe do apresentador Luciano Huck, Marta Grostein, reponsável pelo griupo de Desenvolvimento Urbano e Urbanismo Social.

Article: O que o futuro guarda para Eliana — segundo a versão original de Renascer
Dondoca interpretada por Sophie Charlotte dá a volta por cima após ser expulsa da fazenda de José Inocêncio
Em Renascer, a vida de Eliana (Sophie Charlotte) sofre uma grande reviravolta após ela ser expulsa da fazenda de cacau do ex-sogro, José Inocêncio (Marcos Palmeira). Na versão original da novela, escrita por Benedito Ruy Barbosa e exibida em 1993, a dondoca fica na miséria depois de descobrir que não tem direito às terras de José Venâncio (Rodrigo Simas), assassinado em uma emboscada. O publicitário foi casado com Eliana em regime de comunhão parcial de bens e morreu antes de finalizar o divórcio. A moça não pôde ficar com o espólio do ex-marido, que herdou as terras da mãe, Maria Santa (Duda Santos), antes do casamento.
Sem ter para onde ir, a personagem é acolhida por Sandra (Giullia Buscacio), filha do coronel Egídio (Vladmir Brichta) que vive afastada do pai na casa da falecida cafetina Jacutinga (Juliana Paes). Juntas, as colegas transformam o antigo bordel em uma casa de forró, seguindo a sugestão de Rachid (Almir Sater), proprietário do imóvel.
Quando Egídio é abandonado pela mulher Iolanda (Camila Morgado), a “dona patroa”, Eliana aproveita para flertar com o coronel. Astuta, a moça logo se casa com o rival de José Inocêncio e passa a morar em sua fazenda. Apesar do novo matrimônio, ela não abre mão do romance com o jagunço Damião (Xamã).
Na reta final da trama, Egídio é assassinado por Mariana (Theresa Fonseca) e deixa sua fortuna para a esposa. Viúva pela segunda vez, Eliana assume as terras do ex-marido e termina a novela casada com Damião, com quem tem um filho. Se o roteiro do remake — assinado por Bruno Luperi, neto de Benedito Ruy Barbosa — não for alterado, o destino da dondoca na novela das nove será o mesmo.

Article: Haddad acena a Lira e Pacheco e agradece por restrições ao Perse
Ministro citou nominalmente os presidentes da Câmara e do Senado pelo trabalho na aprovação do programa voltado ao setor de eventos
Em meio à crise entre o governo federal e o Congresso, o ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad, agradeceu nominalmente os presidentes da Câmara, Arthur Lira (PP-AL), e do Senado, Rodrigo Pacheco (PSD-MG), pela aprovação de novas regras e do teto de 15 bilhões de reais ao projeto que prorroga o Programa Emergencial de Retomada do Setor de Eventos (Perse). O PL passou pela Câmara na semana passada e pelo Senado nesta terça — agora, segue para a sanção presidencial.
“Quero agradecer mais uma vez à Câmara e ao Senado pelo fato de terem aprovado essa restrição que foi feita ao Perse, com regras que filtram o programa, estabelecem uma governança e o colocam dentro do Orçamento”, afirmou Haddad a jornalistas em São Paulo. “A Câmara e o Senado — e eu agradeço tanto ao Arthur Lira quanto o Rodrigo Pacheco — disciplinaram e moralizaram um programa que estava dando muito problema não por culpa do Congresso, mas porque o desenho permitia que ele fosse burlado. E isso foi definitivamente corrigido.”
A relatora do PL no Senado, Daniella Ribeiro (PSD-PB), chegou a incluir em seu parecer um dispositivo que corrigiria pela inflação os 15 bilhões de reais do Perse — isso aumentaria o custo do projeto em cerca de 2 bilhões de reais. Após pedido do setor de eventos e negociação com o governo, ela retirou esse trecho e manteve o texto aprovado pela Câmara.
Desoneração da folha
Haddad também falou sobre a judicialização do caso da desoneração da folha de pagamento de empresas de 17 setores e municípios com até 156 mil habitantes. O pedido do governo no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) para derrubar a prorrogação do benefício, aprovada pelo Congresso no ano passado, intensificou a crise com o Legislativo.
“O governo não tem dificuldade de relacionamento com as duas Casas, muito pelo contrário”, disse o ministro. “Há atos vinculantes. Um parecer da Advocacia Geral da União, da Procuradoria Geral da Fazenda Nacional, sugerindo a inconstitucionalidade do ato, ela vincula o poder executivo. Amanhã você pode responder por omissão, por irresponsabilidade fiscal. Você não tem a liberdade que as pessoas imaginam. Esses pareceres são do governo anterior, inclusive. Nem foram elaborados por esse governo. Nós estamos vinculados a pareceres sólidos sobre essa matéria, e nós não podemos pecar por omissão, sob pena de responsabilização.”
Mais cedo, Pacheco classificou como “erro primário” o pedido da AGU no STF, mas contemporizou dizendo que “qualquer divergência que há na política é algo completamente natural”. Uma liminar do ministro Cristiano Zanin, indicado pelo presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva à Corte, suspendeu trechos da desoneração. A decisão precisa ser referendada pelo plenário do STF, que já soma cinco votos favoráveis à sua manutenção. O julgamento foi interrompido por pedido de vista do ministro Luiz Fux. Na semana passada, Pacheco entrou com recurso contra o pedido do governo.

Article: Pacheco diz que governo errou com desoneração no STF, mas minimiza crise
AGU pediu ao STF derrubada da medida fiscal; ação está em julgamento
O presidente do Senado, Rodrigo Pacheco (PSD-MG), criticou nesta terça-feira (30) a judicialização, por parte do governo, de trechos da Lei 14.784, de 2023, que prorroga a desoneração da folha de pagamento de empresas e prefeituras até 2027. Segundo ele, o ajuizamento da ação no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) foi um erro primário do governo federal e gera uma crise de confiança na relação entre os Poderes.
“É inegável o direito que se tem de acessar a Justiça, é direito do cidadão e também de um poder. A questão que nós ponderamos apenas é que em um tema que está sendo discutido no ambiente da política, entre o Poder Executivo e o Poder Legislativo, estamos no meio dessa discussão política, haver a precipitação do ajuizamento de uma ação. Esse ponto atribuímos ser um erro do governo federal sob todos os aspectos”, disse Pacheco, em entrevista coletiva.
Pacheco, porém, também afirmou que divergência na política é algo “natural”. “Qualquer divergência que há na política é algo completamente natural, entre poderes, entre casas legislativas, entre pessoas que figuram nesses poderes, nessas instituições”, disse. “Mas jamais são conflitos que afetam o interesse público, a gente busca sempre a convergência, e essas divergências certamente são dirimidas, a cada dia a gente vai dirimindo uma a uma.”
Na semana passada, com base em uma ação da Advocacia-Geral da União (AGU), o ministro do STF Cristiano Zanin concedeu liminar suspendendo a desoneração da folha e submeteu sua decisão ao plenário. Cinco dos 11 ministros votaram por confirmar a suspensão, mas Luiz Fux pediu vista e interrompeu a análise. Ele tem até 90 dias para liberar o processo.
Em entrevista nessa segunda-feira, 29, o ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad, afirmou que a manutenção da desoneração da folha de pagamento para 17 setores da economia e da desoneração para pequenos municípios traz o risco de uma nova reforma da Previdência em três anos.
PEC do Quinquênio
Pacheco voltou a condicionar a votação da PEC do Quinquênio, que cria adicional sobre o salário de carreiras jurídicas, ao projeto que acaba com os supersalários no serviço público. Segundo ele, a economia para as contas públicas que seria gerada com o projeto de lei que combate os supersalários é superior ao incremento de gasto, dentro do Orçamento, para o pagamento do quinquênio, um bônus de 5% do salário a cada cinco anos a carreiras do Judiciário.
“As duas coisas casadas e em conjunto significam economia para o Estado brasileiro. Essa combinação do projeto de lei com a emenda não altera em nada nossa busca do cumprimento da meta fiscal”, disse.

Article: TSE pede mais provas em processo que pode cassar bolsonarista Jorge Seif
Senador é acusado de abuso de poder econômico na campanha de 2022
Por 6 votos a 1, o Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) decidiu nesta terça-feira, 30, ampliar a investigação no processo que pode cassar o mandato do senador bolsonarista Jorge Seif (PL-SC) por abuso de poder econômico na campanha de 2022.
O TSE iniciou o julgamento de um recurso protocolado pela Coligação Bora Trabalhar, formada pelo PSD, Patriota e União Brasil. Em novembro do ano passado, o Tribunal Regional Eleitoral (TRE) de Santa Catarina rejeitou as acusações contra Seif e manteve o mandato.
Para as legendas, Seif teve a candidatura beneficiada pelo empresário Luciano Hang, proprietário das lojas Havan. De acordo com o processo, foi ofertado ao senador estrutura para realização de viagens em aeronaves da empresa e transmissões nas redes sociais (lives), além do envolvimento pessoal de Hang na campanha.
Os partidos também apontam o suposto financiamento irregular da campanha por meio da participação do senador em uma feira promovida pelo Sindicato de Indústrias de Calçados de São João Batista (SC).
O uso de um helicóptero cedido pelo empresário Osni Cipriani para deslocamentos aos eventos da campanha também foi citado.
Ao analisar o caso, o ministro Floriano de Azevedo Marques, relator do recurso, determinou que a Havan informe, no prazo de 24 horas, os prefixos de suas aeronaves. Aeroportos de Santa Catarina também deverão enviar ao TSE dados sobre pousos de aviões da empresa e a lista de passageiros. Em caso de descumprimento, será cobrada multa de R$ 20 mil.
O voto foi acompanhando pelos ministros André Ramos Tavares, Maria Isabel Galotti, Cármen Lúcia, Nunes Marques e o presidente, Alexandre de Moraes. Raul Araújo foi contra por entender que a investigação do caso não pode ser reaberta.
Defesa
No dia 4 de abril, primeiro dia do julgamento, a defesa do senador disse que não ficou provada a prática de abuso de poder econômico e de participação expressiva de Hang na campanha do candidato.
“A prova que se pretendeu produzir veio negativa. Mas a narrativa segue, e é quase uma desinformação processual”, disse a advogada Maria Claudia Bucchianeri.

Article: Em 2002, Elon Musk decidiu fundar a SpaceX, uma empresa aeroespacial dedicada a várias inovações, como a reutilização de foguetes. Assim, ao longo das últimas duas décadas, a empresa, cujo nome completo é Space Exploration Technologies Corp., conseguiu se posicionar na vanguarda da exploração espacial, com sua nave Starship projetada para missões à Lua e a Marte, e com acordos já assinados para o futuro com a NASA e a Estação Espacial Internacional.
ANÚNCIO
Agora, num evento sem precedentes em 146 lançamentos, a SpaceX decidiu deliberadamente estrelar um de seus foguetes Falcon 9 no oceano. Claramente, este acontecimento marcou uma nova fase nas operações da empresa, e aqui explicamos porquê.
A SpaceX chocou um dos seus foguetes Falcon 9
Vamos começar pelo princípio. Os foguetes modelo Falcon 9 são uma das maiores inovações da SpaceX, pois são o primeiro foguete orbital parcialmente reutilizável do mundo. Eles fizeram sua estreia em junho de 2010 e desde então têm marcado uma mudança na forma como os lançamentos espaciais são concebidos, oferecendo uma maneira mais econômica e eficiente de acessar o espaço. Graças a isso, os Falcon 9 têm sido fundamentais para transportar satélites para a órbita, abastecer a Estação Espacial Internacional e facilitar missões interplanetárias.

Agora vamos falar sobre o recente sacrifício. Em 28 de abril, um Falcon 9 decolou às 0:34 UTC, levando a bordo dois satélites Galileo destinados a operar em uma órbita média de 23.220 km de altura. Devido às demandas energéticas para alcançar esta órbita, a primeira etapa do foguete não tinha combustível suficiente para realizar um pouso controlado após a separação da segunda etapa, o que levou ao seu descarte programado no mar.
A etapa B1060 do Falcon 9, que foi sacrificada nesta missão, tinha um histórico impressionante. Já havia decolado 20 vezes no total, igualando o recorde de voos para um único foguete da SpaceX. Durante sua carreira, também lançou 228 toneladas de carga para a órbita e além, incluindo missões importantes como a Intuitive Machines IM-1 lunar e vários lançamentos de satélites Starlink.
No entanto, apesar de a reutilização de foguetes ser a motivação da SpaceX, o que permitiu à empresa aterrar foguetes até 300 vezes, esta missão exigiu um sacrifício necessário para garantir o sucesso no lançamento de dois satélites Galileo de navegação para a Comissão Europeia, a versão europeia do sistema GPS.

Article: Inauguração aconteceu nesta terça-feira (30); relembre o histórico do equipamento público

A Prefeitura de Cotia inaugurou, nesta terça-feira (30), a piscina semiolímpica do Centro Educacional de Caucaia do Alto (CEUC). O projeto foi batizado de ‘Acqua Social’ e oferecerá aulas de natação para crianças de 8 a adolescentes de 16 anos.
Segundo a prefeitura, em breve o projeto será ampliado com hidroginástica para pessoas idosas.
As aulas, de acordo com a administração municipal, acontecerão em duas piscinas e serão comandadas por professores de Educação Física e acompanhadas por salva-vidas. Os jovens inscritos receberão roupa de banho (maiô e sunga), touca, óculos e roupão.
A inauguração do projeto contou com a presença do prefeito Rogério Franco, da vice-prefeita Ângela Maluf, da secretária de Desenvolvimento Social e primeira-dama, Mara Franco, além de vereadores e outros secretários municipais.
REQUISITOS PARA INSCRIÇÕES
Para se inscrever no projeto, é necessário:
- Estar inscrito, preferencialmente, no Cadastro Único;
- ter Número de Identificação Social (NIS) atualizado pelo CRAS;
- ter renda mensal familiar comprovada de até três salários mínimo;
- morar em Cotia há pelo menos um ano;
- ser estudante do município de Cotia (rede municipal e estadual);
- apresentar declaração escolar ativa;
- ter idade entre oito e 16 anos;
- apresentar RG/CPF do responsável e do interessado;
- apresentar atestado médico e uma foto 3x4.
DEPOIS DE 12 ANOS E REFORMAS DE MEIO MILHÃO
Pronta desde meados de 2012, a piscina semiolímpica com mais de 400 metros quadrados do CEUC foi utilizada uma única vez por funcionários públicos durante uma confraternização de final de ano, em 2014 [RELEMBRE AQUI].
Em julho de 2019, a piscina passou por uma reforma ampla e completa. A empresa Marol foi contratada para o serviço. O valor do contrato foi de R$ 399,9 mil.
Depois, em setembro de 2023, o equipamento público passou por novos reparos. A Prefeitura de Cotia fechou um contrato no valor de R$107,8 mil com uma empresa de São Paulo para realizar os serviços.
Os dois contratos, em 4 anos, somam, juntos, R$ 507,7 mil.
O QUE DIZ A PREFEITURA
Na ocasião, a Prefeitura disse ao Cotia e Cia que, durante este trabalho, a empresa corrigiu todas as falhas, trocou equipamentos e deixou a piscina apta para ser usada. Ressaltou, no entanto, que por mais que o equipamento público estivesse apto para o uso, ele dependia de uma nova licitação.
A prefeitura explicou que havia um projeto de instalação de um serviço público no local para oferecer atividades relacionadas ao uso da piscina para a população, mas em função da pandemia de Covid-19, a abertura da licitação foi suspensa.

Article: O mercado mais forte para Elon Musk e sua Tesla Motors é a China. O gigante asiático tem seus próprios carros elétricos e não é qualquer um que pode vender sua marca sem a autorização do governo. Embora já estejam sendo comercializados há algum tempo, havia um ponto a ser resolvido: a autorização do software de direção automática.
ANÚNCIO
Tudo isso parece ter sido resolvido com uma breve visita de Elon Musk à China. O CEO da Tesla, SpaceX, X e muitas outras empresas, assumiu a situação em suas mãos e conquistou três importantes vitórias, apenas se apresentando pessoalmente.
As vitórias de Elon Musk com sua visita à China
Elon Musk encontrou-se com o primeiro-ministro da China, Li Qiang. Na reunião, obteve a aprovação para a introdução do software de condução totalmente autônoma (FSD), necessário para que os veículos da Tesla Motors possam operar no país e transferir dados para o exterior.

2.- Como reação em cadeia, essa reunião e acordo alcançado fizeram com que as ações da Tesla Motors subissem 18%, de acordo com informações citadas pela La Tercera. Este ano, a empresa de carros elétricos de Elon Musk vinha registrando prejuízos e pela primeira vez desfrutam de um aumento, o qual é necessário para crescer nos mercados internacionais.
A terceira vitória de Elon Musk, que não é a menos importante de todas, é que ele conseguiu um acordo com a famosa cadeia de internet e principal motor de busca na rede da China, Baidu, que é como o Google de lá. Para que isso lhe serve? A Tesla Motors poderá usar a licença de mapeamento para coletar dados nas estradas públicas do gigante asiático.
Elon Musk tem vindo a trabalhar há algum tempo para alcançar este tipo de acordos na China, que sem dúvida poderia ser o seu melhor mercado devido ao avanço dos carros elétricos nesta região.

A loucura que ela fez
Anne Hathaway revelou a divertida anedota de quando tentou conhecer Ricky Martin quando tinha 16 anos e estava começando sua carreira como atriz.
A atriz, que na época não era tão popular, foi convidada para um ensaio do Billboard Music Awards e, quando viu o cantor, ficou chocada e disse “oh meu Deus, é o Ricky Martin”.
Nesse momento, um produtor a ouviu e disse que se ela queria conhecê-lo, e ela disse "posso?", mas Ricky estava prestes a sair.
Diante disso, o produtor deu a ideia de que ela corresse atrás dele, e Anne seguiu o conselho, então começou a perseguir Ricky, mas o cantor se assustou e acabou correndo e fugindo dela, e ela foi rotulada como perseguidora.
Na verdade, a equipe do evento chamou a atenção da agora famosa atriz, e no final ela não conseguiu conhecer Ricky Martin, e até tentou se desculpar e se sentiu mal e envergonhada pelo que fez, mas agora ela lembra disso com risos e como uma divertida anedota.
Nas redes sociais, tem causado risadas e afirmam que todas fariam o mesmo se vissem o cantor para poder conhecê-lo, além disso, esperam que se conheçam em breve.

Article: Assim como existem colorações que nos favorecem muito bem, existem outros tons de mechas que não favorecem as morenas e é melhor evitá-los em 2024. Não apenas por uma questão de colorimetria, mas também porque estão saindo de moda, então é melhor nos refrescarmos com outras alternativas que nos façam parecer modernas, frescas e jovens.
ANÚNCIO
De acordo com os especialistas do Clara, a cor dos olhos, o estilo e a personalidade também são muito influentes na hora de tomar a decisão, por isso o mais importante é que te sintas confortável e não tenhas medo de gritar ao mundo que estás num processo de reinvenção.
Chocolate
É um tom lindo quando aplicado na raiz do cabelo, mas não em mechas, pois não criará o efeito tridimensional de uma juba suculenta e atraente, saudável e cheia de vida. É um tom rico e profundo que serve mais como neutro para brincar com luzes loiras ou mogno, muito mais vistosas.

Cinza
Sabemos que é o favorito de muitas mulheres que estão perto dos 40 e 50 anos, pois preferem esquecer os cabelos grisalhos e retoques constantes. No entanto, pertence aos tons de mechas que NÃO favorecem as morenas, pois fazem você parecer sem brilho e sem vida. Elas te dão uma aparência "neutra", que até pode te fazer parecer pálida.
Roxo e seus tons subjacentes
É uma cor de fantasia muito bonita, mas é melhor evitá-la porque não oferece contraste suficiente para parecer atraente e trazer luz ao seu rosto. A mesma fonte afirma que tons relacionados como “violeta, berinjela, ameixa ou púrpura” não realçam seus traços, sendo mais adequados para peles claras.
“Para as morenas, é melhor optar por tonalidades luminosas e menos saturadas como o lilás ou o lavanda”, se estiver muito motivada a dar esse passo.

Graças às maravilhas da tecnologia, agora é possível observar essas paisagens durante as 24 horas do dia.
ANÚNCIO
A NASA, em conjunto com a administração da Estação Espacial Internacional (ISS, sigla em inglês), desenvolveu um aplicativo que mostra um vídeo da Terra do espaço, graças a uma câmera instalada do lado de fora do laboratório orbital.
A aplicação chama-se ISS Live Now: Terra ao Vivo e pode ser baixada em qualquer celular ou tablet através da Google Play Store. É simplesmente impressionante. Além de mostrar uma visual única da Terra, também fornece um mapa de onde a ISS está passando, permitindo que identifiques a região do mundo por onde ela está transitando.

VÍDEO: Câmeras de posto registraram os últimos momentos de empresários achados mortos em carro
Na mesma descrição da aplicação na Google Play Store, eles informam que recentemente adicionaram o download de vídeos e o ISS Tour, que é executado com o Google Street View.
É um sinal de vídeo ao vivo que está ativo 24 horas por dia. Às vezes, perde o sinal e eles te avisam na tela. Também pode acontecer de você ver apenas uma parte da nave e tudo escuro. Isso significa que a ISS virou e a câmera está apontando para o espaço profundo.
"É um bom aplicativo para saber a hora em que a ISS passará sobre nossa localização, e desde que o céu esteja limpo e as condições meteorológicas permitam, pode ser vista a olho nu, é uma boa experiência, especialmente para aqueles que vivem longe dos centros urbanos, onde não há tanta iluminação artificial e permite uma visão plena. Às vezes, ao salvar um vídeo, a reprodução congela e não é salva completamente, de resto, tudo bem", comentou Jorge Armando Rodríguez em uma avaliação do aplicativo.
"Olá, eu realmente recomendo de todo o coração este aplicativo. Ontem, explorando as funções deste app, encontrei o radar e pude verificar que meu dispositivo celular se sincroniza com o satélite. É uma pena que as câmeras não tenham tanta resolução, mas eu recomendo amplamente", disse Gilberto Giannini, outro dos usuários que fez sua avaliação.

Article: Uma mulher, de 31 anos de idade, usou o Reddit para desabafar sobre a ação do namorado, 36, em dar carona a uma senhora na estrada. Embora tivesse explicado sua preocupação, a dupla entrou em um conflito. O relato foi compartilhado no Reddit, por meio do usuário u/cherb30.
ANÚNCIO
“Depois da missa, paramos em um posto de gasolina a menos de um minuto de onde moramos. Estávamos meu namorado, minha filha de 14 meses e eu no carro. Eu estava ao telefone e de repente [meu namorado] abriu a porta do banco de trás para deixar uma senhora de meia idade (talvez 60 anos?) entrar com suas sacolas de compras. Aparentemente, ela pedia carona às pessoas para casa”, iniciou o texto na rede social.
“No caminho, eles conversaram e ele até apontou onde moramos, o que me preocupou muito. Ela morava bem longe do posto de gasolina e fiquei surpresa ter dito que caminhou até lá, achei que não ficava a mais de cinco minutos de distância”, continuou.

Insatisfação manifestada
No relato, a mulher revelou ter ficado muito chateada por ter deixado uma pessoa “estranha” entrar no banco de trás com a filha do lado. Apesar de ter se revelado uma senhora simpática, a moça alegou não saber da real intenção de desconhecidos.
“Disse ao [meu namorado] que gostaria que ele pudesse pelo menos tê-la sentado na frente para que ela não estivesse perto de nosso bebê, ou nos deixasse em casa primeiro e depois voltasse para buscá-la (isso levaria 3 minutos para fazer)”, desabafou.
“Eu trouxe isso para o meu namorado. Ele ficou muito bravo comigo por ‘ser diferente de Cristo’ e me chamou de pessoa de merd* que vive com medo. Sinceramente, sou exatamente o oposto e geralmente confio bastante nas pessoas, mas não quando se trata de minha filha”, continuou a mulher.
Ao finalizar o texto, a mulher disse ter se sentido culpada pela situação. No entanto, justificou sua atitude.
“Simplesmente tive um instinto de mãe para proteger minha filha. Tudo isso levou a uma grande discussão entre nós”, finalizou.

Article: Na última hora, Haddad impede injeção de R$ 2 bilhões no Perse
Pode-se acusar Fernando Haddad de muita coisa, exceto de falta de persistência. Mesmo quando é forçado a voltar atrás, empenha-se para obter um final menos pior. O ministro da Fazenda não conseguiu enterrar o Perse, programa criado em 2021, no auge da Pandemia, para socorrer o setor de eventos. Mas atenuou os danos.
O panelão do Perse serve às empresas beneficiadas isenção de quatro tributos federais: IRPJ, CSLL, PIS e Cofins. Na Câmara, Haddad negociou uma trava. O limite da isenção será o ano de 2026 ou a cifra de R$ 15 bilhões, o que vier primeiro. Quando se imaginava que o prato estivesse pronto, surgiu no Senado um aditivo.
Relatora da proposta, a senadora Daniella Ribeiro adicionou à mistura uma correção pela inflação. Algo que elevaria o gasto em algo como R$ 2 bilhões. Articulador de si mesmo, Haddad trocou um dedo de prosa com Daniella. A senadora recuou, restabelecendo o texto da Câmara. A coisa foi aprovada na noite desta terça-feira, em votação simbólica. A matéria vai à sanção de Lula.
Na versão original, o Perse isentava de tributos empresas de 44 setores com algum tipo de ligação com eventos. Privava o Tesouro de uma coleta anual de cerca de R$ 13 bilhões. Sem uma correção de rumos, seriam drenados R$ 39 bilhões até 2026.
A Fazenda tentou limitar a isenção a 12 setores. Premido pelo risco da derrota, o governo absorveu 30. Isso inclui de hotéis a parques de diversões, de casas de espetáculos a cinemas, de bares a restaurantes, de produtoras de artes cênicas e espetáculos musicais a filmagem de festas.
Antes, as empresas usufruíam automaticamente da isenção. Farejou-se na Fazenda um ninho de fraudes e de lavagem de dinheiro de má origem. Agora, as empresas precisarão se habilitar junto à Receita Federal, que produzirá relatórios bimestrais listando os beneficiários e os valores do refresco tributário.
Aceitar o menor dos males é ainda escolher mal. Sem a persistência de Haddad, entretanto, os males viriam para pior.

Article: A defesa da família de Raul Pelegrin, 41, preso cortar a corda de um trabalhador que estava pendurado na fachada de um prédio em Curitiba, afirmou que o empresário foi espancado na prisão um dia antes de morrer em um hospital de Piraquara, na região metropolitana da cidade.
O que aconteceu
Histórico de prontuário de Raul na prisão descreve o ocorrido. No documento, obtido pelo UOL, é descrito que, por volta das 12h30 do dia 3 de abril, presos relataram que o empresário estava apanhando de colegas em uma cela na Casa de Custódia de Piraquara. O preso foi retirado do local, encaminhado para a enfermaria e, após avaliação, foi levado para a UPA (Unidade de Pronto Atendimento) de Piraquara.
Registro indica que Raul voltou para a unidade prisional horas depois, no início da noite do dia 3, e foi transferido de cela. No dia seguinte (4 de abril), por volta das 15h30, Raul foi levado e ficou internado no Hospital Angelina Caron, na região metropolitana de Curitiba, após apresentar dificuldades respiratórias. A Polícia Penal do Paraná disse ao UOL que, por volta da 1h30 do dia 5, a Casa de Custódia foi informada sobre o óbito do homem na unidade de saúde, onde estava sob escolta policial.
Defesa da família afirma que preso foi "brutalmente espancado" e diz que setor da prisão negou acesso ao prontuário de Raul. De acordo com o advogado Adriano Bretas, após a recusa, o acesso ao documento foi pedido à Justiça, que aceitou a solicitação.
Bretas afirma que a agressão contra o cliente foi "escondida" da defesa e da família do preso. O advogado diz tomar todas as providências cabíveis e informou que um inquérito policial foi instaurado para apurar as circunstâncias da morte de Raul.
Raul morreu em decorrência de pneumonia e sepse (infecção generalizada), segundo a defesa dele. Após a morte do preso, a defesa explicou ao UOL que também desconhecia a internação do cliente no dia 4 de abril. Os advogados alegam que estiveram com Raul na unidade prisional pouco antes da segunda internação e, posteriormente, se reuniram com o diretor da prisão para falarem sobre a gravidade do estado de saúde do cliente, que aparentava estar muito debilitado na ocasião.
A defesa também comunicou que acionará diferentes órgãos para o esclarecimento das circunstâncias da morte. Entre eles: comissão de direitos humanos da Assembleia Legislativa do Estado do Paraná, o Ministério Público, o Poder Judiciário e a SESP-PR (Secretaria de Estado da Segurança Pública do Paraná).
Agressão a Raul é investigada
Depen (Departamento de Polícia Penal do Estado do Paraná) diz que caso está sob investigação das autoridades competentes. Eles informaram que a Corregedoria Geral, responsável pelo procedimento administrativo de apuração do caso, recentemente comunicou sobre a "suposta" ocorrência de agressão contra o preso.
Conselho Administrativo-Disciplinar da prisão onde Raul estava também "trabalha" para responsabilizar os autores das agressões. "Considerando tratar-se de fato ocorrido no interior de cela de custódia, local sem permanente visibilidade dos servidores, todas as pessoas privadas de liberdade recolhidas no ambiente em questão passam a compor as investigações e inquérito policial", informou a Polícia Penal em nota ao UOL.
A reportagem questionou, mas a Polícia Penal não respondeu se procedia à acusação da defesa de que a unidade prisional não avisou a família e os defensores de Raul sobre ele ter sido agredido e socorrido até uma unidade de saúde em 3 de abril.
Relembre o caso
O empresário Raul Pelegrin morreu no Hospital Angelina Caron, na região metropolitana de Curitiba, em 5 de abril. Ele foi preso em flagrante no dia 14 de março e teve a prisão convertida em preventiva (por tempo indeterminado), sendo transferido posteriormente à Casa de Custódia de Piraquara, onde estava desde o dia 27 de março.
Defensores citaram que o preso enfrentava problemas de dependência química havia alguns anos. Raul já teria sido internado compulsoriamente. A defesa pediu, mais de uma vez, a liberdade provisória do preso para interná-lo em uma clínica particular para tratamento especializado, mas as solicitações foram negadas pelo Tribunal de Justiça do Paraná.
O pedido da defesa para que o caso fosse corretamente tratado não com prisão, mas, sim, como um caso de doença que necessita de tratamento, perdeu seu efeito. Raul veio a falecer. Os fatos falam por si. Uma pessoa que era acusada de um crime tentado teve, na falta de sensibilidade, a sua sentença de morte.
Defensores de Raul Pelegrin, em nota ao UOL, no início de abril
Relembre o caso
O caso ocorreu no dia 14 de março. Raul Pelegrin, que residia na cobertura do prédio, no 27º andar, cortou a corda que sustentava o trabalhador que limpava a fachada do edifício. A vítima estava a 18 metros do chão e só não caiu do 6º andar devido ao funcionamento de um dispositivo de segurança que impediu a queda. O prédio fica localizado no bairro Água Verde, em Curitiba (PR).
A Polícia Militar foi acionada para a ocorrência e entrou no prédio com autorização do síndico. Os agentes checaram pelas câmeras de segurança que Raul estava dentro do apartamento e precisaram arrombar a porta da residência. No local, encontraram na sacada a faca que o homem de 41 anos utilizou e a corda cortada.
Além de Raul, a funcionária dele também foi presa por mentir para a polícia. Em nota, a Polícia Civil do Paraná explicou que ela teria dito aos agentes que o morador da cobertura não estaria dentro de casa. Ela foi ouvida e liberada em seguida.
Funcionários do condomínio disseram que já sofreram ameaças de Raul. O morador teria dito que iria cortar todas as cordas de todos os funcionários, caso não se retirassem. As informações constam no boletim de ocorrência.
Trabalhador que teve a corda cortada disse estar abalado e sentiu que ia morrer. "A gente não espera que isso possa acontecer. O sentimento é de tristeza. Poderia ter perdido minha vida ali, sem nem saber o motivo", disse Mayk Gustavo Ribeiro da Silva, 27, ao UOL no fim de março.

Article: A FAB (Força Aérea Brasileira) disponibilizou na noite desta terça-feira (30) dois helicópteros para auxiliar nos resgates dos atingidos pelas chuvas na região de Santa Maria, no Rio Grande do Sul. Os fortes temporais já deixaram cinco mortos, seis feridos e 18 desaparecidos no estado.
O que aconteceu
Helicópteros usados estão na Base Aérea de Santa Maria. Durante as ações de apoio, a FAB resgatou uma família que estava ilhada em uma residência cheia d'água, com risco de desabamento. Eles foram içados e transportados da região de Candelária até Santa Cruz.
Militares da FAB usam óculos de visão noturna em operação na noite desta terça. O equipamento é necessário em razão do horário e das condições meteorológicas no local.
Governador pede ajuda do presidente
Governador do Rio Grande do Sul, Eduardo Leite (PSDB), pediu que Lula (PT) envie "IMEDIATAMENTE" todo apoio aéreo possível ao estado. Na postagem, publicada na noite desta terça, o gestor diz ser necessário resgatar centenas de pessoas em municípios em situação de emergência pelas chuvas intensas.
Leite comentou que conversou com ministros e com o vice-presidente, Geraldo Alckmin (PSB), ao longo do dia e apoio foi encaminhado. Porém, ele declarou que o estado precisará de mais ajuda com "urgência".
Minutos depois do apelo, Lula publicou no X (antigo Twitter) que conversou com Leite. O presidente comunicou que colocou o Governo Federal à disposição do estado e que já conversou com ministros para que a gestão se some aos esforços do governo e das prefeituras. Lula ainda afirmou que este momento é "reflexos das mudanças climáticas que afetam o planeta".
Ao longo do dia tratei com os Ministros da Defesa, do Desenv. Regional. da SECOM e com o VP @geraldoalckmin. Apoio já foi encaminhado. Mas vamos precisar, com URGÊNCIA, de muito mais.

Chuvas no RS
Cinco pessoas morreram em razão das chuvas que atingem o estado. Delmar Wadomiro Sander, 69 anos, e Nelson Schaefer, 65 anos, morreram em decorrência das chuvas em Paverama (RS), informou a Defesa Civil. Ontem, os idosos tentavam atravessar de carro em uma área alagada quando o veículo foi levado pela correnteza. Um deles estava desaparecido até a manhã desta terça-feira (30). As outras mortes foram registradas nos municípios de Pântano Grande, Encantado e Santa Maria, mas as identidades das vítimas não foram divulgadas.
Quase 300 pessoas estão fora de casa até o início da noite desta terça-feira (30). 198 pessoas precisaram ficar em abrigos públicos, enquanto outras 95 estão desalojadas. Os desalojados são aqueles que saíram de suas residências e procuraram ajuda de parentes e amigos.
77 municípios foram afetados em todas as regiões do estado. Essas cidades reportaram vendavais, descargas elétricas, movimentos de massa, queda de granizo, alagamentos em áreas urbanas e transbordamento de córregos, arroios e rios, e interrupções de estradas. Os estragos foram registrados desde sábado (27) até esta terça-feira (30). As chuvas já afetaram 3.742 pessoas.
Defesa Civil orienta população a se prevenir. ''É importante que a população adote medidas preventivas como permanecer em casa, se puder, evitar atravessar áreas alagadas ou inundadas e procurar prestar auxílio a pessoas vulneráveis (idosos, pessoas doentes ou com dificuldade de mobilidade).''

Article: Erika de Souza Vieira Nunes, presa após ser flagrada com um idoso morto enquanto tentava sacar um empréstimo no Rio de Janeiro, também é investigada por homicídio culposo, quando não há intenção de matar.
O que aconteceu
A informação foi confirmada ao UOL pela advogada da suspeita, Ana Carla de Souza Corrêa.
O delegado Fábio Luiz da Silva Souza incluiu a nova tipificação de crime baseado em depoimentos de testemunhas e da própria Erika. Ela já era investigada por vilipêndio de cadáver e tentativa de furto mediante fraude.
A defesa rebateu o argumento do delegado. "Em nenhum momento Erika declarou ser cuidadora do senhor Paulo e nem exercia essa atividade. As testemunhas que relatam em sede policial dizem do cuidado que ela tinha pelo Sr. Paulo ao acompanhá-lo, não que ela era cuidadora".
Ana Carla também afirma que essas testemunhas " são pessoas completamente afastadas do vínculo familiar, sendo pessoas estranhas à relação familiar". A advogada diz que vai contestar formalmente a investigação por homicídio culposo.
Problemas psiquiátricos
Erika tinha problemas psiquiátricos e fazia uso abusivo de medicamentos controlados, diz filho. "Ela tomava medicamentos para dormir. Mas estava fazendo uso abusivo desses remédios e transitava entre realidade e alucinações", disse o bombeiro Lucas Nunes dos Santos, 27, filho de Erika, em entrevista ao UOL. O problema já havia sido relatado pela advogada Ana Carla de Souza, que a representa.
Mãe estava dopada e desorientada quando relatou por telefone a morte, ainda no banco, diz Lucas. "Ela ligou chorando e disse: 'meu tio faleceu, estamos no banco'. Mas não conseguia falar de forma coerente, parecia desorientada. Como ela estava dopada, não dava para entender direito", contou o filho de Erika ao citar a morte de Paulo Roberto Braga, 68.
Estado de saúde de Paulo teria piorado após internação. "Ele estava bem antes de ser internado. Minha mãe o visitou todos os dias. Depois, ele voltou debilitado. Foi algo bem repentino", disse Lucas. O idoso teve "pneumonia não especificada" dependente de oxigênio e ficou internado de 8 a 15 de abril na UPA de Bangu, indica o prontuário médico. Ele morreu um dia depois de ter alta hospitalar.

Article: Em julgamento de ação que pede a cassação do senador Jorge Seif (PL-SC), o TSE (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral) decidiu, por seis votos a um, que a investigação realizada não foi suficiente e que são necessárias mais informações para concluir o processo. Na prática, a decisão representa um retrocesso da ação para a fase de produção de provas, o que adia o julgamento do caso.
O que aconteceu
O relator entendeu que as informações obtidas até agora não são suficientes. Floriano de Azevedo Marques defendeu que sejam solicitadas informações à empresa Havan e aos aeroportos dos municípios do interior de Santa Catarina citados no processo.
A ação acusa Seif de abuso de poder econômico nas eleições de 2022. Ele teria se beneficiado da estrutura da rede de lojas Havan durante a campanha. A ação, movida pela chapa Bora Trabalhar (PSD, Patriota e União Brasil), pedia a cassação do mandato do parlamentar, um dos expoentes do bolsonarismo em Santa Catarina, e de seus dois suplentes.
A proposta foi submetida ao plenário, e apenas o ministro Raul Araújo votou contra. Com isso, o TSE deu 48h para que a Havan informe os prefixos de todas aeronaves da empresa de janeiro de 2022 a março de 2023. Estão incluídos na decisão todos os aviões com qualquer tipo de relação jurídica com a empresa (alugada, financiada etc) e que estivessem à disposição da empresa ou de seu dono, Luciano Hang, no período.
Em seguida, os aeroportos deverão informar os voos feitos por esses aviões e os passageiros transportados durante o período eleitoral. O TSE deu um prazo de 72h para o fornecimento desses dados.
O Ministério Público Eleitoral defendeu a cassação do parlamentar. Em manifestação no plenário do TSE, em 4 de abril, o MP Eleitoral entendeu que Seif usou de forma irregular o helicóptero da Havan para participar de diversos compromissos de campanha, na companhia de Hang.
O empresário colocou à disposição do candidato que apoiava toda a estrutura empresarial que, por óbvio, criou uma desigualdade fática evidente com relação aos demais candidatos.
Alexandre Espinosa, vice-procurador-geral eleitoral
A defesa de Seif, por sua vez, alegou que a ação não trazia provas das acusações.
Senador buscou interlocutores políticos junto ao tribunal. Um dos principais representantes do bolsonarismo e crítico de decisões de Moraes, Seif se mobilizou nos últimos dias junto a políticos para tentar convencer ministros do TSE de sua inocência e também baixou o tom de suas críticas ao Judiciário.
Em novembro, o Tribunal Regional Eleitoral de Santa Catarina julgou a ação improcedente. Diante disso, a coligação Bora Trabalhar recorreu ao TSE, a última instância da Justiça Eleitoral, em Brasília.
O caso envolvendo o senador é um dos principais na reta final da gestão de Alexandre de Moraes na presidência do tribunal. O ministro deixa o posto em 3 de junho deste ano. Sua gestão ficou marcada pelos duros embates com o bolsonarismo e lideranças bolsonaristas em meio a iniciativas de combate às fake news. A presidência da Corte deve ser assumida pela ministra Cármen Lúcia, do STF.

Article: A deputada alemã de extrema direita Beatrix von Storch publicou uma série de fotos, nesta terça-feira (30), no Instagram, ao lado do deputado federal brasileiro Eduardo Bolsonaro (PL).
O que aconteceu
Ela é neta de Johann Ludwig Schwerin von Krosigk, ministro das Finanças da ditadura nazista de Adolf Hitler por mais de 12 anos. Beatrix também é vice-líder do AfD, sigla de extrema direita, na Câmara alemã.
Beatrix von Storch chama Eduardo de "amigo". "Um amigo visitando a Câmara alemã. Eduardo Bolsonaro, nós, patriotas, defendemos juntos a democracia, a liberdade e o Estado de Direito".
O deputado brasileiro agradeceu. "Obrigado por todo o seu grande apoio à causa da democracia e da liberdade de expressão no Brasil. Deus abençoe você e Sven [marido da extremista]".
Eduardo Bolsonaro também fez uma publicação no Instagram com fotos ao lado da deputada e do marido dela. O deputado não cita o avô de Beatriz e escreve que "os tempos estranhos atuais no Brasil lembram o incêndio do Congresso alemão em 1933, que foi a desculpa usada por Hitler para perseguir seus opositores".
Em uma das fotos, Eduardo aparece ao lado de Sven segurando um vinho que leva o nome da família Bolsonaro.
Beatrix von Storch
Em julho de 2021, o então presidente Jair Bolsonaro também posou para uma foto ao lado de Beatrix von Storch. Em mensagem publicada nas redes sociais, a parlamentar agradeceu a Bolsonaro "pela amistosa recepção" e disse ter ficado impressionada com a "clara compreensão dos problemas da Europa e dos desafios políticos do nosso tempo" que ele mostrou.
O passado nazista da família de Beatrix passou a ser destacado pela imprensa alemã a partir de 2014, quando ela foi eleita deputada europeia pela AfD. Três anos depois, em 2017, ela foi eleita para o Bundestag (Parlamento alemão), representando Berlim.
Em 2016, ela manifestou aprovação a uma mensagem no Facebook que havia perguntado se guardas deveriam atirar em refugiados, inclusive mulheres com crianças.
Em 2018, ela voltou a causar controvérsia ao reclamar de tuítes da Polícia de Colônia que desejavam feliz ano novo em várias línguas, inclusive o árabe. "Eles pretendem apaziguar as hordas de homens bárbaros, muçulmanos e estupradores em massa dessa maneira?", escreveu. A rede social apagou a mensagem por violação das regras.
Dentro da AfD, a deputada costuma ser apontada como membro da ala "cristã ultraconservadora". Em 2014, quando os ultradireitistas tomaram o partido, ela afirmou que via a sigla como um veículo para "uma visão cristã da humanidade".
Quem foi o avô da deputada extremista
Como ministro das Finanças, Schwerin von Krosigk foi responsável por confiscar propriedades de judeus e explorar áreas conquistadas pela Alemanha nazista.
Após o suicídio de Hitler, em abril de 1945, ele foi ainda alçado ao posto de "ministro-chefe" (equivalente a chanceler). Schwerin assumiu o posto no efêmero governo do almirante Karl Dönitz, que havia assumido o cargo de presidente do que restava da Alemanha. O gabinete durou apenas alguns dias, e logo seus membros foram capturados por tropas britânicas.
Von Krosigk seria mais tarde julgado e condenado pelo Tribunal de Nuremberg, na etapa conhecida como o "julgamento dos ministros", entre 1948 e 1949. Ele foi sentenciado a dez anos de prisão por crimes de guerra, mas foi beneficiado por uma anistia em 1951. Em 1977, morreu.

Article: Um ataque russo com mísseis deixou pelo menos três mortos em Odessa, informou na manhã desta quarta-feira (noite de terça, 30, em Brasília) o prefeito desta cidade portuária do sudoeste da Ucrânia.
"O inimigo atacou Odessa com mísseis balísticos. Como consequência do ataque, três pessoas morreram e outras três ficaram feridas", indicou o prefeito da cidade, Gennadiy Trukhanov, no Telegram.
"Toda a ajuda médica necessária está sendo oferecida aos feridos", assegurou no Telegram o governador do oblast (província) de Odessa, Oleh Kiper.
"Há danos em infraestrutura civil", acrescentou Kiper, sem dar mais informações.
Outro ataque russo com mísseis lançado nas segunda-feira contra Odessa deixou cinco mortos, segundo as autoridades locais.
Odessa é uma cidade portuária às margens do Mar Negro, que é vital para as exportações ucranianas, e alvo frequente de ataques mortais com mísseis e drones.
Há meses a Rússia ataca as cidades ucranianas sem descanso e avança na frente oriental no país vizinho, antes da chegada da ajuda militar americana.

Article: Uma ativista pelos direitos das mulheres, detida há mais de dois anos na Arábia Saudita, foi condenada a 11 anos de prisão em janeiro passado por acusações relacionadas ao "terrorismo", denunciaram nesta terça-feira (30) duas ONGs de direitos humanos.
Manahel al Otaibi, de 29 anos, foi sentenciada em 9 de janeiro durante uma "audiência secreta", segundo a Anistia Internacional e a ALQST, ambas sediadas em Londres.
A condenação foi divulgada semanas depois "na resposta oficial do governo saudita a um pedido de informações feito pelos relatores especiais das Nações Unidas sobre seu caso", afirmaram as ONGs em comunicado conjunto.
"As acusações contra ela se referiam unicamente à sua escolha de vestimenta e à expressão de suas opiniões na internet, como o fato de ter pedido nas redes sociais o fim do sistema de tutela masculina na Arábia Saudita", indicou o texto.
Ela também foi processada "por publicar" vídeos em que aparece vestindo "roupas indecentes" e indo a "lojas sem abaya", um longo vestido tradicional que cobre todo o corpo.
A resposta saudita à ONU, datada de 24 de janeiro e consultada nesta terça-feira pela AFP, indica que Otaibi "foi condenada por crimes de terrorismo não relacionados ao exercício de sua liberdade de opinião e expressão ou com suas publicações nas redes sociais".
O documento não detalha quais são os "crimes de terrorismo" citados.
Consultado pela AFP, o governo saudita inicialmente não se pronunciou sobre o caso.

Article: Como é o projeto de reformas impulsionado pelo presidente argentino Javier Milei?
Aqui estão cinco áreas-chave contempladas no projeto de lei de desregulamentação da economia e no pacote fiscal, que ainda precisam ser aprovados pelo Senado após sua votação nesta terça-feira (30) pelos deputados.
- Poderes delegados -
O projeto conhecido como Lei de Bases declara emergência em matéria administrativa, econômica, financeira e energética por um ano e concede a Milei poderes para legislar nesses setores.
É um dos pontos mais controversos e foi motivo do naufrágio do projeto original em fevereiro. Depois ele retornou à Câmara dos Deputados com modificações.
A oposição afirma que, também em sua versão atual, implica conceder "a soma do poder público" ao Executivo e adverte que permitiria modificar ou eliminar as competências, funções e quantidade de funcionários de organismos descentralizados como o Conselho de Pesquisas Científicas (Conicet) e o Instituto de Cinema (Incaa), entre muitos outros.
"Busca-se delegar poder a quem evidentemente odeia o Estado", declarou a deputada peronista Blanca Osuna, enquanto os blocos próximos à situação apontaram que governos anteriores também receberam capacidades semelhantes.
- Privatizações -
O projeto autoriza o presidente a iniciar o processo de privatização de mais de uma dezena de empresas estatais, entre elas Aerolíneas Argentinas, Agua y Saneamientos e várias companhias de comunicações, transporte e energia.
Isso também inclui a privatização parcial da Nucleoeléctrica, responsável pelas usinas nucleares do país.
Em sua versão original, a lei contemplava a possibilidade de privatizar cerca de 40 empresas.
- Grandes investimentos -
O chamado "Regime de incentivo a grandes investimentos" (Rigi) que faz parte da norma busca promover a chegada de capitais estrangeiros com benefícios fiscais, aduaneiros e cambiais.
É outra medida que gerou polêmica em vários setores: membros da União Industrial Argentina apontaram que a medida exclui as pequenas e médias empresas e prejudica a indústria nacional, enquanto o Grupo de Ação Financeira Internacional (Gafi) indicou que o regime é "uma porta de entrada" para "capitais provenientes do tráfico de entorpecentes, armas e pessoas".
O deputado opositor, mas aliado do oficialismo, Miguel Pichetto, afirmou que "o Rigi é para exploração mineral, petrolífera e de gás, e esses são os investimentos que a Argentina precisa", ao mesmo tempo que chamou a "desmistificar este tema da entrega do patrimônio da soberania nacional".
- Reforma trabalhista e previdenciária -
A reforma trabalhista contida na lei estende o período de teste para novos funcionários de três para seis meses e até mesmo para um ano; perdoa multas a empresas com trabalhadores não registrados para incentivar sua formalização e propõe a implementação de um fundo de rescisão trabalhista que substitui o atual regime de indenizações.
Revoga a prestação de aposentadoria vigente e cria uma nova que estabelece que aqueles que não acumularem 30 anos de contribuições têm direito a uma pensão mínima, equivalente a 80% da aposentadoria mínima, a partir dos 65 anos.
- Pacote fiscal -
O pacote de reformas fiscais determina, entre outras medidas, que os assalariados com rendimentos superiores a 1,8 milhão de pesos (10.662 reais no câmbio oficial) voltem a pagar imposto de renda, um tributo que para essa parcela havia sido revogado em 2023 inclusive com o voto do então deputado Javier Milei.

Article: O presidente da Colômbia, Gustavo Petro, denunciou nesta terça-feira (30) o "grave" desaparecimento de "mais de um milhão" de armas e munições de duas bases militares, atribuindo o fato a redes de tráfico ligadas a grupos ilegais colombianos e estrangeiros, que "provavelmente" chegaram ao Haiti.
As armas foram retiradas "com destino a terceirados como grupos armados na Colômbia [...] e provavelmente conflitos estrangeiros, o mais próximo sendo o do Haiti", declarou o mandatário a partir da Casa de Nariño.
Segundo Petro, "há mais de um milhão de munições perdidas, entre munições, explosivos, granadas, armas como mísseis" provenientes das bases militares de Tolemaida (centro) e La Guajira (norte).
"Há muito tempo existem redes integradas por pessoas das forças militares e civis dedicadas ao comércio massivo de armas", acrescentou Petro.
Na Colômbia, um país atravessado por meio século de conflito armado, as forças de segurança foram envolvidas em frequentes escândalos de corrupção e cumplicidade com narcotraficantes e guerrilheiros.
O desaparecimento do armamento foi detectado em uma inspeção de inventário. Ao lado do ministro da Defesa, Iván Velásquez, e do comandante geral das Forças Militares, Helder Giraldo Bonilla, Petro destacou que o Haiti está "a sete horas de lancha rápida da base da La Guajira", um dos arsenais roubados.
Em 7 de julho de 2021, um comando de mercenários colombianos assassinou a tiros o presidente haitiano Jovenel Moïse, de 53 anos, em sua residência privada, sem que a segurança presidencial entrasse em ação.
O pequeno país, considerado o mais pobre das Américas, mergulhou em um profundo caos social desde a morte de Moïse e tem sido assolado pela violência armada por parte de gangues que controlam grande parte do país e da capital, Porto Príncipe.
"Esperamos concretizar as investigações para [tomar] todas as decisões que devem ser adotadas", disse o ministro Velásquez, questionado sobre possíveis demissões dentro das bases militares afetadas.
A Colômbia vive um conflito armado que, em seis décadas, deixou 9,5 milhões de vítimas entre sequestrados, desaparecidos, deslocados e assassinados.

Article: A Suprema Corte do Panamá começou a analisar, nesta terça-feira (30), a legalidade da candidatura presidencial do opositor direitista José Raúl Mulino, substituto do ex-presidente asilado Ricardo Martinelli e favorito a vencer as eleições do próximo domingo.
O órgão judicial informou, em nota, que os magistrados "acordaram se manter em uma sessão permanente até chegarem a uma decisão" sobre a ação apresentada contra o Tribunal Eleitoral (TE) por ter aceito a candidatura de Mulino.
A corte não informou até quando estarão em sessão permanente, nem se a resolução será anunciada antes ou depois das eleições, gerando temores de uma crise política.
Mulino lidera as pesquisas com entre 25% a 30% das intenções de voto, o dobro de seus seguidores imediatos: o ex-presidente social-democrata Martín Torrijos (2004-2009); e os advogados de centro direita Ricardo Lombana e Rómulo Roux.
Também advogado, Mulino, de 64 anos, era candidato a vice-presidente de Martinelli pelos partidos Realizando Metas (fundado pelo ex-governante) e Aliança.
No entanto, Martinelli foi inabilitado pelo TE após ter sido condenado a quase 11 anos de prisão por lavagem de dinheiro, e assim pediu asilo na embaixada da Nicarágua.
Este tribunal deu seu aval, então, a que Mulino substituísse o ex-chefe de Estado como candidato presidencial. Foi um "golpe na institucionalidade democrática", afirmou à AFP Lina Vega, presidente da Transparência Internacional no Panamá.
Uma advogada apresentou a ação contra esta decisão, argumentando que ele não havia sido eleito nas primárias, nem tinha candidato a vice,
- "Martinelli é Mulino" -
O decreto que regula estas eleições, decididas no primeiro turno e por maioria simples, diz que os candidatos presidenciais devem passar pelas primárias se o partido político pelo qual se lançar tiver mais de 100.000 afiliados.
Segundo o Tribunal Eleitoral, o partido Realizando Metas (RM, iniciais de Martinelli) tem cerca de 200.000 membros.
Mulino foi ministro da Segurança durante o governo de Martinelli (2009-2014). No passado, também foi chanceler e ministro da Justiça. Entre 2015 e 2016, esteve em prisão preventiva por corrupção, mas foi libertado devido a erros processuais.
Apesar de estar asilado, Martinelli fez campanha eleitoral para Mulino e participou do encerramento da campanha no domingo passado por vídeo.
"Martinelli é Mulino e Mulino é Martinelli", diz o lema de campanha do candidato direitista.
Os seguidores de Martinelli garantem que em seu governo a economia, impulsionada por grandes obras de infraestrutura, como a ampliação do canal do Panamá e a primeira linha de metrô, estava melhor.
Alguns asseguram, inclusive, que Martinelli "roubou, mas fez".
- Incerteza -
A situação de Mulino gerou forte incerteza na reta final das eleições, que aumentou nesta terça a apenas cinco dias das eleições.
"Claro que dá certa ansiedade e incerteza não ter uma decisão da Corte", disse à AFP o sociólogo Danilo Toro.
No entanto, a maior tensão social e política pode ocorrer porque "não há atores políticos que apresentem condições de governabilidade para o Panamá" após as eleições, onde o vencedor pode ter menos de um terço dos votos, acrescentou.
As seções vão abrir às 07h locais (09h de Brasília) e fechar às 16h (18h de Brasília).

Article: Estados Unidos e México definiram medidas mais rigorosas contra a imigração irregular, como restringir o uso dos meios de transporte e aumentar as expulsões de imigrantes, anunciou a Casa Branca nesta terça-feira (30).
O presidente dos Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, e seu contraparte mexicano, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, decidiram, em conversa telefônica no último fim de semana, tomar medidas concretas para reduzir "as travessias fronteiriças irregulares", informou o governo americano, sem dar detalhes.
O porta-voz do Conselho de Segurança Nacional, John Kirby, deu algumas pistas hoje. Tratam-se de medidas mais rigorosas para evitar que meios de transporte públicos sejam usados para a imigração irregular, afirmou. "E do aumento dos voos de repatriação, tanto a partir dos Estados Unidos quanto do México."
Kirby ressaltou que o governo mexicano trabalha "arduamente para reduzir o nível e volume das ondas de pessoas que se dirigem à fronteira" com os Estados Unidos.
A patrulha fronteiriça americana interceptou em março 189.372 vezes imigrantes e solicitantes de asilo que cruzaram ilegalmente a fronteira com o México, a maioria deles latinos, segundo dados oficiais. Em dezembro, foram quase 302 mil.
O fluxo de imigrantes deve aumentar nos próximos meses, com a chegada do calor, ressaltou Kirby.
A crise migratória na fronteira é um tema central da campanha para as eleições presidenciais de novembro nos Estados Unidos.

O mau tempo afetou 77 municípios gaúchos e deixou também seis feridos. Quase cem pessoas foram evacuadas de suas casas, de acordo com um comunicado.
O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva conversou com o governador do estado, Eduardo Leite (PSDB-RS), e ofereceu ajuda.
"O governo federal irá se somar aos esforços do governo estadual e prefeituras para atravessarmos e superarmos mais esse momento difícil, reflexos das mudanças climáticas que afetam o planeta", escreveu Lula na rede X.
As autoridades concentravam seus esforços no resgate de pessoas isoladas pelas inundações, à espera de uma piora das condições meteorológicas.
"Nas próximas horas, espera-se que o volume de chuvas continue elevado [...] Todos os rios monitorados estão com níveis acima dos limites de alerta", informou o governo do Rio Grande do Sul em outro comunicado.
No fim de março, fortes chuvas no Sudeste deixaram ao menos 25 mortos nos estados do Rio de Janeiro e do Espírito Santo.
O Sul e o Sudeste têm sido impactados pela chegada de uma frente fria que se seguiu a uma onda de calor extremo.

Article: O responsável do Escritório das Nações Unidas para a Coordenação de Assuntos Humanitários (OCHA), Martin Griffiths, disse, nesta terça-feira (30), que uma ofensiva terrestre israelense na cidade de Rafah, no sul da Faixa de Gaza, seria uma "tragédia indescritível".
"A verdade é que uma operação em Rafah não será nada menos que uma tragédia indescritível. Nenhum plano humanitário pode se contrapor a isso", disse Griffiths depois que o primeiro-ministro israelense, Benjamin Netanyahu, prometeu lançar uma ofensiva sobre essa cidade, onde 1,5 milhão de palestinos estão refugiados.
Enquanto o Hamas analisava o plano de trégua proposto nas conversas no Egito com mediadores americanos, egípcios e cataris, Netanyahu prometeu atacar Rafah "com ou sem acordo".
Washington se uniu aos chamados de vários países e organizações humanitárias para que Israel se abstenha de atacar a cidade diante do temor de que isso resulte em um massacre de civis.
"Para as agências que lutam para oferecer ajuda humanitária apesar das hostilidades, das estradas intransitáveis, das munições sem detonar, da escassez de combustível, dos atrasos nos postos de controle e das restrições israelenses, uma invasão terrestre seria um golpe desastroso", disse Griffiths.
"Estamos em uma corrida para evitar a fome e a morte, e estamos perdendo", advertiu.
A guerra na Faixa de Gaza começou após o ataque do Hamas em 7 de outubro de 2023 no sul de Israel, no qual comandos do movimento islamista mataram 1.170 pessoas, a maioria civis, e sequestraram por volta de 250, segundo uma estimativa da AFP baseada em dados oficiais israelenses.
Em represália, Israel lançou uma ofensiva contra o Hamas que já deixou 34.535 mortos, principalmente civis, segundo o Ministério da Saúde do território, governado pelo movimento islamista desde 2007.

Article: Cinco pessoas morreram e 18 estão desaparecidas após as tempestades que atingiram o Rio Grande do Sul, informou nesta terça-feira (30) o governo do estado.
O mau tempo afetou 77 municípios gaúchos e deixou 6 feridos. Quase 300 pessoas tiveram que abandonar suas casas e a maioria delas foi levada para abrigos, segundo a nota divulgada pelo governo.
O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva conversou com o governador Eduardo Leite (PSDB-RS) e ofereceu ajuda. "O governo federal vai se somar aos esforços do governo estadual e prefeituras para atravessarmos e superarmos mais esse momento difícil, reflexos das mudanças climáticas que afetam o planeta", publicou Lula na rede social X.

"Nas próximas horas, espera-se que o volume de chuvas continue elevado. Todos os rios monitorados estão com níveis acima dos limites de alerta", informou o governo do Rio Grande do Sul.
Existe risco de inundações em algumas áreas, com uma situação grave nos vales do Caí e Taquari, onde houve cheias em novembro passado.
Os trabalhos de resgate se intensificaram no município de Candelária, que está em estado crítico, segundo autoridades. As Forças Armadas disponibilizaram aviões para realizar resgates em áreas de difícil acesso, e aeronaves da polícia estão prontas para ajudar na tarefa, à espera de condições meteorológicas favoráveis.
No fim de março, tempestades no Sudeste deixaram ao menos 25 mortos nos estados do Rio de Janeiro e Espírito Santo. O Sul e o Sudeste têm sido impactados pela chegada de uma frente fria, que se seguiu a uma onda de calor extremo.
Especialistas atribuem os fenômenos extremos e a instabilidade meteorológica às mudanças climáticas e ao fenômeno El Niño.

Article: Donald Trump esboçou como seria um eventual segundo mandato de presidente, em uma entrevista publicada nesta terça-feira (30) pela revista Time: aval para que os estados proíbam o aborto, mobilização do Exército para a deportação de migrantes e ajuda militar condicionada para os aliados dos Estados Unidos.
O magnata republicano, que deverá enfrentar o presidente democrata Joe Biden nas eleições de novembro, respondeu às perguntas em uma entrevista em duas partes, uma realizada em sua residência na Flórida e outra por telefone, sobre o que faria em caso de vitória.
Um dos entrevistadores mencionou a interrupção voluntária da gravidez, um dos principais temas de campanha. Trump, de 77 anos, que atualmente é processado em Nova York em uma das muitas investigações abertas contra ele, se esquivou da pergunta sobre se vetaria uma lei federal que restringe duramente o direito ao aborto.
"Não tenho que vetá-la porque agora tudo volta para os estados", disse o ex-presidente, em referência à sentença de 2022 da Suprema Corte, que pôs fim à proteção federal do direito ao aborto e devolveu essa competência aos governos estaduais.
Trump também não viu problema na possibilidade de os estados monitorarem a gestação das mulheres para garantir que a proibição do aborto seja respeitada. "Acredito que poderiam fazê-lo", disse.
Em relação à imigração, outro dos temas centrais das eleições, o republicano repetiu que realizaria deportações em massa de migrantes ilegais.
"A Guarda Nacional deveria poder fazer isso. Se não puderem, eu usaria o Exército", declarou à revista Time.
"Eles não são civis. São pessoas que não estão legalmente em nosso país. Isso é uma invasão", enfatizou Trump, após um entrevistador lembrar que as leis locais impedem o uso do Exército contra a população civil em solo americano.
Trump garantiu que "não descartaria nada" em relação à criação de campos de detenção de migrantes, mas acredita que não serão necessários, porque seu programa de deportação terá êxito.
- Ucrânia -
Em relação à economia, o ex-presidente disse que previa tarifas alfandegarias de "mais de 10%" sobre todas as importações.
E sobre a ajuda à Ucrânia, Trump afirmou: "Não darei [mais ajuda] se a Europa não fizer tanto quanto" os Estados Unidos.
O republicano também acredita que, caso a Coreia do Sul queira que os soldados americanos estacionados em seu território permaneçam, terá que pagar mais: "Por que deveríamos defender alguém? E estamos falando de um país muito rico".
"Acredito que o inimigo interno é, em muitos casos, muito mais perigoso para nosso país que os inimigos estrangeiros como China, Rússia e outros", afirmou o magnata, que em várias ocasiões chegou a elogiar líderes autoritários.
Ele acrescentou que está "absolutamente" disposto a indultar todos os condenados por invadir o Capitólio em 6 de janeiro de 2021, durante a tentativa de impedir que o Congresso certificasse a vitória de seu rival, Joe Biden, nas eleições.
Questionado sobre a possibilidade de conflito social após as eleições de 5 de novembro, Trump, que também responde a processos por seu papel no ataque de 6 de janeiro e por fraude eleitoral no estado da Geórgia entre outras acusações, respondeu: "Acho que vamos ter uma grande vitória e não haverá violência (...) Se não vencermos, você sabe, vai depender".
O republicano, que nunca reconheceu a vitória do adversário democrata em 2020, afirmou que, caso a Suprema Corte não lhe conceda imunidade presidencial, como ele pede, "Biden será processado por todos os seus crimes, porque ele cometeu vários crimes".

Nesta terça-feira, 30 de abril, o Grupo de Atuação Especial de Combate ao Crime Organizado (Gaeco) de Londrina, vinculado ao Ministério Público do Paraná, realizou cinco mandados de busca e apreensão em uma operação denominada “Operação Arremate”. A ação visa investigar possíveis fraudes em leilões judiciais, onde ilícitos como frustração do caráter competitivo de licitações e corrupção ativa e/ou passiva foram supostamente praticados por um leiloeiro judicial e envolvidos adicionais.
Segundo investigações, o leiloeiro teria manipulado leilões para que arrematações fossem feitas por indivíduos previamente escolhidos, muitas vezes com lances únicos e abaixo do valor de mercado. A falta de publicidade adequada nos leilões facilitou as ações fraudulentas, comprovadas também pelo uso de uma funcionária e um familiar desta para arrematar bens de interesse do leiloeiro, incluindo um imóvel em Santa Catarina.
As ordens judiciais foram emitidas pela 3ª Vara Criminal de Londrina e contaram com o suporte da Corregedoria da Polícia Civil, devido à suspeita de envolvimento de um policial civil no esquema. O leiloeiro investigado e outros suspeitos enfrentam acusações de lavagem de dinheiro e falsidade ideológica, entre outros crimes.
O promotor do Gaeco, Leandro Antunes, em entrevista, detalhou que as investigações começaram há mais de um ano a partir de denúncias de irregularidades em leilões de veículos e imóveis. As medidas cautelares adotadas até o momento incluem as buscas realizadas, com a possibilidade de expansão das ações conforme avança a investigação.

Article: Foi a 9 mil quilômetros da Faixa de Gaza, em Manhattan, onde começaram os protestos que agitam as universidades dos Estados Unidos: na prestigiada Columbia, em Nova York, onde estudantes ocupam o campus e enfrentam autoridades.
Uma bandeira com os dizeres "Palestina Livre" foi pendurada em uma das janelas da instituição, que restringiu fortemente o acesso ao campus, onde havia hoje uma pequena presença policial.
A estudante de economia Tina Deng, 25, diz que não tem opinião formada sobre o protesto, mas culpa as autoridades universitárias por terem feito a polícia intervir e prender manifestantes no último dia 18, o que, segundo ela, fez o clima de tensão aumentar.
"O mesmo pode acontecer com quem vier a expressar sua opinião no futuro", diz a aluna estrangeira, que também lamenta os transtornos causados aos estudantes, que não podem acessar o restaurante universitário nem a biblioteca.
Epicentro das manifestações pró-palestinos que se espalharam por dezenas de universidades americanas e de outros países, os jardins de Columbia costumam estar cheios de estudantes. Mas hoje, os poucos que havia pareciam tensos.
Ao amanhecer, um pequeno grupo ocupou o prédio administrativo depois que autoridades informaram que haviam começado a suspender os alunos por não respeitarem a ordem de remoção do acampamento montado nos jardins.
- 'Tratados com desprezo' -
Os manifestantes pedem o fim do conflito na Faixa de Gaza e da ocupação israelense dos territórios palestinos. Também exigem que a universidade rompa seus laços com Israel e o retorno da centena de estudantes suspensos após a intervenção policial de abril, cujas imagens correram o mundo.
"Você acorda de manhã e tudo o que ouve são helicópteros e sirenes da polícia. E descobre que seus colegas foram agredidos ou presos", conta o estudante de direito Mohamed Ali, 24.
"Estavam aqui pacificamente e foram tratados com desprezo. Todos nós somos tratados com desprezo", reclama o jovem, para quem os estudantes "são punidos coletivamente" para que se voltem contra os manifestantes.
Felipe Poelling, 19, aprova o movimento: "São meus colegas, acredito que saibam por que estão lutando, admiro isso."
- 'Longe demais' -
Autoridades de Columbia, assim como parte da classe política, principalmente os republicanos, acusam os manifestantes de antissemitismo, devido às suas palavras hostis a Israel, um grande aliado dos Estados Unidos no Oriente Médio.
A universidade ameaçou expulsar os alunos que participam do protesto, que responderam convocando seus simpatizantes a se manifestarem no campus ou em frente à instituição. "Tomar nosso campus é a única resposta a uma instituição que não segue suas próprias normas ou regras éticas", disseram ontem os líderes do protesto, em entrevista coletiva.
Perto do campus, o estudante de ciência política David, que preferiu não informar o sobrenome, diz estar chateado. Ele quer o fim "do derramamento de sangue" nos dois lados do conflito.
"Nos Estados Unidos, temos o direito de nos reunir pacificamente, um direito que valorizamos muito. Mas você não tem o direito de tomar um local, organizar motins e agressões. Isso é ir longe demais", criticou o aluno.

Article: Seis municípios devem receber em julho as primeiras solturas de mosquitos Aedes aegypti infectados com a bactéria wolbachia: Uberlândia em Minas Gerais; Londrina e Foz do Iguaçu, no Paraná; Presidente Prudente, em São Paulo, Joinville, em Santa Catarina; e Natal, capital do Rio Grande do Norte. No ano que vem, a estratégia será adotada em mais 22 municípios de Minas Gerais. Segundo o Ministério da Saúde, o Brasil é o primeiro país a incorporar a tecnologia como política pública para reduzir os casos de dengue a médio e longo prazo.
O chamado método Wolbachia consiste em inserir a bactéria em ovos do mosquito em laboratório e criar Aedes aegypti que portam o microrganismo. Infectados, eles não são capazes de carregar os vírus que causam dengue, zika, chikungunya ou febre amarela e, quando se reproduzem, os mosquitos passam a bactéria para outros, fazendo com que menos insetos possam transmitir doenças para os seres humanos.

- Dengue: Minas inaugura biofábrica do método Wolbachia.
- Método Wolbachia reduz casos de dengue em Niterói.
- Brasil passa de 4 milhões de casos de dengue; mortes chegam a 1.937.
Segundo Ethel, há uma série de critérios que precisam ser observados para que o município receba essa estratégia, principalmente a pouca variação de temperatura durante o dia, porque isso prejudica a adaptação do mosquito com a wolbachia.
De acordo com a secretária, a estratégia tem se mostrado bastante efetiva. Um exemplo é a cidade de Niterói, no estado do Rio, a primeira a receber o projeto na etapa de pesquisa, em 2014, que teve redução de 69,4% dos casos de dengue, 56,3% nos de chikungunya e 37% nos de zika. "Lá, o número de casos é bem inferior ao dos municípios vizinhos, mostrando que a médio e longo prazo a estratégia pode ser muito importante", disse a secretária, em entrevista nesta terça-feira (30).
Outras cidades do país que estão utilizando o Método Wolbachia são o Rio de Janeiro, Campo Grande e Petrolina, em Pernambuco. Além do Brasil, Indonésia e mais três países participam da pesquisa em parceria com o World Mosquito Program.
Ontem (29), o Ministério da Saúde e o governo de Minas Gerais inauguraram a Biofábrica Wolbachia, em Belo Horizonte. A unidade, administrada pela Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), vai permitir ao Brasil ampliar sua capacidade de produção de uma das principais tecnologias no combate à dengue e outras arboviroses.

Article: O Conselho Nacional de Trânsito (Contran), vinculado ao Ministério dos Transportes, publicou uma resolução que permite aos motoristas solicitar o cancelamento da própria Carteira Nacional de Trânsito (CNH) sem a necessidade de apresentar motivação, no departamento estadual de trânsito (Detran) responsável pelo registro. Uma CNH comprova que o condutor está apto a dirigir veículos para os quais está habilitado em todo território nacional.
O Ministério dos Transportes explica que a solicitação de cancelamento do registro da CNH terá como consequência a retirada do condutor da base nacional do Registro Nacional de Condutores Habilitados (Renach). "Desta maneira, caso o cidadão deseje voltar a dirigir, deverá iniciar novo processo de primeira habilitação", diz a nota.
Notícias relacionadas:
- Termina hoje prazo para que condutores façam teste toxicológico.
- Motoristas têm novos prazos para regularizar exame toxicológico.
"Os motoristas das categorias C, D e E, que não têm mais a intenção ou não precisam dirigir esses veículos ou já não exercem mais uma atividade remunerada na direção, têm até o 30º dia após o vencimento do exame [toxicológico] para poder pedir o rebaixamento dessa CNH e, assim, não pagar a multa", explica a diretora de Comunicação da Associação Brasileira de Toxicologia (ABTox), Camille Lages. A partir do 31º dia, eles já terão que arcar com a multa do Código Nacional de Trânsito, pelo simples fato de não fazer o exame toxicológico"
Outra possibilidade é o motorista profissional pedir ao Detran estadual o rebaixamento das categorias C, D e E para as habilitações mais comuns no país, a A e B. A categoria A é destinada à condução de motocicletas, triciclos, motonetas e outros veículos de duas rodas. No tipo B, a pessoa pode conduzir veículos de quatro rodas com capacidade para até oito passageiros.
De acordo com Ministério dos Transportes, tanto a mudança das categorias C, D ou E para as categorias B e AB, como a solicitação de cancelamento da CNH, até o 30º dia após o vencimento do prazo para realização do exame toxicológico afasta a possibilidade da multa de R$ 1.467,35 e sete pontos na CNH por infração gravíssima.
Exame toxicológico 2024
Em 2024, precisam atualizar o exame toxicológico até esta terça-feira (30), os motoristas profissionais com a CNH nas categorias C, D e E, com prazos de validade entre janeiro e junho, de qualquer ano. "Assim, solicitando hoje, 30 de abril, o cancelamento junto ao Detran, [o motorista] estará respaldado e não incorrerá em infração de trânsito", esclareceu o Ministério dos Transportes, a poucas horas do fim do prazo, nesta terça.
O segundo grupo de motoristas profissionais com a CNH com validade entre julho e dezembro, têm até 31 de maio deste ano para realizar exame toxicológico.
A diretora Camille Lages explica que estes condutores, especificamente, ainda poderão ser beneficiados pela nova resolução do Contran, se pedirem o rebaixamento da CNH ou cancelamento nos próximos dois dias. Contudo a resolução terá impacto mesmo nos próximos vencimentos.
"Todos os meses, há motoristas precisando fazer o exame {toxicológico]. Então, eles precisam saber que se têm a CNH nestas categorias que não são usadas por alguma razão ou não precisam mais dela, o melhor é realmente pedir o rebaixamento, que aí ficam livres disso tudo", orienta a diretora da ABTox.

Article: Após dias de trégua, o mercado financeiro voltou a enfrentar momentos de nervosismo nesta terça-feira (30). O dólar teve forte alta e aproximou-se de R$ 5,20. A bolsa caiu mais de 1% e perdeu os 126 mil pontos.
O dólar comercial encerrou o dia vendido a R$ 5,193, com alta de R$ 0,076 (+1,52%). A cotação operou o dia inteiro em alta e fechou na máxima do dia, com investidores comprando dólares à espera da reunião do Federal Reserve (Fed, Banco Central norte-americano), que ocorrerá nesta quarta-feira (1º).

No mercado de ações, o dia também foi tenso. O índice Ibovespa, da B3, fechou aos 125.924 pontos, com queda de 1,12%. O indicador fechou o mês com queda de 1,7%.
No exterior, houve uma corrida aos títulos do Tesouro norte-americano, considerados os investimentos mais seguros do mundo, na véspera da reunião do Fed. Essa migração estimula a fuga de recursos de países emergentes como o Brasil, pressionando o dólar e a bolsa.
Os investidores aguardam alguma indicação, na reunião desta quarta-feira (1º), de quando o Fed começará a reduzir os juros na maior economia do planeta. Parte do mercado acredita que as taxas começarão a cair em setembro. Outra parte, só em novembro.
No Brasil, os números da criação de empregos em março pressionaram a bolsa de valores. Embora o aumento de postos de trabalho seja uma boa notícia para a economia em geral, o fenômeno provoca tensões no mercado financeiro porque aumenta as chances de o Banco Central brasileiro reduzir o ritmo de cortes da Taxa Selic (juros básicos da economia).
Juros mais altos que o previsto estimulam a migração de investimentos da bolsa de valores para investimentos em renda fixa, como títulos públicos.

Article: O empenho (autorização) de emendas parlamentares atingiu a marca de R$ 14 bilhões nos quatro primeiros meses do ano, disse nesta terça-feira (30) o ministro das Relações Institucionais, Alexandre Padilha. Em publicação na rede social X, antigo Twitter, o ministro anunciou o cumprimento do compromisso com o Congresso.
"Estamos fechando o dia de hoje, 30 de abril, com um recorde de publicação de empenhos de emendas parlamentares. Ultrapassamos R$ 14 bilhões de publicados para empenho dessas emendas parlamentares, entre emendas individuais e emendas de bancada. Isso é mais recurso para a saúde, para a estrutura das cidades. O Ministério da Saúde foi o campeão já nesse empenho. Parabéns ao trabalho do Ministério da Saúde", afirmou Padilha no vídeo, de quase dois minutos.
Notícias relacionadas:
- Dino quer ouvir Congresso sobre suposta ilegalidade em emendas.
- Governo publica calendário de pagamento de emendas parlamentares.
"Mais de 90% desses recursos são para redução de filas de cirurgia, redução de filas de exames, apoiar o trabalho das equipes da saúde da família, dos agentes comunitários de saúde, reforço dos hospitais, para as Santa Casas, ações que contribuem para a saúde do nosso povo", acrescentou.
O ministro ainda fez uma comparação com anos anteriores. Nos quatro primeiros meses de 2023, disse Padilha, o volume de emendas empenhadas estava em R$ 350 milhões. Em relação ao primeiro quadrimestre de 2020, ano das últimas eleições municipais, os R$ 14 bilhões equivalem a mais de três vezes o gasto autorizado.
Padilha disse haver espaço de quase R$ 1 bilhão em emendas individuais cujos gastos ainda não foram indicados pelos municípios, pelas entidades nem pelos parlamentares beneficiados. Por causa da legislação eleitoral, os recursos precisam estar empenhados até 30 de junho.
O Executivo estava sendo pressionado pelo Congresso a liberar R$ 11 bilhões em emendas parlamentares até o fim de abril. O governo, no entanto, até agora cumpriu apenas a fase de empenho (autorização), enquanto os deputados e senadores cobravam a execução (o pagamento) das emendas nesse período.
A autorização garante o pagamento das emendas nos próximos meses, já que a legislação eleitoral veda apenas o empenho a partir do segundo semestre. O Orçamento obedece a três fases: empenho (autorização), liberação (quando o governo verifica se o serviço foi executado) e pagamento (desembolso efetivo dos recursos).

Article: O Ministério Público do Rio de Janeiro e a Polícia Civil cumpriram nesta terça-feira (30) mandados de busca e apreensão em 14 endereços de pessoas físicas e empresas relacionadas à exploração do jogo do bicho e máquinas caça-níqueis. Chamada de Bancarrota, a operação teve como alvo a organização criminosa liderada pelo contraventor José Caruzzo Escafura, o Piruinha, de 94 anos.
Os promotores de Justiça e os policiais estiveram na sede do Clube Oposição, na Abolição, e do Clube Grêmio Recreativo Vera Cruz, em Piedade, ambos na zona norte.
Notícias relacionadas:
Os mandados foram cumpridos nos bairros do Engenho Novo, Bento Ribeiro, Jacarepaguá, Realengo, Madureira, Cascadura, Brás de Pina e Cavalcanti.
Absolvição
Na semana passada, o 3º Tribunal do Júri do Rio de Janeiro absolveu Piruinha pelo assassinato do empresário Natalino José do Nascimento Espíndola, em julho de 2021. Também foram julgados e absolvidos a filha de Piruinha, Monalliza Neves Escafura, e o policial militar Jeckeson Lima Pereira.
Os três eram acusados de matar Natalino em uma emboscada, quando o empresário andava a pé, por uma rua da zona oeste da cidade do Rio de Janeiro. A acusação era que a família Escafura havia perdido dinheiro com um empreendimento de construção capitaneado pela vítima e, por isso, decretara sua morte.
Piruinha estava com mandado de prisão preventiva desde maio de 2022, mas cumpria a medida judicial em prisão domiciliar desde que sofrera um acidente na no banheiro da Casa do Albergado Crispim Valentino, em Benfica, em dezembro daquele ano.

Segundo ele, o ajuizamento da ação no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) foi um erro primário do governo federal e gera uma crise de confiança na relação entre os Poderes.
"É inegável o direito que se tem de acessar a Justiça, é direito do cidadão e também de um poder. A questão que nós ponderamos apenas é que em um tema que está sendo discutido no ambiente da política, entre o Poder Executivo e o Poder Legislativo, estamos no meio dessa discussão política, haver a precipitação do ajuizamento de uma ação. Esse ponto atribuímos ser um erro do governo federal sob todos os aspectos", disse Pacheco, em entrevista coletiva.

Salários
Pacheco voltou a condicionar a votação da PEC do Quinquênio, que cria adicional sobre o salário de carreiras jurídicas, ao projeto que acaba com os supersalários no serviço público. Segundo ele, a economia para as contas públicas que seria gerada com o projeto de lei que combate os supersalários é superior ao incremento de gasto, dentro do Orçamento, para o pagamento do quinquênio, um bônus de 5% do salário a cada cinco anos a carreiras do Judiciário.
"As duas coisas casadas e em conjunto significam economia para o Estado brasileiro. Essa combinação do projeto de lei com a emenda não altera em nada nossa busca do cumprimento da meta fiscal", disse.

Tentei até onde pude, me dediquei ao máximo, mas cheguei ao meu limite físico, mental e emocional. É muito difícil aceitar isso, mas chega um momento onde o ser humano por trás do atleta precisa ser priorizado. Conversei com a minha família, minha equipe, com os médicos e tomamos essa decisão em conjunto", explicou o nadador.

Article: O Senado Federal aprovou nesta terça-feira (30) o projeto de lei que prorroga o Programa Emergencial de Retomada do Setor de Serviços (Perse), de incentivo ao setor de eventos, até dezembro de 2026. A proposta fixa um teto de R$ 15 bilhões em renúncia fiscal e reduz de 44 para 30 as atividades beneficiadas pelo programa. O texto aprovado pelos senadores manteve as regras que já haviam sido aprovadas na semana passada pela Câmara dos Deputados. Agora, o projeto vai à sanção presidencial.
A aprovação ocorreu após consenso firmado entre o Congresso Nacional o governo federal. O Perse foi criado em 2021, no contexto da pandemia de covid-19, como socorro ao setor de eventos, que ficou praticamente paralisado naquele período. O governo havia trabalhado, nos últimos meses, para encerrar completamente os benefícios tributários do programa, mas enfrentou resistência de parlamentares e do setores afetados. O acordo permite o fim gradual do programa em dois anos.

"Viva o Perse, sim ao Perse. Não é farra com dinheiro público. O Perse é justiça social para quem trabalha, para quem honra. Se houve em algum momento, e houve, algum erro durante o processo do percursos, que pode acontecer com qualquer programa, que se coloquem as travas, como foram colocadas", afirmou a senadora Daniella Ribeiro (PSD-PB), em discurso após a aprovação simbólica do texto.
O projeto aprovado estabelece um acompanhamento bimestral da Receita Federal da isenção fiscal dos tributos. A expectativa é que o governo sancione a medida sem vetos, mantendo o acordo celebrado com o Legislativo e as empresas do setor, já nos próximos dias.

Article: Dados do Alerta Rio revelam que este foi o abril mais seco desde 1997, quando o sistema meteorológico da prefeitura da capital fluminense começou a fazer a medição. As altas temperaturas e a baixa umidade relativa do ar foram o destaque deste mês no município.
Nos 30 dias do mês, houve registro de chuva em apenas quatro. O volume médio de chuva para todo o mês era de 117,5 milímetros (mm), porém, os pluviômetros do Alerta Rio registraram apenas 8,3 mm, ou seja, choveu 7,1% da média.
O levantamento mostra que a média das temperaturas máximas para o mês é de 31,3°C, enquanto a média das máximas de abril deste ano ficou 2 graus acima: 33,5°C. Já a maior temperatura registrada no município foi 39,1°C, no dia 28.
O Sistema Alerta Rio também destaca a baixa umidade relativa do ar. Durante o mês, três dias tiveram índices de umidade abaixo de 30%: 23, 24 e 28 de abril.
A meteorologista-chefe do Sistema Alerta Rio, Raquel Franco, explica o que levou a esse recorde: "Tivemos a atuação de um sistema de alta pressão, com característica de bloqueio principalmente no final do mês. Isso formou uma barreira que impediu a chuva de chegar. Ou seja, as frentes frias que passaram foram bem mais oceânicas, causando pouca chuva e por pouco tempo."
Os primeiros dias de maio deverão continuar secos, quentes e sem chuva no município. Na quarta (1º) e quinta-feira (2), o tempo permanecerá estável, com céu com poucas nuvens e sem previsão de chuva. Os ventos estarão fracos a moderados e as temperaturas, elevadas, podendo passar de 38°C.

Article: Maria Laerte da Conceição mora no Distrito Federal e teve dois netos condenados e presos. Em março, a avó dos detentos pediu para visitá-los, mas o pleito foi barrado pela Justiça. Segundo o Tribunal de Justiça do Distrito Federal e Territórios (TJDFT), ela só tem direito a visitar um deles e precisa escolher qual vai ver na prisão.
O TJDFT rejeitou o pedido de Maria da Conceição alegando que uma regra local só autoriza pai e mãe a visitar mais de um preso no sistema prisional da capital federal. A vedação de múltiplas visitas por uma só pessoa foi criada sob alegação de tentar impedir a circulação de interlocutores de facções criminosas dentro dos presídios.
Procurado pelo Estadão, o TJ-DFT afirmou que uma portaria de 2016 normatizou as visitas nos presídios, como forma de "preservar o direito das pessoas presas e a segurança e a estabilidade do sistema prisional". "Assim, de acordo com a norma, somente os pais e os filhos, e, ainda, se um dos presos não tiver visitante algum, é que é possível fazer visitas em mais de um presídio por vez. A Vara de Execuções Penais do Distrito Federal (VEP-DF) ressalta ainda que os casos são analisados individualmente e, quando possível, os presos que são parentes são colocados em um mesmo presídio para facilitar a visitação", afirmou a Corte.
No dia 19 de março, o juiz Bruno Macacari negou o pedido da avó. Ela queria ir ver o neto Douglas Pereira da Silva, que está preso desde janeiro deste ano. O magistrado argumentou que ela já vai ao sistema penitenciário encontrar outro neto, Vinícius Pereira da Silva, irmão de Douglas, que também está encarcerado.
Ao negar o pedido feito pela avó, Macacari citou que a lei da capital federal impede que pessoas se cadastrem para visitar mais de um preso, mesmo que eles estejam em presídios diferentes. A única exceção prevista pela portaria, que está em vigor desde 2016, é quando se trata do pai ou mãe de diferentes detentos.
A mãe dos presos, Lívia Pereira de Brito, faleceu de câncer em 2003, quando os filhos tinham cinco e um ano de idade. Segundo a esposa de Douglas, que não quis se identificar, Maria Laerte foi quem criou os dois desde a infância e é a figura materna dos detentos.
O juiz do TJ-DFT afirma que a limitação da visita para Maria da Conceição é justificada pela "necessidade de frear o crescente movimento de interlocutores" utilizados por grupos criminosos. "Sem a restrição, a ordem, segurança e disciplina dos presídios, bem como o combate ao fortalecimento de facções criminosas ficam comprometidos", disse Macacari.
Vinícius Pereira da Silva foi o primeiro dos netos a ser preso. Foi em julho de 2022. Condenado por tentativa de latrocínio (roubo, seguido de morte), Vinicius recebeu pena de dez anos de prisão. Além outros dois comparsas também foram condenados. Eles planejaram a morte de um comerciante em outubro de 2021 e roubaram 10 mil dólares da vítima. O homem foi amarrado e jogado em um matagal, mas não foi assassinado por "circunstâncias alheias às vontades" dos acusados.
Há o outro neto Douglas foi condenado a cinco anos e quatro meses de reclusão. Sua prisão só foi decretada no início deste ano. Em 2021, ele roubou um celular e uma caixa de som de uma mulher, em Samambaia, região administrativa do DF. Para cometer o crime, ele utilizou uma arma falsa. Acabou sendo atingido por um tiro no cóccix por um policial militar que passava pelo local na hora do assalto.
Defensoria Pública quer que TJDFT afrouxe entendimento e permita visitas da avó
No último dia 21 de março, a Defensoria Pública do Distrito Federal (DP-DF) entrou com recurso pedindo a revisão da decisão do juiz. O órgão afirma que a Constituição Federal assegura que os presos devem receber visitas de familiares e também cita uma decisão da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU), de 1995, que prevê a comunicação periódica dos reclusos com os seus familiares.
"Sendo certo que o contato com parentes e amigos é essencial para a manutenção da estabilidade emocional do detento e, via de consequência, para alcance dos fins da expiação no cárcere, não há razão para que se imponham dificuldades não previstas em lei", diz um trecho do recurso da DP-DF, que ainda não foi analisado pelo TJ-DFT.
De acordo com Felipe Zucchini, coordenador do Núcleo de Execuções Penais da DP-DF, o órgão quer que Maria da Conceição, que é identificada como a presença materna dos irmãos presos, tenha o direito de ver os dois netos garantido. Segundo Zucchini, a Justiça não pode impedir, com argumentos de reforço da segurança pública, que parentes visitem internos do sistema penitenciário.
"Toda família tem o direito de visitar os seus parentes. Ninguém pode fazer uma escolha de qual parente prefere visitar por essas razões de segurança pública. O nosso entendimento é que a ressocialização no ambiente prisional tem sido realizado, sobretudo, com a participação da família", afirmou.
TJDFT diz que regra que limita visitas tenta conter ação de facção criminosa
Em nota o TJDFT explicou que a portaria que regula as visitas a presos foi editada após relatório de inteligência detectar que "presos ligados a facções criminosas estariam se utilizando de visitantes para levarem informações aos presos de um presídio para o outro". Veja a íntegra da nota do Tribunal:
"A VEP/DF esclarece que a Portaria 008/2016 da VEP/DF disciplina as visitas ao sistema prisional do DF há 8 anos. A edição da Portaria baseou-se em relatório de inteligência elaborado à época pelo serviço de inteligência prisional, dando conta que presos ligados a facções criminosas estariam se utilizando de visitantes para levarem informações aos presos de um presídio para o outro.
Assim, por meio da Portaria 8/2016, a visitação foi normatizada, de forma a preservar o direito das pessoas presas e a segurança e a estabilidade do sistema prisional, que, ao fim e ao cabo, também os beneficia, na medida em que tal panorama é a garantia da preservação da integridade física dos presos.
Assim, de acordo com a norma, somente os pais e os filhos, e, ainda, se um dos presos não tiver visitante algum, é que é possível fazer visitas em mais de um presídio por vez. A VEP/DF ressalta ainda que os casos são analisados individualmente e, quando possível, os presos que são parentes são colocados em um mesmo presídio para facilitar a visitação".

Article: Com direito a evento sindical, missa na zona leste e anúncio sobre o plano de governo, os principais pré-candidatos à Prefeitura de São Paulo disputam as atenções do eleitorado nesta quarta-feira, 1º de maio, Dia do Trabalho. A cidade também recebe, pelo segundo ano seguido, o presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), com chances de a visita adquirir contornos eleitorais.
Apoiado pelo petista, o deputado federal Guilherme Boulos (PSOL) estará em mais um evento ao seu lado em São Paulo. Ambos estão confirmados no ato do Dia do Trabalho convocado pelas centrais sindicais para as 10h, no estacionamento da Neo Química Arena, estádio do Corinthians, em Itaquera, na zona leste da cidade.
O evento será realizado de forma conjunta por Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT), Força Sindical, Central dos Sindicatos Brasileiros (CSB), União Geral dos Trabalhadores (UGT), Nova Central Sindical de Trabalhadores (NCST) e Intersindical e Pública. A expectativa, segundo os organizadores, é que o evento receba cerca de 50 mil pessoas.
Os discursos serão divididos em "três atos" intercalados com atrações musicais e que devem durar, ao todo, cerca de 2h30min. Na teoria, Boulos poderia discursar na primeira etapa, dedicada a representantes partidários. Lula fala por último, no terceiro ato, depois dos líderes sindicais.
O prefeito de São Paulo, Ricardo Nunes (MDB), e o governador do Estado, Tarcísio de Freitas (Republicanos), fazem parte da lista de autoridades convidadas, mas não devem comparecer ao ato. Em entrevista coletiva nesta terça-feira, 30, o prefeito alegou conflito com agendas marcadas anteriormente.
A assessoria de Nunes informou que ele irá a uma missa ao ar livre que abre a Festa do Trabalhador no distrito de Ermelino Matarazzo, na zona leste. Outro evento, na Praça do Trabalhador, em Jardim Myrna, na zona sul da cidade, está no radar. A localidade é reduto político do prefeito.
Empatado tecnicamente com Boulos nas pesquisas Datafolha e Atlas, o prefeito paulistano priorizou, ao longo da semana, o discurso voltado para a geração de emprego e renda. Na segunda-feira, 29, o político esteve presente na abertura de um "mutirão de emprego", com oferta de 4 mil vagas em empresas de comércio, serviços e construção civil intermediadas pelos Centros de Apoio ao Trabalho e Empreendedorismo.
Os convites das centrais sindicais a Nunes e Tarcísio, aliás, servem de combustível para as convocações de outros dois partidos de esquerda que planejam disputar as eleições de outubro. Altino Prazeres (PSTU) anunciou presença em evento da CSP-Conlutas em frente ao Teatro Municipal de São Paulo, às 13h. A UP também promete lançar um nome para a capital em evento em Diadema, no ABC paulista, neste 1º de Maio.
Já a deputada Tabata Amaral (PSB) marcou para 17h desta quarta-feira o anúncio da composição dos 35 grupos de trabalho para elaboração de seu plano de governo. O evento será no Teatro Corinthians, no Tatuapé, na zona leste, e terá a presença do vice-presidente Geraldo Alckmin (PSB), segundo adiantou a deputada em entrevista para a rádio Eldorado.
Há expectativa de que a deputada anuncie nomes ligados a gestões tucanas e próximos a Alckmin em reação a Nunes, que busca representar uma continuidade da gestão Bruno Covas e ainda tenta angariar o apoio do PSDB. A coordenadora-geral da equipe de Tabata será Vivian Satiro, especialista em gestão pública que coordenou o plano de governo de Covas em 2020 e fez parte de sua administração.

Article: O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva disse nesta terça-feira, 30, que na próxima quinta, 2, a Jica, Agência para Cooperação Internacional do Japão, em tradução livre, anunciará investimentos no Brasil. Segundo o petista, os recursos serão usados na recuperação de áreas degradadas.
"Na quinta-feira, vou me reunir com o ministro da Agricultura Carlos Fávaro e com esse banco chamado Jica que vai anunciar investimentos na recuperação de áreas degradadas no Brasil. Ao invés de derrubar árvore, nós vamos plantar árvore", disse o presidente brasileiro. A recuperação de terras degradadas para expandir a produção agrícola sem desmatar foi uma promessa de campanha de Lula.
O presidente brasileiro deu a declaração a jornalistas japoneses no Palácio do Planalto pela manhã. O Broadcast Político ouviu o registro da conversa, que não foi divulgado no momento em que acontecia. O primeiro-ministro do Japão, Fumio Kishida, visitará Brasília na sexta-feira, 3.
Lula indicou aos jornalistas do país asiático que cobrará ajuda para preservar as florestas. Esse é um tema comum quando o petista tem conversas com representantes de países ricos - o foco costuma ser a Amazônia. "Espero que o Japão compartilhe com o Brasil a política de manutenção das florestas que queremos ter. Manter uma floresta em pé custa muito dinheiro", declarou o chefe do governo brasileiro.
Na declaração, Lula defendeu a parceria entre empresários de ambos os países. De acordo com o chefe do Executivo, Kishida encontrará empresários brasileiros e japoneses em São Paulo. Além de ser a mais rica do Brasil, a cidade foi o principal destino da imigração japonesa para o País.
"É muito importante que os empresários japoneses pensem em construir parcerias com empresários brasileiros para que a gente possa crescer economicamente, Japão e Brasil", declarou Lula.
"Todo mundo deseja algumas coisas em qualquer país. Você precisa de estabilidade política, estabilidade econômica, de estabilidade fiscal, estabilidade social e precisa de previsibilidade das coisas que vão acontecer no mundo. E o Brasil oferece tudo isso", declarou. "Temos segurança jurídica, política, econômica, social e temos o desejo de fazer o Brasil se transformar em uma das seis maiores economias do mundo. Por isso acho muito importante essa aproximação do Brasil com o Japão", defendeu.
Na avaliação do petista, o país asiático está muito longe do Brasil geograficamente, mas humanisticamente, muito perto. "Porque vivemos em paz, gostamos da paz e achamos que a paz é a melhor forma de você desenvolver uma nação."

Article: Desde que assumiu a presidência da seccional Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil em São Paulo (OAB-SP), em 2022, Patrícia Vanzolini se mantém engajada no debate público, sobretudo nas pautas relacionadas à defesa da democracia. Nascida no Chile, onde seus pais buscaram exílio acuados pela ditadura militar (1964-1985), a criminalista defende com convicção o potencial da OAB para congregar não apenas os advogados, mas também outras vozes da sociedade civil dispersas no campo democrático.
Primeira mulher a dirigir a OAB de São Paulo, a maior seccional do País, após uma eleição marcada por um esforço dos próprios candidatos para se descolarem da polarização política, a advogada faz uma gestão essencialmente voltada à classe, mas sem ignorar o cenário mais amplo que envolve o Poder Judiciário.
Sob seu comando, a seccional da OAB participou da organização do ato em defesa da democracia que reuniu expoentes do Judiciário na Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo (USP), no Largo do São Francisco, em agosto de 2022. Na ocasião, afirmou em um discurso acalorado que advocacia e democracia são "inseparáveis".
A advogada também foi anfitriã de um seminário organizado pela OAB de São Paulo para relembrar os 40 anos do movimento das Diretas Já, que aumentou a pressão pela volta das eleições diretas no ocaso do regime militar.
O evento reuniu convidados como a ministra Cármen Lúcia, do Supremo Tribunal Federal, o advogado Antonio Cláudio Mariz de Oliveira, a atriz Christiane Torloni, o jornalista Ricardo Kotscho e a cantora Fafá de Belém, que encerrou o seminário com uma performance do hino nacional.
"A OAB foi uma entidade política, porque interveio diretamente no debate, foi um ator importante, mas não politizada. Acho que essa é a grande lição sobre qual é o papel que a OAB pode ter", avalia. "Nós podemos fazer isso de novo, repetir essa experiência."
Os debates sobre a importância do direito ao voto escancaram, na avaliação da advogada, a fragilidade da democracia interna da OAB. O presidente nacional é eleito indiretamente, por meio dos conselheiros federais. A eleição direta para a presidência do Conselho Federal é uma das bandeiras de Patrícia.
"Nós percebemos que esse déficit de legitimidade faz com que as próprias posições da OAB Nacional percam a força, porque grande parte da advocacia não se identifica, então elas acabam tendo pouca expressão."
Leia a entrevista completa:
Juízes não são eleitos, embora tenham legitimidade garantida por outra via, a da Constituição. Como convencer dessa legitimidade a parcela da população que se opõe ao Supremo Tribunal Federal e ao seu papel contramajoritário justamente porque os ministros não foram escolhidos pelo voto popular?
O fato de os juízes não serem eleitos, embora em outros lugares do mundo seja diferente, é da tradição brasileira e, a meu ver, isso é adequado à nossa cultura. Não vejo problema. Há uma discussão sobre a forma mais democrática de constituição do Supremo, se deveria haver, por exemplo, mandatos. Mas isso é uma discussão mais restrita à composição do Supremo e não ao Judiciário como um todo. Na minha ótica, o Judiciário não ser eleito, não é um problema. Isso faz parte do sistema de freios e contrapesos, da função que cada poder exerce. E, como você disse, a função muitas vezes é contramajoritária, é assegurar o direito de minorias contra a vontade, eventualmente, da maioria. E, para isso, a gente tem uma baliza, que é a Constituição Federal.
CONTINUA APÓS PUBLICIDADE
As críticas que são feitas ao Judiciário devem ser endereçadas a exigir que o Judiciário cumpra a Constituição. O que eu acho que nós não podemos ter é um Judiciário inchado demais ou que extrapole o que está escrito na Constituição. É claro que a Constituição tem uma abertura interpretativa, mas as coisas ficam ruins quando o Judiciário não respeita o que está escrito na própria Constituição. Eu não sei se todas as críticas ao Judiciário provém dessa razão legítima. Eu acho que o Judiciário recebe algumas críticas pelo fato de por vezes desrespeitar a Constituição, e é para isso que existem os sistemas de recurso, mas recebe outras críticas porque desagrada a maioria. E, nesse caso, essa crítica é ilegítima, porque faz parte do Poder Judiciário, muitas vezes, desagradar a maioria para atender a direitos fundamentais. Então é preciso que a sociedade compreenda o papel do Judiciário e que o Judiciário também compreenda o seu próprio papel para não invadir a esfera de outros Poderes.
Como a senhora falou, a Constituição do Brasil é considerada extensa por juristas, o que abre espaço para uma ampla revisão constitucional das políticas públicas. Além disso, há um longo rol de atores legitimados a levarem disputas para o Poder Judiciário - e o STF em última instância - arbitrar. O seu vice (Leonardo Sica) defendeu a redução da competência criminal do STF. Considera essa uma boa saída?
Concordo com essa proposta. Acho que a competência, especificamente do Supremo Tribunal Federal, fica muito desvirtuada quando se atribui a ele a competência para julgar processos de réus que não têm foro por prerrogativa. Mesmo a questão do foro por prerrogativa de função é muito questionável. Acho que o Supremo deve ser uma Corte reservada a decidir questões constitucionais, não a decidir casos penais, que poderiam ser decididos em primeira instância.
A OAB esteve à frente das Diretas Já. Em 2022, apoiou a articulação do ato em defesa da democracia na USP. Isso para dar dois exemplos bastante separados no tempo. Em um momento em que a pauta da defesa da democracia foi politizada, qual é a importância da OAB inserida nesse debate?
Embora o contexto seja outro, e haja muitos desafios novos, relembrar o movimento das Diretas nos ensina duas coisas. Uma sobre a sociedade em geral, que é possível superar a polarização, uma atitude mais beligerante, uma atitude de ódio, em prol de uma posição mais construtiva que busque um denominador comum, que busque nossas convergências e não as nossas divergências. Nós podemos fazer isso de novo, repetir essa experiência. A segunda coisa que o movimento das Diretas nos ensina é a importância de uma entidade como a OAB, que possa congregar uma confluência suprapartidária. Foi isso que aconteceu no tempo das Diretas. A OAB foi uma entidade política, porque interveio diretamente no debate, foi um ator importante, mas não politizada. Acho que essa é a grande lição sobre qual é o papel que a OAB pode ter. Nós nos inspiramos nessas lideranças, em Mário Sérgio Duarte Garcia, Márcio Thomaz Bastos, Mariz de Oliveira, lideranças que conseguiram fazer da OAB essa entidade suprapartidária capaz de arregimentar várias forças sociais em prol de um objetivo comum do Estado brasileiro.
Estamos falando da importância do direito ao voto, mas a OAB ainda não tem eleições diretas para o Conselho Federal. Essa é uma bandeira que a senhora carrega desde a campanha. Há espaço para fazer esse debate avançar internamente?
Existem argumentos contrários que nós achamos que podem ser facilmente afastados. Há um temor de que a eleição fique desequilibrada, porque São Paulo teria mais peso do que as demais seccionais. Mas há muitas alternativas para que os advogados consigam eleger democraticamente o seu líder. Uma eleição proporcional, por exemplo. Nós percebemos que esse déficit de legitimidade faz com que as próprias posições da OAB Nacional percam a força, porque grande parte da advocacia não se identifica, então elas acabam tendo pouca expressão. E também os líderes, quando são eleitores, se sentem mais obrigados a corresponder ao desejo da base. Um líder que não é diretamente eleito se sente menos pressionado a atender os anseios legítimos da sua base. E eu acho que isso é muito ruim.

Article: A sede do diretório municipal do PSB em São Paulo, localizada na avenida Indianópolis, zona sul da capital, foi alvo de invasão na manhã de segunda-feira, 29. Os invasores arrombaram a porta da tesouraria da legenda e reviraram documentos no escritório da legenda. A notificação de ocorrência (conhecido como B.O.P.M) feita por policiais do 3º Batalhão de Polícia Militar que estiveram no local aponta para possível crime de furto.
As imagens enviadas ao Estadão mostram papéis espalhados por toda a parte, nas mesa se chão, gavetas abertas e a porta destruída. De acordo com a notificação de ocorrência, a PM recebeu um chamado às 8h54 de suposto furto, feito após uma funcionária encontrar documentos revirados e uma porta interna arrombada. Segundo os policiais que atenderam a ocorrência, apenas a porta da tesouraria do partido estava danificada, mas a entrada do diretório e também a do prédio onde ele está localizado estavam intactas.
O PSB pretende concorrer na disputa pela Prefeitura de São Paulo e tem como pré-candidata a deputada federal Tabata Amaral. Presidente da sigla na capital, a deputada ainda não se manifestou sobre o incidente.

A um dia de completar 27 anos, jogador segue desaparecido.
— Correio Braziliense (@correio) May 1, 2024
Um vídeo obtido com exclusividade pelo Correio mostra o jovem na moto em uma rua, por volta das 22h20 do dia 8, dia em que desapareceu. Na filmagem de seis segundos, Thavisson aparece sozinho. https://t.co/sPfj7grUBG pic.twitter.com/onFSnq2lDt
A família está desesperada sem notícias do jovem. Ao Correio, Ana Maria, irmã de Thavisson, pede celeridade nas investigações. “Quando vamos lá, e a fala é sempre a mesma. Que estão investigando e não tem mais informações. Queremos saber quem está por trás do desaparecimento dele”, desabafou.
Conforme o Correio revelou em primeira mão, a carteira de Thavisson foi encontrada um dia depois do desaparecimento, em uma chácara localizada no Setor Araguaias, no Novo Gama (GO). O suspeito de jogar a carteira pulou o muro da residência e caminhou pelo quintal. O Correio esteve no local e conversou com a dona da propriedade. Segundo ela, na madrugada de segunda para terça-feira, ela, a mãe e a irmã ouviram o barulho de alguém pulando o muro. “O muro é muito baixo, qualquer pessoa pode pular. Nós estávamos lá dentro e ficamos com muito medo. Só tem mulher aqui, então ficamos quietas e caladas”, afirmou à época da entrevista.
Buscas
Dois dias depois do sumiço do jogador, a moto dele foi localizada em uma área de mata, no Vale das Andorinhas, no Novo Gama. A região fica a cerca de 12km de distância da distribuidora de bebidas onde ocorreu a festa. Os familiares chegaram a receber a foto do automóvel pelas redes sociais, mas quando a polícia foi ao local averiguar, a moto já não estava mais lá. O caso é investigado pelo Grupo de Investigações de Homicídio (GIH) de Novo Gama.
Thavisson vestia bermuda vermelha e camisa branca. Quem tiver informações sobre o paradeiro do jovem, ligue para o número: (61) 98484-1747.

Article: Cinco pessoas morreram em meio aos fortes temporais que atingem o Rio Grande do Sul. De acordo com o Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet), o alerta de perigo para tempestades iniciado na segunda-feira, 29, permanece válido pelo menos até o início da noite de quinta-feira, 2.
Enquanto parte das regiões Sudeste e Centro-Oeste enfrentam onda de calor, no Estado do Sul o risco é de elevado volume de chuva. Ao menos 65 municípios já relataram danos, de acordo com a Defesa Civil do Estado gaúcho.
"Chuva entre 30 e 60 mm/h ou 50 e 100 mm/dia, ventos intensos e queda de granizo. Risco de corte de energia elétrica, estragos em plantações, queda de árvores e de alagamentos", alerta o instituto.
"Ocorreram também vendavais, descargas elétricas, movimentos de massa, queda de granizo, alagamentos em áreas urbanas e transbordamento de córregos, arroios e rios em diversos municípios e, ainda, interrupções de estradas em razão de queda de barreiras e outros danos", disse o órgão estadual.
Mortes
Dois óbitos foram registrados Paverama. Uma das vítimas era um homem de 69 anos que tentava atravessar, de carro, uma área alagada e o veículo teria sido arrastado pela força da correnteza. Havia outro ocupante no veículo, um homem de 65 anos, que estava desaparecido. Buscas seguiam sendo realizadas pelas forças de resposta na região. A Defesa Civil, em relatório preliminar, não confirmou se o segundo óbito é relativo ao que estava desaparecido.
A terceira morte aconteceu em Pântano Grande. Santa Maria e Encantado relataram uma morte em cada cidade, totalizando cinco vítimas em todo o Estado.
No Estado, há 242 pessoas em abrigos públicos e outras 95 desalojadas (que saíram de casa e procuraram abrigo em casas de parentes e amigos). As equipes da Defesa Civil estadual seguem apoiando as Coordenadorias Municipais de Proteção e Defesa Civil das cidades afetadas.
Por meio das redes sociais, o governador do Rio Grande do Sul, Eduardo Leite (PSDB), também alertou sobre a situação, inclusive pontuando o cenário até 3 de maio.
Rio Grande do Sul registrou 298 mil raios nesta segunda-feira
Ainda na manhã desta terça-feira, a MetSul Meteorologia emitiu informações sobre a quantidade raios sobre o Rio Grande do Sul: foram 298 mil registros ao longo da segunda-feira.
No Vale do Paranhana, um raio atingiu uma residência no município de Taquara na segunda-feira, deixando o imóvel parcialmente destruído por um incêndio. O casal e os dois filhos que habitavam a moradia não estavam em casa no momento em que se iniciou o fogo com a descarga atmosférica, de acordo com a empresa de meteorologia.
"A instabilidade que assola o Rio Grande do Sul é consequência de ar tropical quente, úmido e muito instável interagindo com uma frente semi-estacionária sobre o Estado, o que favorece a grande quantidade de descargas em muitas cidades gaúchas", afirma a MetSul Meteorologia. O alerta para a incidência de raios permanece até quinta-feira.

- Uso de IA no turismo ainda enfrenta desafios, diz diretor da Embratur
Segundo Marcio, em 2019, o governador de Goiás, Ronaldo Caiado, desafiou os secretários de Estado a desenvolver a modernização nas pastas. Como resultado, em conjunto com a Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), foi criado o Centro de Excelência em Inteligência Artificial (CEIA) que desenvolve soluções inovadoras de alto impacto, por meio do uso de dados e Inteligência Artificial. “Ele nos fez uma provocação de que pudéssemos desenvolver um estado mais moderno, em conjunto com a universidade montamos um centro de desenvolvimento, era um laboratório que inicialmente faturava R$ 10 milhões por ano, mas atualmente já fatura aproximadamente R$ 60 milhões por ano com o trabalho de 60 empresas e mais de 500 pesquisadores, sendo que 70% são bolsistas. Além disso, foi criado o primeiro curso de inteligência artificial do país em uma universidade com a primeira turma formada em 2023”, destacou.
A criação do Centro repercutiu na formação administrativa do governo de Goiás e um dos resultados foi a criação de um laboratório de inovação. “Isso repercutiu no estado em diversas ferramentas, como por exemplo com a criação do Laboratório de Inovação de Goiás (Ligo). Ele faz a relação entre diversas secretarias criando facilidades utilizando a inteligência artificial. O CEIA foi sempre o alicerce para montar isso. Por exemplo, onde podemos montar a blitz mais eficiente? A IA ajuda a fazer um mapeamento do estado para onde montar uma operação que tivesse mais resultados”, explicou.
O estado de Goiás busca continuar se movimentando com o uso das novas tecnologias. “Hoje a ideia é trabalhar para trazer cada vez mais a hiper automação dos nossos processos. Não só na parte de robôs, em que você vai usar para identificar melhor o conteúdo que você vai estar trabalhando e evoluir a técnica, mas usar a IA também para melhorar o framework do seu processo. Então a automação está cada vez mais interligada no nosso dia a dia”, exemplificou.
Márcio também levantou a provocação a respeito do armazenamento da quantidade de informações criadas no processo de desenvolvimento da inteligência artificial e como o governo pode gerir e arcar com custos desse processo. “Para ter uma boa IA é preciso ter um bom combustível, que é o dado. Dessa forma é preciso ter uma governança muito estruturada. Por isso, este ano formamos um comitê no governo constituído pelas principais secretarias que tem algo de relevante a contribuir nesse assunto. E também discutir o que você deve de fato guardar e gerir pois a tendência técnica é que você capture qualquer informação informação e comece a guardar. Mas as vezes é feito gasto de dinheiro público para guardar isso. Então a governança também serve pra isso, para saber fazer melhor o trabalho dentro de um ambiente com inteligência artificial.”
Além da questão de armazenamento, o subsecretário aponta que é necessário realizar um processo para ensinar as pessoas a fazerem o uso das ferramentas e dos dados. “O que também pesa muito nessa estrutura é que quando você vai trabalhar com dados você precisa fazer o letramento, é preciso ensinar para as pessoas a importância não só de manter aquilo mas de como usar aquela informação”.
Por fim, Marcio ainda destacou que é preciso regulamentar colocando metas e objetivos para o país. “O investimento é um ponto importante e o país precisa se voltar mais para isso, para formar essa estrutura. E acho que está faltando nessa regulamentação um pensamento também nessa linha. Regulamentar colocando metas claras para o Brasil alcançar e para que a IA seja de fato uma ferramenta para desenvolver a sociedade”, afirmou.

Article: O Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) adiou nesta terça-feira, 30, o julgamento que vai definir o futuro político do senador bolsonarista Jorge Seif (PL-SC). Ele é réu por abuso de poder econômico nas eleições de 2022 e pode ter o mandato cassado.
O ministro Floriano de Azevedo Marques, relator do processo, defendeu a conversão do julgamento em diligência para a complementação das provas do processo, o que na prática adia o desfecho da ação.
Para o ministro, há uma confusão nas provas, o que deixa "grande margem de dúvida" e impede uma "conclusão firme e segura" sobre o caso.
"Dadas as consequências graves de um aije (ação de investigação judicial eleitoral), a prova a embasar a decisão condenatória não pode ser aquela que torna apenas plausível a tese ventilada pelo representante. Há que se ter uma prova consistente."
O ministro culpou a Coligação Bora Trabalhar (PSD, Patriota e União Brasil), que deu entrada no processo contra o senador, o Ministério Público Eleitoral de Santa Catarina e a desembargadora Maria do Rocio, relatora do caso no Tribunal Regional Eleitoral, por "não desempenharem suficientemente o ônus e o encargo de perseguir a prova ampla e suficiente". "O que há é uma prova parcial e precariamente produzida."
O senador também foi alvo de críticas por mudar as justificativas ao longo do processo: "Não ajuda em nada a linha de defesa randômica."
Apenas o ministro Raul Araújo, corregedor da Justiça Eleitoral, divergiu da proposta. "Me parece que estaríamos, na verdade, reinstalando a instrução processo. Acho que não podemos chegar a tanto nesta sede de recurso."
Secretário Nacional da Pesca e Aquicultura no governo Jair Bolsonaro, Seif foi eleito senador em 2022, com 1.484.110 votos, o que representa 39,79% dos votos válidos. O segundo colocado teve 608.213 votos.
Se for condenado, Jorge Seif ainda pode recorrer ao próprio TSE e ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). Ele foi absolvido por unanimidade no Tribunal Regional Eleitoral em Santa Catarina.
Por que Jorge Seif é réu?
O senador é acusado de receber doações irregulares dos empresários Luciano Hang, dono da rede de lojas Havan, Osni Cipriani, da construção civil, e Almir Manoel Atanázio dos Santos, presidente do Sindicato das Indústrias de Calçados da cidade de São João Batista.
A legislação eleitoral proíbe o financiamento privado de campanha. As doações teriam sido feitas na forma de viagens em aeronaves da Havan e de Osni Cipriani, do uso da estrutura de comunicação da empresa de Luciano Hang para promover sua candidatura, além do financiamento de propaganda eleitoral pelo sindicato.
O Ministério Público Eleitoral (MPE) é a favor da condenação do senador. Em seu parecer, o vice-procurador Eleitoral Alexandre Espinosa Bravo Barbosa defendeu que as doações criaram "desigualdade de competição" em relação aos outros candidatos.
"Os fatos, que formam um conjunto (que não pode, nem deve ser avaliado isoladamente) reiterado de abuso de poder econômico vedado pela legislação eleitoral e que ocorreram no caso", diz a manifestação do MP.
Quais são as provas complementares exigidas pelo TSE?
O principal ponto de dúvida do TSE é sobre os voos custeados pela Havan. Por isso, os ministros decidiram notificar a rede para que apresente, em até 48 horas, os prefixos de todas as aeronaves usadas pela empresa ou que estivessem à disposição de Luciano Hang, entre janeiro de 2022 a março de 2023.
Com os dados em mãos, o Tribunal Superior Eleitoral vai solicitar aos aeródromos, aeroportos e helipontos das cidades por onde Jorge Seif passou na campanha para que compartilhem a lista de decolagens e aterrissagens.
"Para que esse tribunal possa emitir uma decisão condizente com a gravidade das penalidades previstas na legislação para a espécie, seja também para que possa dar por exercida sua jurisdição investigativa própria a uma aije, e concluir pela improcedência, é mister que se complemente a prova produzida nos autos", concluiu Floriano Marques.
O que o TRE decidiu?
O Tribunal Regional Eleitoral de Santa Catarina livrou o senador da ação, em novembro de 2023. Os desembargadores se dividiram em duas correntes. A primeira composta pelos que não viram provas "incontroversas" para embasar as acusações. A segunda considerou que, apesar da "transgressão", a normalidade das eleições não foi afetada. Todos votaram pela absolvição.
O que diz a defesa?
A defesa afirma que Jorge Seif é vítima de uma "narrativa especulada" e nega as acusações. "A prova que se pretendeu produzir veio negativa, mas a narrativa segue. É quase que uma desinformação processual", reagiu a advogada Maria Claudia Bucchianeri, que foi ministra do TSE, ao apresentar os argumentos finais.
Veja o que pesa contra Jorge Seif:
- Cessão de helicóptero de Osni Cipriani para deslocamentos na campanha;
- Uso da estrutura material e pessoal da Havan - transporte aéreo, canais oficiais da empresa para veiculação de campanha, sala de gravação de lives e vídeos para redes sociais e ocupação de funcionários;
- Financiamento de propaganda eleitoral pelo sindicato por meio da participação na 21ª Semana de Indústria Calçadista Catarinense, em São João Batista.

Article: O debate sobre inteligência artificial é um campo vasto que inclui diversas vertentes. Durante participação em painel do CB.Debate — Inteligência Artificial: os impactos no mercado brasileiro, realizado pelo Correio Braziliense com o apoio do Sebrae, o professor titular da Universidade de Brasília, Ricardo Queiroz, destacou que o uso de IA tem inúmeros objetos em legislação que necessitam ser debatidos.
“Em parâmetros de legislação, eu me preocuparia com os fakes”, diz Queiroz. Segundo o especialista, é preciso aprender a detectar e impedir a criação de textos, fotos e vídeos fakes. Os direitos autorais são outro ponto de atenção, tanto no treinamento, no uso de grandes bases de dados, quanto no que é gerado, no caso da criação de textos e músicas.
“Outro ponto é o viés. Dizem que a maioria dos vieses de treinamento são baseados em ocidentais, brancos e homens. Se quisermos desenviesar, precisamos mudar os dados”, explica o estudioso. A automação indiscriminada e o trabalho são outra vertente forte no debate. “Isso vai tirar o trabalho de um monte de gente, e ao contrário do que disseram, o primeiro trabalho que vai embora é dos programadores. Se as pessoas vão perder o emprego, quem vai dar dinheiro para elas? Como elas vão viver?”, indaga Queiroz.
Veja o evento na íntegra:
Políticas públicas
O consumo de energia pelas inteligências artificiais é um ponto de atenção. “Só para o Chat GPT fazer uma inferência, são 25 mil GPUs. Cada GPU custa USD 30 mil dólares, e elas consomem cerca de 700 Watts. Para cada Watt que se gasta na computação, tem que gastar mais um Watt, pelo menos, para resfriar a máquina. Isso é gigantesco”, observa o professor.
O assunto de posse de modelos, os chamados players, também se faz importante dentro do contexto. “Será que ficaremos apenas usuários? Quem irá gerar? Isso é um problema de política, será que o governo vai ter condição de lidar?”, pondera Queiroz.
Legislação
Durante o debate, Queiroz traz a tona recomendações do CEO da OpenAI, Sam Altman, sobre formas de como o uso da inteligência artificial deveria ser tratada dentro do âmbito político. “Agência governamental para licenciar modelos acima de determinado tamanho. Revogar licença se não aderir aos padrões de segurança, estes que devem proibir que ele se auto replique, fazer testes para saber se eles estão fazendo tudo o que está sendo pedido”, explica.
O uso do "AI Act" — "Ato de Inteligência Artificial", em tradução livre — é uma base defendida pelo estudioso para a medição dos problemas derivados do uso de IA. “Ele define todas as tecnologias em níveis de risco, onde há risco mínimo, risco limitado, alto risco e risco inaceitável, e o que se faz em cada um deles. Isso é o que está correndo pela União Europeia, mas é um modelo para quem estiver fazendo legislação dar uma olhada”, afirma Queiroz.
O professor acredita que esses pedidos devem ser feitos com auditoria, independente do governo e das empresas criadoras, mas, até o momento, o assunto não é de interesse do Congresso. “Nunca ninguém falou nada. Ninguém quer saber, ninguém está interessado”, conta.
O professor da UnB finaliza reiterando que o motivo pelo qual ainda é difícil trabalhar a regulação frente a um ambiente tão volátil onde há um crescimento exponencial de tecnologias, tamanho de modelos e complexidade.
“Como é muito rápido, é muito difícil precisar o que vai acontecer. Eu garanto que os arcabouços que nós temos hoje, não podem ser assim. Tem que ser algo mais dinâmico. Fazer essas mudanças em anos sobre um ciclo que muda em semanas é fadado ao insucesso”, finaliza Ricardo de Queiroz.

Nísia Trindade é dos poucos quadros técnicos do primeiro escalão do governo. Mesmo assim -ou talvez justamente por isso-, andou levando chumbo de setores do governo, do Congresso, da imprensa e até de Lula. Escrutinando as emendas liberadas recentemente para parlamentares, José Roberto de Toledo chega à razão da pressão sobre a ministra da Saúde. "As causas do tiroteio tinham pouco a ver com saúde pública. O motivo era o mesmo de sempre, dinheiro", diz o colunista.
R$ 7,6 bilhões da pasta foram empengados para senadores e deputados nas últimas duas semanas. E é surpreendente -ou não surpreende ninguém- a lista dos partidos que se beneficiaram mais. Vale muito ler a coluna.

Article: O avanço da tecnologia e, em particular, o papel da Inteligência Artificial (IA), estão moldando o futuro e as novas tecnologias do Brasil. Em participação no CB.Debate: Inteligência Artificial e as Novas Tecnologias, evento promovido pelo Correio Braziliense em parceria com o Sebrae, nesta terça-feira (30/4), Carlos Jacobino, fundador e sócio da holding ISG Participações e presidente do Sindicato das Indústrias da Informação do Distrito Federal (Sinfor-DF), provocou reflexões sobre a verdadeira natureza da IA e suas implicações na sociedade.
Jacobino apresenta como exemplo a capacidade da IA de diagnosticar condições médicas com maior precisão do que especialistas humanos. O presidente da Sinfor contou o caso de uma mulher cujas imagens de exames foram processadas por um algoritmo de IA, detectando um câncer de mama cinco anos antes do diagnóstico de médicos.
- "IA está redefinindo a forma de fazer negócio", destaca Carrijo, do Sebrae
- "Sou cético quanto à adoção em grande velocidade", diz Kubota sobre IA
- "Precisamos investir na educação", diz secretário do MCTI sobre IA
“A inteligência tem um potencial de transformação e impacto na vida das pessoas. Temos potenciais incríveis, principalmente, na área da saúde. Hoje, a inteligência artificial é capaz de fazer um diagnóstico de imagem. Olha o potencial que isso tem!”, contou.
De acordo com Jacobino, a empresa dele tem se esforçado para aplicar IA na prevenção do suicídio. Por meio de modelos psicométricos, a tecnologia é capaz de avaliar o risco de ideação suicida de indivíduos de forma mais precisa do que métodos convencionais. Ao contornar as limitações da avaliação humana, a IA pode identificar sinais precoces de problemas emocionais e psicológicos, potencialmente salvando vidas.
“Nós investimos em uma tecnologia de inteligência artificial que é capaz de prever a ideação suicida. Existem modelos psicométricos, que são capazes de analisar o nível de uma determinada patologia emocional ou psicológica, como ansiedade, desesperança, depressão e até ideação suicida”, observou. “Quando estamos passando por uma avaliação, respondemos o que achamos que é o correto e o que o outro quer ouvir e, não necessariamente, a verdade”, completou.
Por mais que haja desafios éticos associados à IA, como a disseminação de desinformação, especialmente durante períodos eleitorais, Jacobino enfatizou a importância de fundamentar o desenvolvimento tecnológico em princípios éticos, garantindo que a IA seja utilizada para o bem da sociedade. “Cabe a nós basearmos o que vamos escrever em pilares éticos e não em tecnologias”.
Jacobino fez uma provocação: "O que não é a inteligência artificial?". Inspirado nas palavras do cientista brasileiro Miguel Nicolelis, questionando a concepção comum de IA como algo "inteligente" e "artificial". A inteligência é uma propriedade inerente aos seres vivos, derivada de sua natureza orgânica e biológica. Esses sistemas simulam atividades realizadas por seres humanos, mas não possuem a verdadeira inteligência dos organismos vivos.
“A IA não é inteligente e nem artificial. Essa não é uma ideia minha, mas ele explica que a inteligência é uma propriedade dos seres vivos. A definição de um sistema especialista é um sistema que simula uma atividade que, geralmente, é feita por um ser humano”.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - O presidente dos EUA, Joe Biden, mantém uma vantagem marginal sobre Donald Trump para a eleição presidencial marcada para novembro, segundo uma pesquisa Reuters/Ipsos concluída nesta terça-feira, no momento em que o candidato republicano está enfurnado em um tribunal estadual combatendo acusações de ter falsificado registros comerciais.
Cerca de 40% dos eleitores registrados na pesquisa de dois dias disseram que votariam no democrata Biden se a eleição fosse realizada neste momento, enquanto 39% escolheriam o ex-presidente Trump. Essa vantagem de um ponto baixou de uma margem de quatro pontos a favor de Biden na pesquisa conduzida pela Reuters/Ipsos entre 4 e 8 de abril.
A pesquisa tem uma margem de erro de quase três pontos percentuais para eleitores registrados, sendo que muitos continuam indecisos a seis meses da eleição de 5 de novembro.
Aproximadamente 28% dos eleitores registrados da pesquisa disseram que não escolheram um candidato, estavam inclinados a votar em opções de outros partidos ou talvez nem votassem.
Oito por cento dos entrevistados escolheriam Robert Kennedy Jr., um ativista anti-vacinação concorrendo como independente, se ele estiver na cédula com Trump e Biden.
Embora pesquisas nacionais deem sinais importantes do apoio dos norte-americanos a candidatos políticos, apenas um punhado de estados geralmente influenciam a balança do colégio eleitoral dos EUA, que, em última análise, decide quem vence uma eleição presidencial.
Os dois candidatos possuem vulnerabilidades significativas para o que deve ser uma eleição acirrada, na primeira revanche em uma eleição presidencial em quase 70 anos.
Trump passou a maior parte de abril em um tribunal de Manhattan para o primeiro de quatro julgamentos criminais pendentes contra ele.
O julgamento em Manhattan envolve acusações de que Trump acobertou um pagamento a uma atriz de filmes adultos antes da eleição presidencial de 2016, em troca do silêncio da mulher sobre um suposto encontro sexual que teve com ele.
Segundo uma pesquisa anterior da Reuters/Ipsos, a maioria dos norte-americanos considera as acusações sérias. Trump se declarou inocente e nega ter tido qualquer encontro do tipo.
Os outros julgamentos envolvem acusações de que Trump tentou reverter a derrota eleitoral de 2020 ou que ele lidou irregularmente com documentos sensíveis após deixar a presidência em 2021. Trump se declarou inocente de todas as acusações.
As vulnerabilidades de Biden incluem preocupações com sua idade -- 81 anos -- e fortes críticas de uma parcela do Partido Democrata pelo seu apoio à guerra de Israel contra militantes do Hamas.
Trump, 77 anos, teve uma vantagem de dois pontos percentuais em relação a Biden entre todos os entrevistados para a pesquisa, mas a liderança de Biden entre eleitores registrados é significativa porque é mais provável que quem já está registrado para votar o faça em novembro. Apenas dois terços dos eleitores elegíveis compareceram às urnas na eleição presidencial de 2020, na qual Biden derrotou Trump.
Trump liderou entre os entrevistados do sexo masculino por 41% a 35%, enquanto Biden levou vantagem entre as mulheres, por 35% a 33%. Trump liderou entre os entrevistados sem diploma universitário. Biden liderou entre os que possuem um diploma.

Article: O ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad, agradeceu o Congresso Nacional pela aprovação do Programa Emergencial de Retomada do Setor de Eventos (Perse) com a limitação de gastos em R$ 15 bilhões até 2026. A aprovação simboliza mais uma vitória da equipe econômica, que queria revogar o benefício criado durante a pandemia de covid-19 para os setores de eventos e turismo, mas enfrentou resistência dos parlamentares, o fez com que o governo recuasse e apresentasse um caminho alternativo, com a limitação do escopo para o programa.
“Quero agradecer mais uma vez à Câmara e ao Senado pelo fato de terem aprovado essa restrição que foi feita ao Perse, com regras que filtram o programa, estabelecem uma governança e o colocam dentro do orçamento. Agora temos um programa com renúncia de R$ 5 bilhões por ano”, disse em coletiva de imprensa nesta terça-feira (30/4), em São Paulo.
Haddad afirmou que o governo ter recorrido ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) enquanto as negociações políticas sobre os temas ainda estavam em curso foi "um erro". “Eu agradeço tanto ao Arthur Lira (presidente da Câmara) como ao Rodrigo Pacheco (presidente do Senado), que disciplinaram e moralizaram um programa que estava dando muito problema, não por culpa do Congresso, mas porque o desenho permitia que ele fosse burlado e isso foi definitivamente corrigido.”
O ministro disse ainda que a judicialização foi motivada por pareceres jurídicos e reforçou a relação entre o Executivo e o Legislativo. “A gente vai aprender com o episódio, estamos sempre abertos a aperfeiçoar a nossa relação. O governo não tem dificuldade de relacionamento com as duas casas, muito pelo contrário. Estamos construindo essa agenda, mas há atos vinculantes”, afirmou.

Article: Na noite desta terça-feira (30), o Bahia derrotou o Criciúma por 1 a 0, pelo jogo de ida da terceira fase da Copa do Brasil, em Salvador. Dessa forma, o Tricolor Baiano saiu na frente na eliminatória e joga pelo empate, dentro de três semanas, para se classificar às oitavas de final. Thaciano foi o autor do único gol da equipe da casa.
Primeiro tempo
A primeira etapa foi de amplo domínio do Bahia, que apertou o quanto pôde o Criciúma em seu campo de defesa. Antes dos primeiros dez minutos, Everton Ribeiro e Thaciano já tinham passado perto do gol, desperdiçando boas oportunidades. O goleiro Gustavo segurou o ímpeto da equipe da casa e, antes do intervalo, Thaciano e Everaldo também tiveram chances, respectivamente numa cabeçada e num chute, que também foram para fora.
Segundo tempo
Apostando nos contra-ataques, o Criciúma quase não levava perigo à baliza do goleiro baiano Marcos Felipe. Dessa forma, o time da casa aproveitou e saiu na frente aos 11 minutos. Arias fez boa jogada pelo lado direito e cruzou para Thaciano escorar e fazer 1 a 0. Ainda muito recuado, o Criciúma não tinha chances e o Bahia, por sua vez, começou a desperdiçar gols. Arias e Ademir chutaram para boas defesas de Gustavo, que voltou a trabalhar numa linda intervenção, após chute de De Pena.
A única oportunidade dos visitantes veio numa cabeçada de Marquinhos Gabriel, que passou à direita de Marcos Felipe. No finalzinho, Estupiñán, de cabeça, quase marcou o segundo, mas novamente Gustavo fez a defesa, para manter o Tigre vivo na disputa para o jogo de volta.

Article: O Botafogo lançou, nesta terça-feira (30), sua nova camisa 1 para a temporada 2024/25, em parceria com a Reebok, fornecedora esportiva desde o ano passado e com contrato até 2025. A temática dos novos modelos da empresa norte-americana é “Passado, presente e futuro”, cada qual marcando uma época diferente do clube.
O Glorioso, aliás, lançará os modelos 2 e 3 nos próximos meses.
A camisa tradicional alvinegra conta com gola em V, com detalhes em preto e branco, assim como na barra das mangas. As listras têm triângulos nas laterais. O manto alvinegro remete a um modelo retrô.
Nas costas, as listras não invadem o quadrado preto, reservado para os números na camisa utilizada, algo que o clube adota desde 2023.
O clube também divulgou os uniformes de treino e aquecimento para a temporada. Veja abaixo!

Article: Em busca de sua segunda decisão de Champions, o PSG sonha com a primeira conquista no torneio. Mas precisará superar o Borussia Dortmund na semifinal. Devido ao grande investimento no elenco, a equipe francesa é vista como favorita no duelo.
O técnico Luis Enrique, contudo, não compartilha do mesmo entendimento. E não perdeu a oportunidade de fazer críticas à imprensa.
“(Risos) Viu? É por isso que a imprensa não sabe quase nada sobre futebol. Esse é o meu argumento há muito tempo. O bom de estar aqui é desfrutar de um jogo muito especial, em um campo que eu diria que é único na Europa, e ter a possibilidade de alegrar os torcedores ao se classificar para a final. Foi isso que conquistamos com os jogos anteriores e é isso que vamos tentar aproveitar”, disse, em entrevista coletiva antes da partida de ida na Alemanha desta quarta-feira (1º).
Paris Saint-Germain e Borussia Dortmund voltam a se enfrentar nesta Champions após serem rivais na fase de grupos. Houve, aliás, um triunfo dos franceses e um empate.
Apesar do resultado negativo, os alemães ainda conseguiram terminar na liderança do grupo, com 11 pontos contra oito dos aurinegros.

Article: Internacional e Juventude se enfrentam nesta quarta-feira (1), pelo jogo de ida da terceira fase da Copa do Brasil. O jogo ocorrerá às 21h30 (de Brasília), no estádio Beira-Rio, en Porto Alegre (RS). Este confronto é uma repetição da semifinal do Campeonato Gaúcho deste ano. Na competição estadual, o Juventude saiu vitorioso nos pênaltis,, quando o zagueiro Robert Renan falhou ao tentar uma cobrança de cavadinha.
Onde Assistir
A partida terá transmissão do streaming Amazon Prime Vídeo.
Como chega o Internacional
O Internacional entra em campo sob pressão devido às suas performances abaixo do esperado sob a direção de Eduardo Coudet. Após o empate com o Atlético-GO, na Série A, onde a equipe conquistou apenas sete pontos até agora, o treinador fez algumas cobranças à torcida. Atualmente, o Colorado ocupa a sexta posição na tabela.
É provável que Coudet enfrente críticas vindas da torcida presente no Beira-Rio. Sendo assim, a única forma de aplacar essas críticas seria através de uma vitória convincente com uma margem de gols considerável.
Como chega o Juventude
Por outro lado, o Juventude está preocupado após sofrer uma derrota expressiva para o Botafogo. A equipe, em resumo, vem de um empate em casa com o Athletico-PR no último fim de semana e ocupa a 13ª posição no Brasileirão.
O técnico Roger Machado, por fim, indicou que um empate seria bem recebido, considerando a importância da decisão da vaga que ocorrerá em Caxias do Sul.

Article: O Corinthians tem a receber um valor milionário pela venda do atacante Malcom para o Al-Hilal, da Arábia Saudita. O jogador, negociado pelo Zenit, da Rússia, à equipe do Oriente Médio, ainda tinha uma porcentagem de seus direitos econômicos ao Timão, que aguarda o dinheiro da transação cair em sua conta. Ao todo, o clube tem R$ 9,03 milhões a receber pela negociação.
De acordo com o balanço financeiro do Corinthians, divulgado nesta terça-feira (30), o clube ainda tem valores a receber dos dois clubes envolvidos na transação por Malcom. O Zenit deve R$ 1,68 milhão, enquanto o Hilal deve R$ 7,35 milhões. Estes valores equivalem a 2,5% do total do negócio entre os clubes, garantido ao Timão pelo mecanismo de solidariedade da Fifa.
Em julho de 2023, o Zenit vendeu Malcom para o Al-Hilal por 60 milhões de euros (R$ 315 milhões). Revelado pelo Corinthians, o atacante, hoje com 28 anos, foi inicialmente vendido ao Bordeaux, da França. Posteriormente, foi para o Barcelona e, em seguida, para o Zenit. Assim, sua oportunidade no Hilal representa a primeira chance em uma equipe do futebol asiático. Pelo Timão, o atacante disputou 60 jogos, marcou dez gols e foi campeão brasileiro em 2015.

Article: Tudo igual em Ponta Grossa. O Grêmio visitou o Operário nesta terça-feira pelo jogo de ida da terceira fase da Copa do Brasil 2024, mas as equipes empataram no Estádio Germano Krüger. Em jogo equilibrado, com chances para os dois lados, ninguém balançou as redes e a partida terminou em 0 a 0.
Dessa forma, com o resultado, a definição da vaga para as oitavas de final fica para o duelo de volta. Quem vencer se classifica e segue no torneio. Em caso de qualquer empate, a classificação será definida nos pênaltis, afinal o critério do gol fora de casa deixou de valer.
Primeiro tempo
Os donos da casa tiveram mais posse de bola na etapa inicial, mas foi o Grêmio quem chegou com mais perigo. O time gaúcho assustou primeiro na bola parada, com Gustavo Martins de cabeça após cobrança de escanteio, mas o goleiro Rafael Santos fez boa defesa. As melhores escapadas do Tricolor eram com Galdino, que se movimentou bastante. Já na reta final, Cristaldo recebeu de Galdino em profundidade e tentou de carrinho, mas não conseguiu tocar com força na bola. Na sequência, Diego Costa limpou a marcação e tocou para Cristaldo bater forte. A bola, contudo, bateu na rede pelo lado de fora.
Segundo tempo
Se o Operário assustou pouco no primeiro tempo, a segunda etapa começou diferente. Logo com um minuto, Cássio Gabriel, que entrou no intervalo, recebeu de Ronaldo e ficou cara a cara, mas mandou por cima. O Grêmio tentou assumir as rédeas da partida na sequência, porém sem muito sucesso. O Fantasma voltou a levar perigo aos 19, após jogada pela direita. Cássio Gabriel cruzou na segunda trave, e Maxwell, sozinho, cabeceou na trave. A bola bateu em Edenílson e voltou nas mãos de Caíque. A arbitragem, porém, assinalou impedimento em lance que foi ajustado e iria para o VAR caso entrasse. O técnico Renato mexeu no time e colocou Nathan Fernandes, que melhorou o poder de fogo gremista. Ele fez jogada pela direita e chutou para o meio em lance que quase acabou em gol contra, mas o goleiro Rafael defendeu. No fim, as duas equipes se resguardaram.
Sequência
Operário e Grêmio voltam a se enfrentar na Copa do Brasil somente no dia 22 de maio, em Porto Alegre. No fim de semana, pelo Campeonato Brasileiro, o Fantasma encara o Vila Nova pela Série B, enquanto o Imortal tem compromisso com o Criciúma pela Série A.

Article: O confronto entre Internacional e Juventude, previsto para esta quarta-feira (1º), às 21h30 (de Brasília), pode sofrer alteração na data. Na véspera do jogo, o Governo do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul solicitou o adiamento em razão das fortes chuvas que acometem a cidade de Porto Alegre.
Na carta com envio à Federação Gaúcha de Futebol (FGF), o Governo também levou em consideração para o pedido de adiamento a previsão de temporais para os próximos dias. O documento, aliás, foi assinado pelo Coronel Luciano Chaves Boeira, da Casa Militar.
De acordo com o governador Eduardo Leite, já houve registro mais de 300 milímetros de chuva desde a última semana, além da previsão de mais 400 mm até sexta-feira.
Juventude já retornou para Caxias do Sul
Além disso, a delegação do Juventude precisou retornar de ônibus para Caxias do Sul após problemas nas estradas até a capital gaúcha. Afinal, houve queda de uma barreira durante o trajeto.
“Em virtude das fortes chuvas que atingem o Rio Grande do Sul, o Juventude encontra dificuldades para se descolar até Porto Alegre. Após uma queda de barreira entre Boa Vista do Sul e Teutônia, a delegação do clube retorna neste momento para Caxias do Sul”, disse o clube, em nota oficial.
Espera-se um anúncio da CBF nas próximas horas, com um provável adiamento do duelo pela terceira fase da Copa do Brasil. Até o momento, houve a confirmação de cinco mortes e mais de 18 desaparecidos em razão das fortes chuvas, segundo a Defesa Civil do estado.

Article: João Vianney*
O Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais (Inep), órgão vinculado ao Ministério da Educação (MEC), publicou estudo recente mostrando que faltam professores habilitados para a docência na educação básica em todas as regiões do país. Norte e Nordeste são as regiões com maior necessidade. As piores condições estão na Bahia e no Maranhão.
Apesar deste cenário de alerta ter sido divulgado em dezembro de 2023, em abril deste ano o Conselho Nacional de Educação (CNE) aprovou a resolução 4/2024, que, se homologada pelo MEC, inviabiliza a oferta de cursos de licenciatura pela educação a distância (EaD), agravando o problema.
O risco é iminente para aumentar o grau de apagão de professores na educação básica, pois a formação por EaD responde por 93,7% dos ingressantes nessa área no ensino privado, e por 22,2% dos calouros no ensino público.
Apagão de professores
A conclusão da análise publicada no Caderno de Estudos do INEP foi realizada a partir dos indicadores do Censo da Educação Básica de 2010 a 2021 e do Censo do Ensino Superior de 2022. O estudo diz que “os contingentes de licenciados nos períodos considerados são menores do que os das respectivas demandas total e imediata de professores em várias áreas do conhecimento nas unidades federativas”.
O artigo intitulado Carência de professores na educação básica: risco e apagão? foi escrito pelos especialistas Alvana Maria Bof, Luiz Zalaf Caseiro, e Fabiano Mundim. Os dados revelam o deficit entre a quantidade de professores necessários e o número de diplomados a cada ano que se dedicam para atuar nas disciplinas das séries finais do ensino fundamental e matérias do ensino médio.
Séries finais do ensino fundamental
O quadro mais grave está nas regiões Norte e Nordeste, onde apenas 47,4% e 46,5% dos professores que atuam nas séries finais do ensino fundamental têm formação adequada na área. Em seguida, o Centro-Oeste, com 65,8%, e as regiões Sul e Sudeste em melhor condição, com 69,9% e 70,8%, respectivamente.
Esse cenário mostra que, se o MEC restringir a oferta de licenciaturas por EaD, as regiões mais penalizadas seriam Norte e Nordeste, justo as duas que mais precisam avançar na atuação de professores com a licenciatura apropriada.
Atuação no ensino médio
Os registros para os professores com atuação no ensino médio também mostram o ranking por regiões: Nordeste com 63,4%, Norte com 66,2% e Centro-Oeste com 66,3% de atuação com professores habilitados. São as três regiões com maiores necessidades a suprir.
Em seguida, em melhores condições, porém ainda deficitárias, estão as regiões Sudeste, com 69,0%, e Sul, com 72,4%.
Como fica o apagão por disciplina?
Ao fazer a análise por disciplina ministrada, o estudo do INEP apontou que nas séries finais do Ensino Fundamental as maiores lacunas estão em literatura, onde faltam 54,5% do contingente docente com a respectiva habilitação, e artes, com falta de 51,4%.
Em seguida ficam as disciplinas de geografia e matemática, com as lacunas de 35,9% e de 34,7%, respectivamente. em ciências, a falta de professores habilitados chega a 30%.
Quando observados os componentes das séries finais do ensino fundamental e as matérias do ensino médio, as maiores carências estão em sociologia e língua estrangeira, com apenas 39,3% e 43,3% de professores habilitados em sala de aula.
Depois, vêm filosofia e física, com 53,3% e 54,0% de adequação entre a formação dos professores e a oferta em sala de aula. língua portuguesa, educação física e história são as matérias com os maiores índices de alinhamento entre formação e docência, com 85,8%, 82%, e 81,2%.
Estados em pior situação
Na comparação feita pelo Inep para verificar as carências na formação por unidade da Federação, o estudo aponta que o pior cenário da análise era para ter professores habilitados na disciplina de física, com 16 estados nessa condição.
Em seguida, veio a falta de professores habilitados para língua estrangeira (15 estados); sociologia e filosofia (11 estados); matemática (10 estados); e biologia/ciências (8 estados).
Os estados em pior condição eram a Bahia e o Maranhão, sem ter como equalizar professores habilitados para dez disciplinas. Em seguida, vieram o Amazonas (8 disciplinas), Acre e Tocantins (7 disciplinas), Pernambuco e Mato Grosso (6 disciplinas), Goiás e Santa Catarina (5 disciplinas).
MEC pode piorar o apagão
Os dados do Inep indicam claramente que a prioridade nacional a ser observada pelo CNE e pelo MEC deveria ser a de um investimento para aumentar a oferta e a taxa de conclusão nos cursos de licenciatura, e não focar na redução da oferta. Esse é o posicionamento da diretoria da Associação Brasileira de Educação a Distância, a Abed.
Os municípios mais ao interior e as regiões com maior concentração de pobreza concentram os alunos mais vulneráveis à falta de professores habilitados, revela a publicação do Inep. No entanto, desde o segundo semestre de 2023, o ministro da Educação vem se pronunciando contra a EaD. Ora ataca o crescimento da modalidade – que já é a preferida pelos calouros –, ora está contra uma suposta falta de qualidade, condição esta refutada pelos indicadores do Inep.
O paradoxo de interesse nacional é que o cenário dos discursos do MEC e do conteúdo da Resolução 4/2024 do CNE afrontam a realidade, pois os estudos do Inep mostram que já entramos em um apagão de professores na educação básica. Ou seja, a iniciativa do CNE, se assumida pelo MEC, piora o quadro que já é de falta de mestres habilitados para a docência básica.

Article: No fim da tarde desta terça-feira (30) foi publicado, em edição extra do Diário Oficial, o decreto de emergência para Síndromes Respiratórias Agudas Graves (SRAG) em Campo Grande. Os casos já lotam hospitais e unidades de saúde. A ocupação de leitos está em 100% no sistema público de saúde.
De acordo com a publicação, o período de emergência se estende por 90 dias na Capital. Dentro de 24h, do dia 29 a 30 de abril, foram confirmadas 4 mortes por Influenza A, totalizando 5 mortes no município neste ano.
A secretária Rosana Leite afirma que a recomendação da Secretaria Municipal de Saúde (Sesau) é o uso de máscara, lavagem das mãos e álcool para prevenção do contágio pela gripe. O vírus sincicial respiratório, responsável pelo maior número de casos hoje na Capital, sobrevive por várias horas no ambiente e nas superfícies de uso coletivo, sendo necessário o uso de álcool.
Rosana Leite ainda afirma a importância do decreto para o abastecimento da saúde pública: "Quando nós fazemos uma declaração, além da população entender melhor, se proteger mais, como as mães evitarem saírem muito com os bebezinhos, para eles não adquirem esse vírus, nós também temos a possibilidade de fazer compras dos nossos insumos, dos nossos medicamentos e leitos mais rápido".
De acordo com a Sesau, de janeiro até abril foram confirmados 1033 casos de SRAG, com o agravante de que o período de internação aumentou em relação ao ano passado. Um paciente que ficava internado cinco dias, passou a ficar 15 dias no hospital por conta da gripe.
Unidades de Saúde
O número de atendimentos nas Unidades de Pronto Atendimento (UPAs) também alertou a Secretaria de Saúde. Na segunda-feira passada (22), o atendimento foi de três mil pacientes. Nesta segunda (29), o número foram registrados mais de cinco mil atendimentos em Campo Grande. Por isso, o Centro de Operação de Emergências (COE), para situações epidemiológicas, já foi ativado.
Rosana Leite afirma que o atendimento nas UPAS tem hoje uma espera mínima de mais de duas horas, podendo chegar a quatro horas. "Essa média é maior entre os pacientes classificados como verde e azul. Nós já aumentamos um médico em todas as nossas unidades para atendimento e dois médicos na unidade da UPA-Leblon, onde tem maior número de atendimento. Fortalecemos também número de enfermeiros e técnicos para classificação de risco e já estamos pensando em outras estratégias para outros profissionais".
Sobre os leitos de Campo Grande, as alas vermelha e amarela e a CTI pediátrica estão operando acima da capacidade. No Hospital Regional, por exemplo, a capacidade era de seis leitos e, nesta semana, 17 pacientes estão internados, sendo quatro entubados.
Durante coletiva de imprensa sobre o decreto de emergência nesta terça-feira (30), a prefeitura afirmou que está em tratativas com a Santa Casa para aumento de leitos no período emergencial.
Vacinação
De acordo com a Sesau, as principais síndromes respiratórias são: vírus sincicial respiratório; Influenza A; Rinovírus e Covid. A tendência para os próximos dias é o aumento de até 95% do número de casos.
A titular da saúde, Rosa Leite, reforça a necessidade da vacinação, que só atingiu 17% do público-alvo em Campo Grande.
"É importantíssimo a gestante se vacinar, porque os estudos mostram que a partir do momento que ela se vacina, principalmente no último trimestre, ela passa os anticorpos para o bebê. O vírus sincicial respiratório, por frente da influenza, é um vírus que 100% das crianças até os 4 anos terão contato. Porém, a gente sabe que o sistema imunológico fica mais completo a partir do segundo ano. Para a gente, ele não faz nada, mas para o bebê ele pode ser fatal".
Podem se vacinar:
- Todas as crianças abaixo de 6 anos;
- Idosos, acima de 65 anos;
- Pessoas com comorbidades;
- Pessoas com deficiência;
- Indígenas, não-aldeados, aldeados e quilombolas;
- Gestantes e puérperas.
Além das unidades básicas de saúde durante a semana, imunizante da gripe pode ser encontrado em shoppings e unidades especiais aos sábados e domingos.

A esteticista comentou sobre o jogo e reclamou: "De jogo, está tudo certo. O negócio é falar que uma pessoa roubou uma coisa".
Cibelle a interrompeu: "Hora que chegar, você fala para quem achou, você conta essa mesma historinha.
Nathana se defendeu: "Uma coisa que é do geral aqui não tem como roubar. Roubar é pegar alguma coisa da sua bolsa, botar na minha e levar embora para a minha casa". A gerente comercial retrucou: "Eu não nasci ontem".
Ana Paula se intrometeu e criticou Cibelle. Ela apontou que a vileira foi errada de levantar o assunto antes de os participantes disputarem a prova da Zona de Risco.
Aos gritos, Nathana disparou: "Você ficou p*ta porque foi para a Zona de Risco e quis causar... se você falou de roubo, você vai ser processada. Vou pegar os vídeos".
Cibelle ainda apontou que a "batata dela estava assando". No final da discussão, a chamou de louca e disse que ela estaria na próxima Zona de Risco.

Article: (AEN) A Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (Anvisa) publicou neste mês uma resolução que proíbe a fabricação, importação, comercialização, distribuição, armazenamento, transporte e propaganda de dispositivos eletrônicos para fumar, popularmente conhecidos como cigarros eletrônicos ou “vapes”. No Paraná, a Secretaria de Estado da Saúde (Sesa) reforça os malefícios que o hábito pode causar, principalmente na faixa etária de 18 a 24 anos, idades com maiores prevalências.
Os cigarros eletrônicos com nicotina são prejudiciais à saúde e causam dependência. Embora seus efeitos de saúde a longo prazo não sejam totalmente conhecidos, já se sabe que eles liberam substâncias tóxicas que são cancerígenas ou aumentam o risco de doenças cardíacas e pulmonares. Além disso, podem afetar o desenvolvimento cerebral e causar distúrbios de aprendizagem em jovens. A exposição do feto aos cigarros eletrônicos utilizados pela mãe pode prejudicar seu desenvolvimento.
No âmbito do tratamento da dependência de nicotina, o Programa Nacional de Controle do Tabagismo (PNCT), por meio da Rede de Referências Estaduais, desenvolve atividades de apoio, como a capacitação de profissionais para a abordagem mínima, que deve ocorrer em todos os atendimentos de saúde.
O Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) disponibiliza, gratuitamente, o acesso ao programa de tratamento, o qual é realizado pela abordagem cognitivo-comportamental, material de apoio e, quando houver indicação, tratamento medicamentoso com terapia de reposição de nicotina (TRN), pelos adesivos transdérmicos/goma de mascar e do tratamento não nicotínico com cloridrato de bupropiona. Todo tratamento ofertado está baseado em evidências científicas, no qual os usuários são acompanhados até um ano.
Para quem precisa de ajuda para parar de fumar a Sesa orienta procurar uma Unidade de Saúde para o tratamento. Ele é gratuito e está disponível em 75% dos municípios paranaenses. Essas unidades contam, ao menos, com uma equipe que oferta tratamento do tabagismo, tanto nas Unidades de Saúde da Atenção Primária, como na Atenção Especializada. Os endereços podem ser consultados AQUI.
“Essa decisão da Anvisa, que precisa de ampla publicidade, reforça a necessidade de intensificar a fiscalização e as campanhas de conscientização, com apoio de toda a comunidade, visando a não experimentação e a divulgação dos malefícios dos DEFs”, ressalta a chefe da Divisão de Prevenção e Controle de Doenças Crônicas e Tabagismo da Secretaria da Saúde, Rejane Cristina Teixeira Tabuti.
“Existe tratamento, mas as pessoas precisam compreender que sofrem de uma dependência química. Sabemos das dificuldades de iniciativa para procurar o tratamento, mas parar de fumar a qualquer tempo traz benefícios”, complementa.
PROIBIÇÃO – A proibição dos DEFs está em vigor desde 2009, por meio da Resolução da Diretoria Colegiada da Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (Anvisa) – RDC nº 46, de 28 de agosto de 2009, o que foi confirmado pela
de abril deste ano. De acordo com a Organização Pan-Americana da Saúde (Opas), em dezembro do ano passado 34 países proibiam a venda, 88 países não estipulavam idade mínima para venda e 74 não tinham regulamentação sobre esses produtos.De acordo com a coordenadora da Vigilância Sanitária da Sesa, Luciane Otaviano de Lima, a nova decisão não se aplica apenas aos DEFs, mas também a todos os acessórios, peças, partes e refis.
“É uma regulamentação importante e que deve ser seguida. Também é importante lembrar que o uso de qualquer dispositivo fumígeno é proibido em ambiente coletivo fechado desde 1996, conforme previsto na Lei Federal nº 9.294/1996 e a Lei Estadual nº 16.239/2009, que estabelece normas de proteção à saúde e de responsabilidade para criação de ambientes de uso coletivo livres de produtos fumígenos”, acrescenta.
O não cumprimento da resolução constitui infração sanitária, sujeitando os infratores às penalidades das Leis nº 9.294/1996 e nº 6.437/1977, que incluem advertência, interdição, recolhimento e multa, entre outras, e demais sanções aplicáveis, sem prejuízo das responsabilidades civil, administrativa e penal cabíveis.
Na hipótese de ser identificada infração sanitária decorrente do descumprimento da legislação, a norma prevê ainda que a Vigilância Sanitária municipal, estadual ou a Anvisa, conforme competência de cada esfera, fará a imediata comunicação ao órgão do Ministério Público da respectiva localidade, para fins de eventual instauração do procedimento de apuração cível e criminal do fato.

A decisão foi publicada pelo Tribunal de Justiça mineiro e impede que o município "faça qualquer pagamento ou outra transferência de recursos para custeio dos shows das duplas", envolvendo as empresas responsáveis pelas contratações dos artistas.
De acordo com o Ministério Público, os contratos dos sertanejos envolviam ao total R$ 543 mil, sendo R$353 mil de César Menotti e Fabiano, e R$ 190 mil de Gian e Giovani.
O pedido da ação foi feito pelo Ministério Público e cita que a prefeitura diz não ter recursos para implantar um sistema de tratamento de esgoto, que "vem causando degradação e poluição do meio ambiente, além de prejudicar a saúde da população".
O promotor Vinícius de Souza Chave afirma que o valor dos contratos deveriam garantir primeiro a efetivação de direitos fundamentais dos cidadãos.

Article: Virgínia Fonseca, 25, causou furor nas redes sociais ao exibir o antes e o depois de um 'banho' de maquiagem.
O que aconteceu
A esposa de Zé Felipe, 24, começou exibindo o próprio rosto ao natural, sem make, com algumas espinhas bastante visíveis no queixo e na bochecha. "A transformação já vem aí", 'avisou' a influenciadora, na legenda da foto, publicada nos stories de seu Instagram.
Minutos depois, Virgínia publicou um segundo clique, no qual aparece deslumbrantemente maquiada e produzida. "Veio aí! Bora começar! Que Deus abençoe", legendou ela, sinalizando haver cumprido a promessa do post anterior.
Em ambos registros, a apresentadora do Sabadou com Virgínia (SBT) aparecia trajando o mesmo roupão preto, com a logo da WePink, sua própria marca de cosméticos. A empresa lucrou R$ 160 milhões apenas nos últimos cinco meses de 2023.

Article: Quando o norte-americano Ernest Hemingway visitou Paris, escreveu que a capital francesa era um lugar onde as festas aconteciam constantemente e que seus impactos o marcariam para sempre.
A mais de nove mil quilômetros dali, uma festa mensal em outra Paris também impactou o casal Cunha, 41, e Micheliny, 38, que pela primeira vez experimentou o swing e saiu de lá com o casamento de sete anos cheio de tesão.
"Transamos ao lado de um casal. Deixamos ela gozar primeiro, saímos do quarto e, quando voltamos, gozamos também", descreve a técnica de informática, de 38 anos.
A dupla escolheu a Noite para Iniciantes do Paris Café Swing Clube, na Barra da Tijuca, zona oeste do Rio de Janeiro, para apimentar a relação. Há 20 anos funcionando no último andar de uma boate de cinco lances de escada, a festa voltada para os debutantes no sexo liberal acontece uma vez por mês no local.
Esta é uma reportagem da série publicada pelo Aba Anônima contando o que rola nas casas de swing pelo Brasil.
"Piscina é uma putaria só"
O promoter Elias Pontes, 55, começou no mundo liberal há duas décadas, a convite de uma namorada. Conta ele que na época não conhecia casas de swing até falar para a parceira que queria fazer um ménage. A condição dela era que os dois transassem com homens e mulheres, sem tabus. E rolou num espaço que nem existe mais, na zona sul.
"Naquela época aconteciam mais festinhas organizadas por grupos de aplicativos como MSN", ele lembra.
No Carnaval de 2004, Elias teve a ideia de "juntar a fome com a vontade de comer" e passou a oferecer seus serviços de promoter em boates. E desde então produz os encontros de casais no local, com dia específico só para iniciantes:
"Faço uma vez por mês para iniciantes e não permito nunca a entrada de solteiro. Aqui é apenas casal e solteira."
O espaço oferece duas grandes suítes no salão interno, que tem ainda um american bar e pole dance. Na área externa, um dark room. Mas as dependências são abertas somente após a 0h, quando rolam dois shows de strip - masculino e feminino. Até lá, as trocas são mais contidas, com mulheres subindo uma a saia da outra, beijos triplos e homens tocando os seios de suas companheiras.
Tem ainda um glory hole um andar abaixo e um deck com piscina. Fazia calor na noite em que a reportagem esteve no local, mas os casais preferiram sair de lá com a roupa seca. Elaine, 25, ameaçou pular algumas vezes na água. Parecia a mais empolgada da noite.
"Gosto de ir à piscina quando a noite está quente. Conforme as pessoas vão entrando nela, vira uma putaria só."
"Se acha que swing vai salvar o casamento, vai foder de vez"
Elaine e o namorado, Erick, 35, frequentam o swing há cinco anos, após ela manifestar o fetiche de ver o companheiro transando com outra pessoa. Desde então, dizem, toda semana escolhem um local diferente para satisfazer seus desejos. Na Paris, preferem a festa dos iniciantes. "Gostamos da individualidade dos casais", ela descreve.
Naquela noite, Elaine beijou duas amigas que estavam na casa pela primeira vez, enquanto o companheiro apenas assistia de longe toda a pegação. Ela prefere interagir com mulheres iniciantes: "É mais fácil do que homem, porque eles são muito afoitos, já elas conversam mais. Algumas falam que não ficam com mulher, mas aí você elogia e o resto é maravilhoso."
O público é bem variado, entre os 18 e 70 anos. Como tem muito casal iniciando no meio, Elias explica uma a uma as regras da casa, que são basicamente respeitar a vontade alheia e não sair pegando em ninguém sem permissão. E combinar antes o que vai querer.
"Não podem esquecer que amanhã vocês ainda são um casal. Se acha que swing vai salvar o seu casamento, vai acabar de foder de vez. Agora, se é questão realmente de apimentar, beleza", avisa ele.
Cunha e Micheliny traçaram bem o que queriam antes de sair de casa. Ela conta que tinha preconceito contra o meio —enquanto o marido sempre manteve a mente aberta—, mas saiu gostando mais que o companheiro. "Resolvemos sair um pouco da rotina, cientes de que não precisamos fazer nada. E voltamos mais unidos. A libido aumentou mais ainda e queremos voltar", ela conta.
Frequentador do swing há oito anos, onde se conheceu, o casal M&G, de 39 e 35 anos, decreta: se um só vai pela vontade do outro, ninguém vai sair satisfeito.
"O diálogo na hora do íntimo torna tudo muito fácil. Depois, é chegar no lugar, observar o que está acontecendo ao seu redor e interagir", a mulher ensina.
Na segunda visita à Paris Café, a dupla ficou até pelo menos as 2h apenas conversando e observando a movimentação. Quando um casal começou a transar no meio da boate, a dupla encontrou uma novata na companhia de amigos. Já eram quase 4h quando os cinco começaram a transar.
"Gozamos bastante e ainda trocamos contato. No swing de verdade é assim: você conhece gente diferente, se diverte, transa gostoso e no final ainda rola aquela amizade bacana que pode levar pra vida."

Article: O Rock in Rio anunciou, durante evento na segunda-feira, 29, duas ações sociais: um projeto de auxílio a favelas que será desenvolvido pela ONG Gerando Falcões, com o apoio da Gerdau e da Fundação Grupo Volkswagen, e um projeto de combate à fome liderado pela ONG Ação da Cidadania.
O projeto de auxílio a favelas é o mesmo que o The Town, festival organizado em São Paulo pela mesma empresa que produz o Rock in Rio, adotou em 2023, quando passou a atender 290 famílias da favela do Haiti, em São Paulo, na Vila Prudente (zona leste de SP), por meio do projeto Favela 3D (Digital, Digna e Desenvolvida), criado pela Gerando Falcões.
Na versão carioca do projeto, serão atendidas inicialmente 250 famílias (cerca de 1.200 pessoas) do Buraco e Sessenta, regiões da favela do morro da Providência, no centro da capital fluminense. O objetivo é oferecer qualificação profissional a 150 famílias e proporcionar dignidade a outras 125, empregando 95% das pessoas atendidas.
"Além disso, também queremos formar 20 jovens e lideranças comunitárias para seguir com o trabalho, mesmo após o fim do projeto. Teremos ainda uma intervenção física, a partir do urbanismo social, em um espaço coletivo", afirma Edu Lyra, fundador e presidente da ONG Gerando Falcões e criador do projeto Favela 3D.
No Rio, o projeto terá duração de dois anos e será realizado pela ONG Entre o Céu e a Favela, que integra a rede Gerando Falcões. Já a Ação da Cidadania, parceira antiga do Rock in Rio, vai atuar no combate à fome. Segundo a ONG, 64 milhões de brasileiros têm algum grau de insegurança alimentar e, dentre essas, 8,1 milhões realmente não têm comida.
Para dar início e estimular o movimento, o Rock in Rio se comprometeu a doar 1,5 milhão de refeições, e a meta é ampliar esse número por meio de doações.
Deixa o Coração Falar
O Rock in Rio lançou uma música para marcar a edição deste ano, quando serão comemorados os 40 anos do primeiro festival. Deixa o Coração Falar foi composta por Zé Ricardo, curador do festival, e mais de 60 artistas brasileiros foram reunidos para a gravação do clipe da canção.
Os direitos dos artistas participantes serão destinados às duas ONGs parceiras do festival - Gerando Falcões e Ação da Cidadania. O Rock in Rio também vai criar produtos licenciados que terão seus lucros revertidos em doações, além de promover leilões de instrumentos musicais autografados. O público poderá fazer doações pelo site oficial do Rock in Rio e durante a compra de ingressos.
"Nesses mais de 30 anos de Ação da Cidadania, o Roberto Medina (criador do Rock in Rio) e sua família sempre foram grandes parceiros nas campanhas contra à fome e às desigualdades sociais. O Rock in Rio, mais uma vez, vai mobilizar o público e toda a sociedade civil para tirar o Brasil do mapa da fome. E contar com tantos artistas incríveis tornará esse movimento ainda maior", comemorou Daniel Souza, presidente do Conselho da Ação da Cidadania.
"Está na hora da gente mobilizar mais uma vez as pessoas, assim como fizemos em 1985, pós-ditadura, e em 2001, quando paralisamos todas as emissoras de rádio e TV por três minutos para provocar as pessoas a refletirem sobre o papel de cada um de nós na construção de um mundo melhor.
O Rock in Rio sempre foi disruptivo ao unir na Cidade do Rock as mais diferentes tribos. Para esta edição, em que celebramos os nossos 40 anos de história, este movimento será ainda maior e mais potente. Não é sobre música, mas sobre pessoas. Vamos nos abraçar e cantar, pela união, pela paz, pelo combate à fome e no combate à pobreza", afirmou Roberto Medina, presidente da Rock World, empresa que criou, organiza e produz o Rock in Rio e o The Town.

Article: Mais uma ação preventiva voltada para a segurança do paciente foi realizada, nesta terça-feira (30), no Hospital Municipal Santa Isabel (HMSI), maior equipamento hospitalar do município administrado pela Prefeitura de João Pessoa. A ação foi organizada pelo Núcleo de Segurança do Paciente (NSP) e teve como objetivo melhorar a eficácia da comunicação e o trabalho em equipe.
A diretora-geral do HMSI, a médica Adriana Lobão, ressaltou a importância da comunicação e do trabalho em equipe, que garantem menos erro e mais segurança aos pacientes. “Nós valorizamos a comunicação e o trabalho em equipe como forma de aumentar a segurança nos processos de trabalho. Uma comunicação efetiva diminui a possibilidade de erros e ela é feita no Hospital Santa Isabel diariamente, de forma verbal, escrita ou eletrônica, através de rounds, visitas multidisciplinares e da vivência”, destacou.
Durante o evento, que contou com palestra de Maja Lima, profissional que capacita equipes há 13 anos, foi realizada uma dinâmica interativa entre os participantes. “A palestrante despertou em nossa equipe o interesse no autoconhecimento e no poder coletivo. Nesta interação foram compartilhadas estratégias para a melhoria do trabalho em equipe e o investimento de tempo e energia de todos os coordenadores em potencializar a comunicação efetiva em todos os níveis dos processos de trabalho”, explicou a nutricionista Danielly Chiappetta, que coordena o Núcleo de Segurança do Paciente do hospital.
Também foi debatida a importância das ações do mês de abril, onde normalmente são ampliadas as discussões sobre o trabalho para melhoria da segurança do paciente. Os debates também envolveram moldes adequados da notificação e desenvolvimento pessoal coletivo.
Na ação, realizada no Centro de Estudos (Ceapes), foi divulgado pela primeira vez vídeo interativo sobre os procedimentos internos, visando a melhor absorção dos protocolos por todos os colaborares.
A comunicação efetiva é uma das seis metas internacionais de segurança do paciente. No caso, a meta 2. “É quando a mensagem que a gente quer passar é feita de forma clara e compreendida de forma clara pelo receptor”, afirma Danielly Chiappetta.
A ação teve como público-alvo coordenadores dos diversos setores e serviços do HMSI e a equipe assistencial.

Article: A FAB (Força Aérea Brasileira) disponibilizou nesta terça-feira (30) dois helicópteros modelo H-60 Black Hawk para ajudar no resgate dos atingidos pela enchente na região de Santa Maria (RS), a cerca de 350km de Porto Alegre. Os temporais que castigam o Rio Grande do Sul desde essa segunda (29) causaram estragos em mais de 70 municípios. Cinco pessoas morreram e dezenas estão feridas ou desaparecidas, segundo autoridades.
“Em uma das ações de apoio, a FAB resgatou uma família que estava ilhada em uma casa com risco de desabamento (água entrando na casa), a qual foi içada e transportada da região de Candelária até Santa Cruz”, informou, acrescentando que “devido ao horário e às condições meteorológicas, a operação é auxiliada com a utilização de óculos de visão noturna”.
Mais cedo, o presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva prometeu enviar ajuda do governo federal para o estado, que vive uma nova onda de chuvas e ocorrência de enchentes.
“Em postagem nas redes sociais, Lula disse que falou com o governador [Eduardo Leite (PSDB)] por telefone e determinou aos ministérios da Integração e Desenvolvimento Regional, da Defesa e da Comunicação Social que atuem no estado”, informou o governo.
Governador pediu apoio aéreo
Em uma série de postagens nas redes sociais, Leite fez um apelo pelo envio de ajuda, principalmente, apoio aéreo.
“Precisamos resgatar já centenas de pessoas em dezenas de municípios que estão em situação de emergência pelas chuvas intensas já ocorridas e que vão continuar nos próximos dias”, escreveu Leite.
Cerca de 50 mortos
O estado vem sofrendo com ciclos cada vez mais recorrentes de intempéries climáticas. No segundo semestre do ano passado, enchentes provocadas por fortes chuvas fizeram transbordar o Rio Taquari, em uma das piores cheias em décadas e deixaram um rastro de destruição, perdas materiais e cerca de 50 mortes.

Article: NYT: Запад опоздал с поддержкой ВСУ в Артёмовске
Вашингтон, 15 февраля, 2023, 12:01 — ИА Регнум. Западные страны опоздали с оказанием помощи ВСУ в Артёмовске. Об этом пишет газета New York Times.
14 февраля в штаб-квартире НАТО в Брюсселе прошли заседания глав минобороны стран — членов этого альянса и контактной группы по Украине. Отмечается, что данные встречи завершатся 15 февраля.
Издание пишет, что какие бы решения на этих заседаниях не принимались союзниками Киева, уже очевидно, что для помощи ВСУ в Артёмовске они будут слишком запоздалыми.
Как передавало ИА REGNUM, после того как Киев лишится контроля над Артёмовском, Владимир Зеленский будет свергнут, с таким предположением выступил 14 февраля бывший советник экс-президента Украины Леонида Кучмы Олег Соскин.

Путин призвал МЧС постоянно следить, чтобы требования пожарной безопасности не нарушались
Москва, 15 февраля, 2023, 11:48 — ИА Регнум. Сотрудники МЧС должны постоянно следить, чтобы не нарушались требования пожарной безопасности. Об этом 15 февраля заявил президент России Владимир Путин в приветственном слове на расширенной коллегии ведомства.
«Реализуя принцип рискориентированного подхода к проверкам организаций, вы должны постоянно следить, чтобы не нарушались требования пожарной безопасности», — сказал Путин.
Он добавил, что всегда необходимо помнить, что любая недоработка может привести к беде.
По словам главы государства, по-прежнему актуальной является задача предупреждения техногенных пожаров.
Президент выразил уверенность, что спасатели будут и далее действовать оперативно, с высокой отдачей и достойно выполнять свой долг.

Эксперт ВОЗ: организация приостановила дальнейшее расследование происхождения COVID-19
Лондон, 15 февраля, 2023, 11:57 — ИА Регнум. Всемирная организация здравоохранения (ВОЗ) приняла решение о приостановке дальнейшего расследования происхождения коронавируса. Об этом, как передает британская газета The Daily Telegraph, заявила эксперт организации Мария ван Керкхове.
По её словам, соответствующее решение принято в связи с проблемами со сбором данных.
«Политические события во всем мире действительно воспрепятствовали прогрессу в понимании происхождения COVID-19», — сказала она, добавив, что вторая фаза поэтапного плана проводиться не будет.
Как сообщало ИА REGNUM, американские конгрессмены приступили к расследованию генезиса COVID-19. Они изучают полученную информацию из администрации США и экс главного эпидемиолога Энтони Фаучи.

В Госдуме хотят пересмотреть постановление Съезда депутатов СССР по Афганистану
Москва, 15 февраля, 2023, 11:56 — ИА Регнум. Фракция СРЗП в Госдуме предложит нижней палате парламента признать не соответствующим исторической правде пункт постановления Съезда народных депутатов СССР, в котором осуждался ввод войск в Афганистан. Как передает корреспондент ИА REGNUM 15 февраля, об этом заявил руководитель фракции Сергей Миронов.
«Наша фракция подготовила проект заявления Государственной думы, который касается вопроса о принятом решении Съездом народных депутатов 24 декабря 1989 года, в котором, к сожалению, признается, что ввод советских войск требует политического и государственного осуждения. Мы считаем, что это плевок в адрес наших интернационалистов, в адрес огромного количества штатских, которые помогали, строили в Афганистане различные гражданские объекты, и мы считаем, что в интересах исторической правды Государственная дума должна признать не соответствующим исторической правде этот пункт постановления Съезда народных депутатов», — сказал парламентарий.
Миронов пояснил, что это предложение фракция предложит обсудить на сегодняшнем заседании.

The Sun: полет Ту-95МС над Беринговым морем стал грозным посланием России Западу
Лондон, 15 февраля, 2023, 11:59 — ИА Регнум. Полет двух российских стратегических ракетоносцев Ту-95МС над нейтральными водами Берингова моря стал грозным сигналом Западу из-за отправки оружия Киеву, пишет The Sun.
Отмечается, что Москва еще до начала конфликта на Украине усилила патрулирование воздушного пространства у границ Соединенных Штатов.
Так, пишет автор статьи, количество вылетов за последние годы увеличилось в шесть раз.
Как сообщало ИА REGNUM, ранее два российских стратегических ракетоносца Ту-95МС выполнили плановый семичасовой полет над нейтральными водами Берингова моря. Общая продолжительность полета составила более семи часов.
Российские ракетоносцы летели в сопровождении истребителей Су-30 объединения ВВС и ПВО Восточного военного округа.

Article: Рецепт палочка-выручалочка для приготовление паски без дрожжей, он выручит всегда, когда нет времени готовить дрожжевое тесто.
Рецепт бездрожжевой паски: Мука - 440 гр. Молоко - 180 мл. Сахар - 200 гр. Яйца - 5 шт. Сливочное масло - 230 гр. Разрыхлитель теста - 12 гр. Цедра 1 лимона Изюм - 60 гр. Цукаты - 60 гр.
Итак, в глубокую емкость отправляем 5 яиц, сахар и хорошо взбиваем миксером на максимальной скорости, 3-4 минуты.
Получается пышная масса, затем добавляем молоко комнатной температуры, размягченное сливочное масло и перемешиваем на низких оборотах. Муку смешиваем с разрыхлителем и небольшими порциями в яичную массу замешиваем тесто.
Далее в тесто натираем цедру одного лимона, добавим цукаты изюм и все
перемешиваем.
Выпекать паски без дрожжей нужно в бумажных формах, смазывать их не нужно, если вы будете выпекать в металлической форме, то смажьте растительным маслом и присыпьте немного мукой.
Заполняем тестом формы чуть больше половины, из данного количества ингредиента выходит две паски диаметром 12 сантиметров и одна паска диаметром 9 сантиметров.
Все отправляем в разогретую до 180 градусов духовку на 35-40 минут. Паски готовы, дайте им полностью остыть и теперь снимаем формы.
Не пугайтесь, что паски по этому рецепту сверху потрескались, верхушки нужно закрыть глазурью, например, на желатине.
