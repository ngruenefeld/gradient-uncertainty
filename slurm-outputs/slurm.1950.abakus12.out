Article: Jessica Simpson dazzled in a new image shared on Instagram this week, where she was seen promoting her new collaboration with Walmart.
The fashion-forward entrepreneur and singer, known for her Jessica Simpson Collection, looked stunning in a bright green bikini.
The ensemble showcased Jessica's incredible figure following her notable 100-pound weight loss after the birth of her third child with husband Eric Johnson.
The 43-year-old mother of three styled her hair down, adding a touch of glam with a straw hat and jewelled belt and skirt.
She posed gracefully by the shore, embodying the vibrant spirit of her new collection. "We’re so excited to share our collaboration with @walmart!" Jessica shared in her caption.
"An all-new collection of over 100 pieces across apparel and swimwear (styles you won’t find anywhere else!) and jewelry to help you style a versatile, affordable, easy-to-wear summer wardrobe! Available in sizes XS-4X (apparel) and XXL (swim) at select @walmart stores and online! #WalmartFashion," she enthused about the partnership.
In another heartfelt caption, Jessica described her style for the day as 'Cali boho meets Texas charm.'
The A Public Affair singer's venture with Walmart features an exclusive collection that includes everything from swimwear to everyday apparel, all infused with her signature style.
The promotional video for the collaboration highlights several photoshoots, showcasing the breadth and appeal of the new collection.
Jessica also took a moment to reflect on the mission of her brand, stating, "We can't wait to help even more women feel their absolute best and most confident in what they wear."
Her brand, which launched in 2005 initially focusing on footwear, has since expanded into a full-fledged lifestyle brand embracing clothing and home goods. The transition reflects Jessica's evolving personal style and her deep commitment to accessible fashion.
The entrepreneur, alongside her mother Tina, regained control of the brand in 2021 after its parent company faced financial difficulties.
This move underscored her dedication to her business and her desire to keep her brand closely aligned with her vision and values. Jessica shared with People magazine how she draws design inspiration from various sources, including music, art, and her children. "I get my design inspiration from everywhere, like a song I love or a piece of art. I love vintage fashion, so I am always looking through archival prints and cuts," she explained.
Particularly inspired by her eldest daughter, Maxwell, Jessica admires her unique fashion sense and infectious confidence. "I am very inspired by my daughter Maxwell. Her pulse on fashion is so unique. She is an infectious trendsetter and always effortlessly confident," she proudly stated.
Jessica, who also embraces her role as a mother with fervor, recently spoke about her increased confidence since becoming a parent.
She expressed a newfound appreciation for her body's capabilities, saying, "It wasn't until I became a mother that I learned to celebrate what a woman's body can do. I am more confident now after three kids than I was at 25!"
With her family, including her supportive husband Eric and their three children, Jessica continues to balance her busy life with flair. The couple, who married in 2014, share daughters Maxwell Drew and Birdie Mae, as well as son Ace Knute.
Jessica’s diet secrets
Jessica is believed to have lost around 100lbs. This impressive transformation followed the birth of her third child, Birdie, in 2019. Opening up about her journey, Jessica shared with E! News, “I went to a nutritionist, and I needed to get my eating habits right.”
Earlier this year, she humorously dismissed rumors of using the weight-loss drug Ozempic, reflecting on her body's evolution over the years with Bustle, “I am fortunate to have been every size... For [my] brand, understanding the women [who buy our products] and for my psyche.”

Article: Police surround Columbia University as antiwar protests grow at U.S. campuses
Updated April 30, 2024 at 21:15 PM ET
New York police surrounded Columbia University and activists put out calls for more protestors on social media as the chaotic pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus appeared to reach a turning point late Tuesday.
Protesters have occupied the central campus building of Hamilton Hall for most of Tuesday, after the school asked them to voluntarily disperse from an encampment.
The NYPD, with some officers seen in riot gear and carrying zip tie handcuffs, blocked off sections of Broadway near the Columbia Morningside campus late Tuesday.
Activists asked supporters on social media to "mobilize." And people have shown up. A large crowd of protesters gathered outside of the gates of the campus Tuesday evening.
The tensions are one snapshot of protests erupting at college campuses across the U.S. The students are calling for universities to sell off their investments in companies that have businesses or investments in Israel because of the country's invasion of Gaza.
The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, while Israel says some 1,200 Israelis were killed by Hamas in an assault last October. Israel says Hamas is still holding 133 hostages.
Columbia has started suspending the students who have refused to leave and they now face expulsion.
In announcing the disciplinary actions, the school saidon Tuesday that the protesters "have chosen to escalate to an untenable situation."
Two prominent New York Democrats, U.S. Reps. Jerry Nadler and Adriano Espailla, called on the school to "move quickly and swiftly to remove the students who have engaged in unlawful activity."
They wrote in a shared statement that the students are entitled to free speech, but criticized recent actions of the demonstrations at Columbia.
On the other side of the U.S., students broke into the library at Portland State University in Oregon, triggering a campus-wide shutdown.
Many such demonstrations continue with no end in sight, but administrations at Northwestern University and Brown University managed to strike deals with protesters that included agreements to examine the schools' investments.
Campuses see big protests across the U.S.
In Oregon, Portland State University closed its campus on Tuesday, after demonstrators took over the school's library. The protesters broke into the Branford Price Millar Library during the night, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports.
Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt's office said his position is that "the actions taking place have crossed into criminal behavior, and we will prosecute."
Earlier on Tuesday at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, police arrested demonstrators who refused to shut down a "Gaza Solidarity Encampment" protest that began at the Polk Place quad on campus Friday.
Police detained some 30 protesters and moved them elsewhere on campus, according to student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel, which says six people in the group were arrested. Video posted on Instagram by the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine showed UNC police chief Brian James informing protesters that they were trespassing, as they chanted, "We will not stop, we will not rest."
UNC interim Chancellor Lee Roberts and Provost Christopher Clemens sent a letter early Tuesday ordering protesters to dismantle the camp and leave, threatening arrests and potential expulsion.
On Monday, police arrested nearly 80 people protesting in support of Palestinians at the University of Texas at Austin after demonstrators set up an encampment on the south lawn, according to member station KUT.
"Police and troopers in riot gear surrounded the protesters and made arrests," KUT reports.
UT Austin says that protesters "escalated by becoming physically and verbally combative" when approached, adding that it moved against the encampment because demonstrators' tents violated school rules. The arrests were for trespassing or disorderly conduct, it said.
The Palestine Solidarity Committee in Austin, a group organizing protests, condemned school president Jay Hartzell's administration for "yet again calling police to violently suppress students" — a reference to dozens of arrests made last Wednesday.
Along with its demands related to Israel and the Palestinians, the group says Hartzell — who has Gov. Greg Abbott's support — must resign. The group says it plans to hold another demonstration on Wednesday at noon, local time.
Northwestern and Brown reach agreements with protestors
This week Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and, as of Tuesday, Brown University in Rhode Island reached deals with student protesters to deescalate the demonstrations.
Brown President Christina Paxson shared details on the agreement in a campus-wide message on Tuesday.
"The devastation and loss of life in the Middle East has prompted many to call for meaningful change, while also raising real issues about how best to accomplish this," Paxson wrote. "Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog, debate and listening to each other."
Students of the Brown Divest Coalition set up an unauthorized encampment on the school's College Green on April 24, according to the university. With this new deal to deescalate protests, the students have agreed to end the encampment by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Additionally, they will refrain from any further actions "that would violate Brown's conduct code" through the end of the school year, including Commencement and Reunion Weekend.
In return, the school said it would invite five students to meet with five members of the Corporation of Brown University, the University's governing body that includes a Board of Trustees and a Board of Fellows, in May. The students will be allowed to hold a presentation on why Brown's endowment should divest from "companies enabling and profiting from the genocide in Gaza," the agreement stated.
Paxson said she will also ask the Advisory Committee on University Resources Management, the panel responsible for reviewing whether Brown's business and investment practices follow ethical and moral standards consistent with the school's goals and values, to provide a recommendation on divestment by Sept. 30, which will then be brought to the Corporation for a vote at its October meeting.
Dozens of tents set up by protesters at Northwestern in Evanston have been removed from the school's Deering Meadow, after a pro-Palestinian coalition agreed to a deal with school leaders on Monday.
Under the agreement, the Northwestern Divestment Coalition can continue to organize limited protests through at least June 1. Protesters who aren't affiliated with the school are also barred from participating.
In return, the school agreed to transparency measures around its investments, to give support to Middle Eastern and Muslim students, and to fund the "full cost of attendance for five Palestinian undergraduates" to attend the school for four years, along with two visiting Palestinian faculty for two years.
The university also said it will look to add more support for Jewish students. It called recent reports of antisemitic and anti-Muslim/Palestinian incidents "unacceptable."
The school said its goal was to "ensure that the violence and escalation we have seen elsewhere does not happen here at Northwestern."
Columbia and protesters hit a new impasse on Monday
While demonstrators elsewhere have reached deals with their schools' administrations, campus officials at Columbia have rejected student demands to divest from companies operating in Israel.
So, students entered Hamilton Hall early Tuesday morning, chained and barricaded its doors and have been using a rope system to get supplies from supporters, reported WKCR, the university radio station.
Outside, a crowd cheered as the facade was draped with signs reading "Intifada" and "Hind's Hall" — the latter a reference to Hind Rajab, a young Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza in January.
The university is now under what amounts to a lockdown of the campus in Manhattan's Morningside Heights, with access restricted to essential-service employees and students who live in residential halls on the campus.
"This building has now been liberated," an Instagram account affiliated with the student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest announced as it posted an image of Hamilton Hall, echoing language used during a 1968 protest.
Columbia students protesting racism against Black people and the Vietnam War were occupying Hamilton Hall and other buildings exactly 56 years ago — on April 30, 1968 — when police violently cleared the campus. More than 700 people were arrested and almost 150 people were injured.
The New York Police Department says it has officers stationed outside the university, but not on school grounds.
Tuesday's campus shutdown was mirrored by one at Barnard College, which is closely affiliated with Columbia.
Columbia's leadership has set several deadlines as it seeks to reach an agreement with demonstrators to end the encampment, as the school said it violates school policies and is a threat to campus safety, a disturbance to Jewish students and students trying to study and sleep.
Columbia seeks ways to hold graduation ceremony
Columbia's last day of classes for the spring semester was Monday, marking the start of "reading week," in which students traditionally prepare for looming final exams. Those exams are currently set to begin on Friday, with commencement planned for May 15.
Columbia President Minouche Shafik said on Monday that she wanted the protesters to "disperse voluntarily," urging them to consider that the graduating class of 2024 did not get to have their high school commencement ceremonies in person due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The president also said the school was prepared to allow demonstrations to resume after exams and commencement. But, Shafik added, protesters would need to submit an application at least two days in advance, and protests would be allowed only in designated areas.
Shafik said Columbia has supported protests and vigils that happened earlier in the year, as they were peaceful and didn't disturb campus operations.
But she added the encampment has caused an "unwelcoming environment" and "hostile environment" for Jewish students, and violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws discrimination at schools that receive federal funding.

Article: NEW YORK — (AP) — Large numbers of New York City police officers began entering the Columbia University late Tuesday as dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters remained on the campus.
Shortly before officers entered the campus, the New York Police Department received a notice from Columbia authorizing officers to take action, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to discuss details of the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
After entering the campus, a contingent of police officers approached Hamilton Hall, the administration building that students began occupying in the morning.
Students had defiantly set up tents again after police cleared an encampment at the university on April 18 and arrested more than 100 people. The students had been protesting on the Manhattan campus since the previous day, opposing Israeli military action in Gaza and demanding the school divest from companies they claim are profiting from the conflict.
Protests have spread to campuses from California to Massachusetts as May commencement ceremonies near, putting added pressure on schools to clear protesters.
More than 1,000 protesters have been arrested over the last two weeks on campuses in states including Texas, Utah, Virginia, North Carolina, New Mexico, Connecticut, Louisiana, California and New Jersey, some after violent clashes with police in riot gear.
“Walk away from this situation now and continue your advocacy through other means,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams advised the Columbia protesters on Tuesday afternoon. “This must end now.”
The White House condemned the standoffs at Columbia and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where protesters had occupied two buildings until officers with batons intervened overnight and arrested 25 people. Officials estimated the northern California campus' total damage to be upwards of $1 million.
President Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is “absolutely the wrong approach,” and “not an example of peaceful protest,” said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.
Other colleges have sought to negotiate agreements with the demonstrators in the hopes of having peaceful commencement ceremonies. As cease-fire negotiations appeared to gain steam, it wasn't clear whether those talks would inspire an easing of protests.
Northwestern University notched a rare win when officials said they reached a compromise with students and faculty who represent the majority of protesters on its campus near Chicago to allow peaceful demonstrations through the end of spring classes.
The nationwide campus protests began at Columbia in response to Israel’s offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.
Israel and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.
On Columbia's campus, protesters locked arms early Tuesday and carried furniture and metal barricades to Hamilton Hall, among several buildings that were occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest. Demonstrators called the building Hind's Hall, honoring a young girl who was killed in Gaza under Israeli fire.
The takeover came hours after protesters had shrugged off an earlier ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended — restricted from all academic and recreational spaces, allowed only to enter their residences, and, for seniors, ineligible to graduate.
Mahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator before talks with the administration broke down over the weekend, was among the suspended students. His suspension letter — which he shared with The Associated Press — said he had refused to leave the encampment after prior warnings, but Khalil said he had abided by the university’s demand to vacate the encampment on the campus lawn by the Monday afternoon deadline.
Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement that anyone occupying Hamilton Hall risked being expelled from the university for escalating the protest “to an untenable situation — vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows, and blockading entrances.”
Occupying protesters have insisted they will remain in Hamilton Hall until the university agrees to three demands — divestment, financial transparency and amnesty.
The Columbia University Chapter of the American Association of University Professors said faculty’s efforts to help defuse the situation have been repeatedly ignored by the university’s administration despite school statutes that require consultation. The group warned of potential conflict between police officers nearby and protesters on campus.
“We hold University leadership responsible for the disastrous lapses of judgment that have gotten us to this point,” the chapter said in a statement late Tuesday. “The University President, her senior staff, and the Board of Trustees will bear responsibility for any injuries that may occur during any police action on our campus.”
Ilana Lewkovitch, a self-described “leftist Zionist” student at Columbia, said it’s been hard to concentrate on school for weeks, amid calls for Zionists to die or leave campus. Her exams have been punctuated with chants of “say it loud, say it clear, we want Zionists out of here” in the background, she said.
Lewkovitch, who identifies as Jewish and studied at Columbia’s Tel Aviv campus, said she wished the current pro-Palestinian protests were more open to people like her who criticize Israel’s war policies but believe there should be an Israeli state.
Adams claimed Tuesday that the Columbia protests have been “co-opted by professional outside agitators.” The mayor didn’t provide specific evidence to back up that contention, which was disputed by protest organizers and participants.
NYPD officials made similar claims about “outside agitators” during the huge, grassroots demonstrations against racial injustice that erupted across the city after the death of George Floyd in 2020. In some instances, top police officials falsely labeled peaceful marches organized by well-known neighborhood activists as the work of violent extremists.

Article: Newswise — A new study has found that pancreatic cancer cells are different based on their location in the pancreas, providing new information about tumors that could lead to better targeted treatments.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer, and the diagnosis has dramatically increased over the last decade. It is currently the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women globally and projected to be the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths world-wide by 2030. This increase is due to several factors such as an increase in obesity and diabetes.
Houston Methodist’s section chief of gastrointestinal medical oncology, Dr. Maen Abdelrahim, served as first and concept generating author for the article titled, “Comparative molecular profiling of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the head versus body and tail,” published in NPJ Precision Oncology, an online journal in the Nature family of publications. The research team discovered that the anatomical location of the pancreatic tumor is a contributing factor for the outcomes of systematic therapy interventions.
Abdelrahim and his collaborators established a hypothesis that there is a difference in microenvironments of tumors in the pancreatic head versus the body and tail, particularly the immunotherapy receptors found on each section of the pancreas.
“By focusing on biology around the tumor and taking its location on the pancreas into account we can better evaluate our treatment options,” said Abdelrahim. “Rather than treating patients under the umbrella of pancreatic malignancy, a shift to a tumor location-based model can seriously alter how clinicians set up preliminary treatment plans.”
The team hopes this finding will help clinicians develop a more specific treatment plan and improve patient outcomes.
Abdelrahim’s collaborators on this study were Benjamine A. Weinberg, Adbullah Esmail, Anup Kasi, Nestor F. Esnaola, Joanne Xiu, and Yasmine Baca.

Article: LOS ANGELES — (AP) — At least 55 people were hurt, two seriously, when a Metro light rail train and a University of Southern California shuttle bus collided Tuesday along a busy thoroughfare in downtown Los Angeles, officials said.
The crash happened shortly before noon along Exposition Boulevard, near the USC campus and Natural History Museum, according to the LA Fire Department.
Two victims were hospitalized with serious injuries and 16 others were transported in fair condition, the department said. Another 37 people were treated at the scene.
Dave Sotero, a spokesperson for LA Metro, said the bus crossed into the path of an E Line train. The light rail line runs from East Los Angeles to downtown Santa Monica mostly along streets, and not all of the crossings have gates.
Genesis Hernandez was transferring from a Metro bus to catch the E Line to Santa Monica, where she attends college when “all of a sudden I just saw a bunch of ambulances going by,” she recalled.
The 19-year-old was able to view the crash scene from a platform at the Expo/Vermont Metro station. “The bus definitely got crunched on its front end,” she said. “The train didn't look too damaged.”
Television news footage showed the left side of the red and white bus smashed against the first car of the train. The front section of the bus had significant damage.
The Starcraft 40-passenger bus was traveling westbound on Exposition Boulevard with only the driver and one passenger aboard when the collision occurred, according to a statement from USC Transportation. The bus driver and passenger were the two most severely injured, according to fire department officials.
There were more than 150 passengers on the Santa Monica-bound Metro train, officials said.
Sotero said the Los Angeles Police Department would be in charge of the investigation.
“Metro offers its sympathy to those injured in the accident,” Sotero said in an email.
Exposition Boulevard was closed in both directions during the initial investigation. Metro said its train service would be limited and buses would be used to get passengers through the crash area.

Gov. Jim Pillen announces Brig. Gen. Craig Strong as his pick for adjutant general of the Nebraska National Guard on Friday, May 26, 2023, in Lincoln. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
LINCOLN — Approximately two dozen Nebraska National Guard members will be deployed to Elkhorn to assist with security as early as Wednesday, in the wake of last week’s tornado outbreak.
Gov. Jim Pillen on Tuesday announced that the Guard will assist with neighborhood security after a string of tornadoes ripped through Lancaster, Douglas and Washington Counties, particularly the communities of Waverly, Elkhorn and Bennington. Soldiers will assist with deterring looting and managing heavy vehicle traffic.

At this time, Douglas County officials have requested National Guard personnel only for Elkhorn, though additional requests could be made in the future.
Pillen signed an emergency proclamation Sunday allowing access to the Governor’s Emergency Fund to help communities in the three counties recover from storm damage.
Over the weekend the governor and Adj. Gen. Craig Strong, who oversees the Nebraska National Guard, toured parts of the storm path and witnessed the damage firsthand. At a Monday news conference, Pillen said he and Strong were assessing damages and had not reached a decision on Guard deployment.
“I don’t know that anybody can find the right words to use it, but it’s a war zone,” Pillen said. “The longer it (the tornado) went, the bigger it got and the wider it was.”
The National Weather Service estimated the tornado that hit Elkhorn in western Douglas County, before moving into Washington County, was an EF-3 tornado, with 165 mph peak wind, the highest wind in the EF-3 rating before being classified an EF-4.
The tornado was on the ground for nearly one hour and traveled 31.16 miles, crossing the Missouri River into Harrison County, Iowa. It had a maximum width of 1,600 yards, or 0.9 miles.
Pillen has said the Arbor Day storms destroyed about 450 Nebraska homes and that Nebraska remains in contact with federal partners, including FEMA, for additional assistance.

Article: Newswise — Interdisciplinary researchers in Illinois, the U.S. and around the world can advance their projects with the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology's new Zeiss Xradia 630 Versa micro-CT scanner, the first of its kind with life science applications in the U.S.
Computed tomography, or CT, is an imaging technique that involves capturing a series of cross-sectional X-ray scans of an object or sample — be it a material like concrete or a biological sample like an insect or human body. Stacked on top of one another, the images non-invasively reconstruct the subject in 3D from the inside out. Microscopic computed tomography, or micro-CT, helps researchers reconstruct subjects as tiny and delicate as collagen or insect antennae.
Most micro-CT scanners use only X-rays, which are invisible to the human eye, but Beckman’s new model also incorporates visible through a process called scintillation. The 630 Versa can also scan small subsections of large materials while maintaining a maximum imaging resolution of 40 nanometers, 2,500 times narrower than the width of a human hair.
“With building materials, hairline cracks are the start of where things go catastrophically wrong, and the micro-CT scanner at the Beckman Institute can see those cracks,” said Beckman microscopist T. Josek. “We’re providing the opportunity for researchers at the University of Illinois and beyond to start here and start small — see how a material behaves and what it looks like, and then scale up.”
Researchers can use the compression/tensile stage to stretch, bend and compress their samples while scrutinizing them up close — a technique called in situ mechanical testing. The Versa 630 can also do diffraction contrast tomography, a technique wherein researchers can determine a material’s grain orientation by tracking how X-rays bend as they pass through it.
The scanner was installed in January 2024 and is the first 630 model for life science applications in the U.S. In addition to the Beckman Institute, the Illinois Materials Research Laboratory, The Grainger College of Engineering and the Office for the Vice Chancellor of Research and Innovation committed funds to support its purchase.
The Beckman Microscopy Suite team is focused on finding projects on campus and beyond that might benefit from the Versa 630 and are providing comprehensive trainings for those new to the technology. Carl Zeiss Microscopy, the scanner’s manufacturer, is integral to these efforts.
"We at ZEISS are thrilled to be partnering with the Beckman Institute Microscopy Suite to deliver this flexible and intuitive system for X-ray microscopy," said Aubrey Funke, Carl Zeiss Microscopy Product Marketing Manager for Life Science EM/XRM. "The ability to image your sample, be it organic or material, becomes a less intimidating process on the ZEISS Xradia Versa 630. With high powered-resolution and expanded ease-of-use for all skill levels, the Versa 630 is ideal for diverse research capabilities across a spectrum of applications, including life science, electronics, materials research, and many more. We look forward to working with the Beckman Institute Microscopy Suite to support many diverse research projects.”
Researchers at the University of Illinois and beyond are encouraged to use the 630 Versa micro-CT scanner. For more information or to use the micro-CT scanner, please visit the Beckman Institute Microscopy Suite website at https://itg.beckman.illinois.edu/microscopy_suite.

Article: The Dallas Cowboys finally got a veteran contract done. Just not any of the ones who are truly pressing.
In the realm of unfinished business for the franchise, that's right about where Monday's one-year deal for running back Ezekiel Elliott registers. It's a blip on the priority scale, adding a modestly reliable deck chair to a ship that has spent the majority of the offseason sinking. And all of this in the backdrop of team owner Jerry Jones' now infamous "all in" proclamation. Precisely how "all in" have the Cowboys been? Well, let's survey.
The head coach, Mike McCarthy, is entering the final year of his contract. It's a season that will feature Jerry's buddy, Bill Belichick, vulturing from the sideline as he looks for a "win now" opportunity in 2025.
The franchise quarterback, Dak Prescott, has no contract extension in sight and is now subject to endless offseason debates about his level of importance to the team.
The top-five wideout, CeeDee Lamb, is seeing a steep price tag become more justifiable by the month, leading to a legitimate question about why the Cowboys didn’t push harder to extend his deal one year ago.
And the best defensive player on the team, Micah Parsons … re-read the above paragraph about Lamb and apply it to next offseason, when we’ll likely be asking why Dallas didn’t get Parsons' deal done one year earlier rather than one year later.
That’s a lot of unfinished business for Dallas, an assembly line of loose ends that easily dwarfs the looming problems of every other team in the NFL. And it’s coming in an offseason when the franchise’s talent has gotten worse.
The offensive line? Younger but not necessarily better.
The running backs? A rotation without a dynamic player.
The wideouts? Less depth.
The defense? Lost the best assistant coach on the staff in coordinator Dan Quinn and watched DeMarcus Lawrence get another year older.
Lest we forget, this all comes amid smaller headlines that should also convey concerns, like the fact that Parsons and Lamb skipped voluntary workouts at the team’s facility this offseason.
Piece it all together and it doesn't necessitate stepping back to understand the larger picture: The Cowboys are at a critical juncture in almost every imaginable way. The franchise could conceivably have a new head coach and new starting quarterback one year from now. Few NFL franchises find themselves in that kind of position and don't slip into some phase of a rebuild.
All of which makes it important that Dallas gets something — anything — of consequence done in the next few months. The top of the list will be Lamb’s extension, which is trending toward making him the highest paid wide receiver in the NFL for at least a short time. Next up will be finding some common ground with Prescott, although as of this week, there was no progress on any new contract with him. But knowing where Prescott stands would go a long way in shaping up a timeframe with Parsons, too. Particularly if Prescott appears destined to test free agency next offseason, which would all but assure he will depart Dallas.
Unquestionably, this is the biggest slate of unfinished business in the league. And the answers promise to shape the Cowboys for at least the next half decade.
As for the rest of the NFL, here are the biggest remaining storylines as we head toward the summer …
Multiple $50 million (plus) per season QB extensions are simmering
Prescott isn’t the only quarterback with an extension that needs to be hammered out. Four other key deals are hanging in the balance, including the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Trevor Lawrence, Detroit Lions’ Jared Goff, Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa, and Green Bay Packers’ Jordan Love. Here’s a snapshot of what is going on with each:
Lawrence's reps and the Jaguars are in talks. He had his fifth-year option picked up this week, officially giving the Jaguars control through the 2025 season, at which point they could begin utilizing franchise tags to keep him in the fold through at least 2027. That's not the plan. Lawrence has been reticent to push it publicly, but he and his representatives would like to get his deal done this offseason — as would the Jaguars. The numbers here will be key. There is no longer a presumption that Lawrence is a lock to sign a deal making him the highest paid player in the NFL, particularly after his injuries and struggles last season. It's worth noting that Lawrence has a league-worst 60 turnovers over the past three seasons. While those aren't all his fault, it's a troubling issue when focused through the context of his rollback in 2023. When you talk to contract evaluators on both the agent and team side, Lawrence appears to slot at the edge of the top five, with his extension somewhere in the neighborhood of the five-year, $255 million pact signed by Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts in 2023. That would put Lawrence's annual average value at $51 million, which is a sweet spot that factors in some projection of a higher ceiling still to come. One thing I want to make clear here: Not all agents are buying this. More than one agent shared the opinion that Lawrence's negotiation should begin with him setting a contract record at quarterback and work from there. That's largely due to his standing as the centerpiece of the franchise and the team's No. 1 overall draft pick in 2021. It's an interesting argument that might foreshadow some sticky negotiations. Whatever the case, if and when the deal gets done, the target is going to be July, prior to training camp.
Goff and the Lions are in talks, but nothing is particularly close at this point. This one is going to be interesting — to the point that it’s possible Goff plays out his deal in 2024 and the Lions apply the franchise tag to him in 2025. That being an option isn’t a signal Detroit is taking a soft approach to commitment. It’s more a matter of the two sides finding the right intersection that recognizes Goff’s success versus where he stacks up with other QBs inside the top 10 contracts at the position. One agent who has done multiple high-end deals, including at quarterback, pointed to the four-year $180 million deal Kirk Cousins signed with Atlanta as a starting point that would need a solid premium added that's reflective of Goff’s hand in last season’s NFC title game run. That premium should put Goff solidly north of Cousins and Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, tipping his average annual salary over the $50 million mark, with two full years of guaranteed money and a partial guarantee into Year 3 of the deal. If it’s less than that, Goff is giving the Lions a hometown discount.
Following the completion of the draft, Tagovailoa’s extension is now at the top of the priority list for the Dolphins. The heavy lifting hasn’t started in talks, but it’s expected to ramp up quickly. Contract evaluators believe the Cousins deal in Atlanta, plus a solid premium due to Tua’s age, provides a set of guardrails in negotiations. The question here will be the number of years and where the guarantees fall — as well as whether those guarantees stretch into a third year. It’s clear Miami is set on getting this one done by training camp. Like Goff, peg Tagovailoa’s deal as being in the neighborhood of $50 million-plus per season, reflecting the salary cap increasing at a higher than anticipated rate.
Due to the CBA’s contract guidelines, Love and the Packers aren’t actually eligible to sign an extension until Friday, due to the deal he signed last offseason not having been on the books for a full year yet and also having a slew of void years attached to it. Now that the draft is in the books and the calendar is turning to May, the two sides can run headlong into hammering an extension out. The floor on this one is going to be significant. With Love’s predecessor Aaron Rodgers departing with a final season salary north of $50 million, that number is expected to be the starting point for Love’s annual average value. You should be noticing a trend here with that $50-million-per-season shelf. If a quarterback is considered to be inside or near the top 10 in the league — or is young with modest success and high remaining upside — agents are aiming for that $50 million mark as a floor. Love will be no different. A franchise tag here isn’t out of the question, given that Love still has a limited track record of success. It should be noted that if a tag is used and Love’s second-half of 2023 materializes as his performance level in 2024, the next round of negotiations after 2024 will be for a deal that makes him the highest paid player in the NFL.
Winds of change in San Francisco
It didn’t happen before or during the NFL Draft, but you can see the setup coming for the 49ers: One of their top two wideouts isn’t likely to be on this team after the 2024 season.
With Brandon Aiyuk playing on his fifth-year option and Deebo Samuel nearing a manageable trapdoor exit in his contract next offseason, you can see where this is going. Particularly after San Francisco drafted wideout Ricky Pearsall in the first round and Jacob Cowing in the fourth last week. The question now becomes “who” between that pair of Aiyuk and Samuel.
Given the level of punishment Samuel has taken over the course of his career and Aiyuk being the younger player who is now ascending into his prime, Samuel would appear to be the player who is made available next offseason … or potentially even into training camp. It's something to keep an eye on in the interim: Whether Aiyuk reports for mandatory minicamp in June, which could foreshadow a holdout (or hold in) during training camp.
A pair of wideout holdouts?
Like Aiyuk, eyes will be on Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson and Cincinnati Bengals wideout Tee Higgins. Jefferson is awaiting a monster contract extension that a few people inside the franchise believe should have been a bigger priority (and also gotten done) last offseason. One year later, the numbers have moved into the territory of Jefferson becoming the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history. That expectation didn’t lessen after the draft, with the Vikings needing their best offensive weapon on the field to help along the development of rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy. If there’s not progress on getting this deal done, it would not be a surprise to see Jefferson skip the team’s mandatory minicamp and then engage in a hold-in come training camp.
Higgins, on the other hand, didn’t have anything close to what his camp believed was a suitable contract extension offer prior to the Bengals applying the franchise tag to him. That makes it far less likely that even some significant holdout pressure could result in a deal getting done. If anything, a holdout by Higgins in mandatory minicamp and into training camp would be geared toward forcing a trade. Right now, the Bengals don’t have plans to make that kind of move. That means either Higgins shows up and plays out the tag, or digs in and creates enough of a scene to force a trade that appears very unlikely.
The Rashee Rice suspension
Rice will eventually be suspended by the NFL for a violation of the personal conduct policy, triggered by his road racing crash in Dallas earlier this offseason. That is not in dispute. The question is what the length of suspension will be and when it will happen. And that is entirely in the hands of the legal process.
Rice is facing eight felony counts related to the incident — one count of collision involving serious bodily injury, one count of aggravated assault, and six counts of collision involving injury. Of the eight counts, the most serious from a legal standing, is the charge tied to aggravated assault.
The presumption is that Rice’s legal team will eventually seek a plea deal that could ultimately be aided by any compensation he provides to the crash victims. The important part to understand here is that the legal process is just getting underway and could take months if not longer to snake toward some manner of trial. Delays in that process, which also always come into play, could push a resolution all the way into 2025.
That means Rice may not face any NFL discipline this season.
That said, it’s coming down the pipeline, with the measure of severity expected to be impacted by whatever comes out of the legal process and any measures that Rice and his legal team use to resolve his charges.

Several Utah representatives introduced legislation last week to withdraw a proposed rule from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that the agency says would promote conservation through the protection and restoration of certain landscapes, but that opponents say would stop state-level management of public lands and block land from important uses.
Reps. John Curtis, Celeste Maloy, Blake Moore and Burgess Owens and nine other members of Congress’ Western Caucus sponsored legislation to withdraw the rule, alleging it would limit access to public lands. The rule, titled “Conservation and Landscape Health,” was introduced in March and purportedly “lays groundwork for conserving wildlife habitat, restoring places impacted by wildfire and drought, expanding outdoor recreation, and thoughtful development,” according to an Interior Department press release.
Gov. Spencer Cox and several other governors have said they plan to sue the federal government over the new rule.
The sponsors of last week’s legislation said the BLM’s rule would have a disproportionate effect on Western states and citizens, as more than 90 percent of the 245 million acres controlled by the BLM are located in the West.
Curtis spoke about the bill on the House floor, where he spoke about Utah’s rural communities, and how they “work hard to feed our families, protect American energy, and lead in manufacturing.”
“We should be making it easier for them,” he continued. “Instead, the Biden administration is pushing this rule to allow environmental groups funded by Swiss billionaires who pretend to be representing Utah to lock up public lands. This is completely backwards… .”
Curtis said the new rule favors “wealthy individuals and environmental groups, allowing them to lock up land that belongs to all Utahns. I am pleased that the House voted in a bipartisan manner to pass my bill revoking its implementation.”
The rule proposes a number of regulations under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), including allowing environmental groups to lease land to close it off to other uses.
“The proposal is consistent with strategies used by other state and federal land management agencies to ensure the federal government has tools and direction to identify areas in need of restoration or conservation, as well as the ability to encourage investments in public lands to help balance the impacts of development,” the Interior Department press release states.
Although the release also claimed the rule would “increase access to outdoor education by putting conservation on equal footing with other uses,” the Western Caucus sponsors claimed it would actually limit recreational opportunities, as well as hinder access for energy and mineral development, grazing and forest management.
“In the West, we know locking up lands with preservationist designations does not automatically guarantee healthy landscapes. In fact, the opposite is often the case,” said Western Caucus Chairman Dan Newhouse. “Farmers and ranchers are the best stewards of the land, not bureaucrats in Washington who seek to hamper our land managers’ ability to conserve the land they rely on for their livelihoods.”

Article: If you were curious about what exactly happened to Shohei Ohtani's money after it was allegedly stolen by his former interpreter Ippei Mizuhara, a new report from ESPN's Tisha Thompson has shed new light on the situation.
The man at the center of the alleged illegal gambling ring that received Ohtani's money was run by a man named Mathew Bowyer, who has been under investigation by federal authorities since last year. Ohtani was only roped into the scandal when authorities noticed his bank information among the payments to Bowyer.
Mizuhara reportedly funneled weekly $500,000 payments from Ohtani's bank account to an associate of Bowyer's to cover his illegal gambling losses. ESPN reports that associate would then deposit the money into accounts with Resorts World, a Las Vegas casino opened in 2021, and Pechanga Resort Casinoi in Temecula, Calif.
Bowyer and the associate would then allegedly convert the money to playing chips, gamble with it and cash out if they won. Bowyer reportedly lost $7.9 million at Resorts World from June 22 to Oct. 2023, a span of time in which he was receiving money from Mizuhara.
This is all apparently part of a much larger trend in the gambling world, where illegal bookies in Southern California use Las Vegas casinos to launder the money. Twelve people have reportedly been charged and convicted while two Vegas casinos have agreed to pay fines.
There's even a tangential connection to LeBron James. The Los Angeles Lakers star's friend and business partner Maverick Carter reportedly admitted late last year that he bet on NBA games via an illegal bookie. ESPN reports that bookie, Wayne Nix, has since pleaded guilty to operating an illegal gambling business and filing a false tax return. NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen and former MLB star Yasiel Puig also reportedly made bets through Nix.
In the case of Bowyer, he reportedly boasted more than 600 bettors and was known as a whale in Vegas, with a reputation for bringing between $250,000 and $1 million with him as often as two or three times a month.
Where does the Shohei Ohtani scandal currently stand?
As far as Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers and MLB, the Ippei Mizuhara situation is in the rear-view mirror.
Mizuhara turned himself in on a federal charge of bank fraud earlier this month and is currently out on $25,000 bond. His attorney released a statement soon after indicating a desire to cut a deal with prosecutors rather than go to trial, where he would face up to 30 years in prison:
Today Mr. Mizuhara voluntarily surrendered, made his initial appearance, and was released on bond as agreed to with the government. He is continuing to cooperate with the legal process and is hopeful that he can reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.
He wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family. As noted in court, he is also eager to seek treatment for his gambling. We have no further comment at this time, but Mr. Mizuhara will be providing further comment as the legal process proceeds.
To date, no reports of a deal have materialized, but that doesn't mean negotiations aren't happening.
Meanwhile, MLB has released a statement recognizing that authorities see Ohtani as a victim, leaving them little to investigate.
This is about as good an outcome that Ohtani and his people could have hoped for after his name popped up on an illegal bookie's ledger, but remains a very sad situation. It's become clear that Mizuhara was both very close to Ohtani and suffered from enormous issues with gambling addiction.
Now, Ohtani is just focusing on baseball again, while Mizuhara is sorting out an unenviable legal situation.

Article: 7-DAY DEADLINE ALERT: The Schall Law Firm Encourages Investors in iRobot Corporation with Losses of $100,000 to Contact the Firm
LOS ANGELES, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Schall Law Firm, a national shareholder rights litigation firm, reminds investors of a class action lawsuit against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) for violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Investors who purchased the Company’s securities between August 5, 2022 and January 26, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), are encouraged to contact the firm before May 7, 2024.
If you are a shareholder who suffered a loss, click here to participate.
We also encourage you to contact Brian Schall of the Schall Law Firm, 2049 Century Park East, Suite 2460, Los Angeles, CA 90067, at 310-301-3335, to discuss your rights free of charge. You can also reach us through the firm's website at www.schallfirm.com, or by email at bschall@schallfirm.com.
The class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.
According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. iRobot’s merger with Amazon (“the Merger”) would give Amazon a dominant position in robot vacuum cleaners (“RVCs”), making it unlikely that American and European authorities would approve it. The Company failed to complete adequate due diligence on the Merger and ignored regulatory risks. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about iRobot, investors suffered damages.
Join the case to recover your losses.
The Schall Law Firm represents investors around the world and specializes in securities class action lawsuits and shareholder rights litigation.

Matt Harmon and Andy Behrens go where no pod has gone before after the NFL Draft. They identify the biggest winners and losers in the fantasy world. This is totally an original idea so don't fact check us. Behrens also reveals the four biggest debates he had when putting together his rookie dynasty rankings.
To start the show, Behrens shares his thoughts on the Bears dynamic draft that saw them snag Caleb Williams and Rome Odunze in the first and the Iowa punter in the fourth round. Being a Hawkeye alum, Behrens is over the moon with the Bears selections and is counting down the days to a Super Bowl parade.
The two then share, secret list style, their three biggest winners and losers from this year's NFL Draft with a focus on players that will now have to face competition from rookie teammates and those are look like they are in the clear for tons of volume. Both agree Las Vegas Raiders RB Zamir White might be the biggest winner of the draft while his new teammate Brock Bowers might be the biggest loser.
To end the show, Behrens shares the four biggest debates he had with himself when putting together his rookie dynasty rankings. Harmon and Behrens discuss the biggest hot button debates that will dominate dynasty rookie drafts this summer.

Article: Newswise — The border crossing separating San Diego, California, from Tijuana, Mexico, is a dynamic place. When it was closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, drug tourism from San Diego to Tijuana continued. This provided a flow of people in both directions, bringing with them not only the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) but also the virus that causes AIDS (HIV). A collaborative study led by researchers from University of California San Diego and Irvine, recently published in the Lancet, found that rather than preventing the spread of disease, closing the border actually increased the rate of HIV transmission.
Injection drug use increases the risk of HIV infection through the sharing of injection equipment. To investigate the dynamics between border closure, drug use and HIV transmission, Britt Skaathun, Ph.D., adjunct assistant professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine, and first author on the paper, led an effort that studied 618 participants from October 2020 to October 2021, focusing on three different groups: people who live in San Diego who cross the border to use drugs in Tijuana; people who live in San Diego and use drugs in San Diego; and people who live in Tijuana and use drugs in Tijuana.
Subjects first underwent interviews, answering questions about their demographics, drug use behaviors, sexual behaviors, sexual identity and border crossing behaviors. Every six months they gave blood samples and were tested for HIV and hepatitis C.
Tetyana Vasylyeva, D.Phil., assistant professor of population health and disease prevention at UC Irvine, and senior author on the study, analyzed the spread of HIV through the virus genetic data. Combining molecular epidemiology with the questionnaire answers, the scientists found that people were crossing the border in both directions and being exposed to HIV despite government efforts to keep the border closed. The scientists then deepened their analysis by applying advanced molecular techniques.
For every patient who tested HIV positive, Vasylyeva and her colleagues isolated the virus, sequenced its RNA and analyzed the genetic diversity in the border region. They investigated how closely the viruses were related genetically—a field of study called phylogenetics, in which scientists construct trees representing how viruses relate to each other.
After constructing viral phylogenetic trees, the scientists subjected them to a molecular clock analysis. Molecular clock is based on a theory that assumes organisms evolve with a relatively constant rate over time. In this case, applying the molecular clock to the phylogenetic trees enabled the scientists to estimate the timing of cross-border HIV transmission. That further enabled them to identify transmission clusters. “If two or three people have viruses that are very similar to each other, we can assume that the transmission event happened more recently, because there is not enough evolution between these different viruses from these different people,” explained Vasylyeva.
The next step was to combine the survey data and the phylodynamic data. They found that during the 18-month period of their study, nine people contracted HIV, mostly during the pandemic. “Nine sounds like a small number, but it's actually quite a lot of people because in the U.S., HIV incidence is relatively low. We were surprised to see this change in HIV status in such a short amount of time and wanted to look more closely at these clusters,” said Skaathun.
Applying a molecular clock to the clusters, they found a surprise: all of the new clusters had sequences from participants on both sides of the border, indicating that cross-border transmission was happening right when the border was closed. One cluster that grew despite the border closure included two people from San Diego that used drugs in Tijuana. “This shows that efforts to build a higher wall or policies to stop immigration will not mitigate HIV spread,” said Vasylyeva.
Structural risk is a social factor that increases harm. Skaathun says the current study shows that closing the border during the pandemic functioned as a structural risk factor. “The Frontera [border] is one integrated community that is not defined by place of residence. Efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S. also need to be integrated by extending to Tijuana,” she said.
In 2000, the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission was founded to “provide international leadership to improve health and quality of life along the U.S.-Mexico border.” Gudelia Rangel, Ph.D., serves as executive secretary for the commission. Rangel is also a co-author on the current study. “These findings confirm that HIV has no passport,” she says. Like her colleagues, she believes that establishing programs to eliminate HIV transmission at the border, such as harm reduction and substance use treatment services, is a more effective way of preventing viral spread than attempting to close a porous border.

Article: The Chicago area is likely going to escape the brunt of a system bringing strong-to-severe thunderstorms to the Great Plains on Tuesday, but pockets of gusty winds could cause tree damage, according to the National Weather Service.
That system has already sparked tornado watches in parts of Iowa and Missouri, with gusty winds and heavy rain also possible with those storms as they push toward the southeast.
As the midnight hour approaches, that system is expected to approach the Chicago area, but the storms are expected to dissipate, leaving only a chance for scattered showers if any precipitation does fall.
The threat of wind will still be present however, with wind gusts of 30-to-40 miles per hour possible overnight, according to NWS officials. “Isolated corridors” of high winds could also occur, with some gusts even exceeding 50 miles per hour.
Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.
Wind gusts of that speed have the potential to cause damage to trees and to power lines, with officials warning residents to be wary of the changing conditions between midnight and 4 a.m.
Breezy conditions are expected to persist in the area for several days, but conditions are expected to remain mostly dry on Wednesday and for most of Thursday, with several chances of rain impacting the area as the weekend approaches.
Stay tuned to the NBC 5 Storm Team for all the latest weather news and information.

Article: The first ever TV adaptation of C. J. Samson’s acclaimed "Shardlake" novels, starring Arthur Hughes as Tudor detective Matthew Shardlake, drops on Hulu from May 1. The four-part mini series centers around a gruesome murder at a monastery.
Out of the country when "Shardlake" season 1 debuts? Our guide below explains how to watch "Shardlake" online from anywhere with the help of a VPN.
Based on “Dissolution,” the first entry in Samson’s “Shardlake” saga, this brooding series introduces us to the hunchbacked-lawyer-turned-detective, who finds himself hired by Thomas Cromwell (Sean Bean) to solve a shocking murder.
Against the historic backdrop of Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries, the commissioner dispatched to St Donatus the Ascendent has been found dead – beheaded! It’s imperative that Shardlake, aided by Cromwell’s loyal henchman Jack (Anthony Boyle), expose the culprit and finish the commissioner’s job.
Adapted by Stephen Butchard (“The Last Kingdom”) and directed by Justin Chadwick (“The Other Boleyn Girl”), “Shardlake” promises to be a slam-dunk for murder-mystery fans. Not only does it boast an incredible cast, including “Game of Thrones” alumni Sean Bean as the ill-fated Cromwell and Paul Kaye as Brother Jerome, but it’s vividly evocative of the period.

Article: Newswise — LOS ANGELES (April 30, 2024) -- Artificial intelligence experts at Cedars-Sinai and the Smidt Heart Institute created a dataset with more than 1 million echocardiograms, or cardiac ultrasound videos, and their corresponding clinical interpretations. Using this database, they created EchoCLIP, a powerful machine learning algorithm that can “interpret” echocardiogram images and assess key findings.
The design and evaluation of EchoCLIP, described in a manuscript published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine, suggest that an EchoCLIP interpretation of a patient’s echocardiogram provides clinician-level evaluations of heart function, assessment of past surgeries and devices, and may assist clinicians in identifying patients in need of treatment. The EchoCLIP foundation model also can identify the same patient across multiple videos, studies and timepoints as well as recognize clinically important changes in a patient’s heart.
“To our knowledge, this is the largest model trained on echocardiography images,” said corresponding author David Ouyang, MD, a faculty member in the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute and in the Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine. “Many previous AI models for echocardiograms are only trained on tens of thousands of examples. In contrast, EchoCLIP’s uniquely strong performance in image interpretation is a result of its training on almost tenfold more data than existing models.”
“Our results suggest that large datasets of medical imaging and expert-adjudicated interpretations can serve as the basis for training medical foundation models, which are a form of generative artificial intelligence,” Ouyang said. He said this advanced foundation model can soon help cardiologists in the assessment of echocardiograms by generating preliminary assessments of cardiac measurements, identify changes that happen over time, and common disease states.
The team of investigators built a dataset of 1,032,975 cardiac ultrasound videos and corresponding expert interpretations to develop EchoCLIP. Key takeaways from the study include:
- EchoCLIP displayed strong performance when assessing cardiac function using heart images.
- The foundation model could identify implanted intracardiac devices like a pacemaker, implanted mitral valve repairs and aortic valves from the echocardiogram images.
- EchoCLIP accurately identified unique patients across studies, identified clinically important changes such as having undergone heart surgery, and enabled the development of a preliminary text interpretation of echocardiogram images.
“Foundation models are one of the newest areas within generative AI, but most models do not have enough medical data to be useful in the healthcare arena,” said Christine M. Albert, MD, MPH, chair of the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute and the Lee and Harold Kapelovitz Distinguished Chair in Cardiology.
Albert, who was not involved in the Nature Medicine study, said, “This novel foundation model integrates computer vision interpretation of echocardiogram images with natural language processing to augment cardiologists’ interpretation of echocardiograms.”
Cedars-Sinai investigator and first author Kai Christensen was also involved in the study. Other authors involved in the research include Milos Vukadinovic and Neal Yuan.
Ouyang is funded by NIH NHLBI grant R00HL157421.

Article: Jack Flaherty had a perfect start against his former team on Tuesday afternoon.
The Detroit Tigers pitcher matched an American League Record at Comerica Park when he recorded seven straight strikeouts to open their game against the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday.
By the time Flaherty was pulled from the mound in the seventh inning, he had a career-high 14 strikeouts. That matched Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow for the most thrown in a single game in the league this season, and the most thrown by a Tigers starter in a game in nearly a decade.
Only four other American League pitchers have struck out seven batters in a row to open a game. Luis Castillo was the most recent pitcher to pull that off in 2022. Miami Marlins pitcher Pablo Lopez holds the league record with nine.
"It was nice to come out and be in sync from pitch one," Flaherty said, via The Associated Press.
Despite Flaherty’s career day, the Cardinals rallied in the ninth behind RBIs from Alec Burleson and Pedro Pagés to pick up the 2-1 win.
Flaherty signed a one-year, $14 million deal with the Tigers this past offseason after spending most of his career with the Cardinals — who selected him in the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft. He made his debut with the club in 2017, and spent more than six seasons there before he was dealt to the Baltimore Orioles there. He went 8-9 with a 4.99 ERA in 27 starts last season.
The 28-year-old has yet to pick up a win in his six starts with the Tigers, but he has 50 strikeouts and five walks over 36 innings on the mound.
"He was on, and it was nasty," Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said, via The Associated Press. "He had his stuff."
The loss dropped the Tigers to 16-13 on the season, and marked their third loss in their last five outings. The Tigers and Cardinals, who ran it back immediately on Tuesday for a doubleheader after Monday’s contest was postponed, will wrap up their three-game series on Wednesday afternoon.

Rep. Shri Thanedar's campaign is alleging one of his most significant primary challengers failed to submit enough valid petition signatures to appear on the Democratic primary ballot for Michigan's 13th Congressional District this August.
In a news release sent Tuesday evening, the Democratic congressman from Detroit's reelection campaign says it's challenging the petition signatures submitted by Adam Hollier, a former state senator who finished second to Thanedar in the Aug. 2022 primary for the 13th District. Hollier, however, told the Free Press Thanedar is attempting to disenfranchise voters and is using "legal tricks" to keep him off the ballot.
Thanedar's campaign says it's challenging 791 of the approximately 1,555 signatures submitted by Hollier's campaign. It alleges several reasons why the signatures shouldn't be accepted, including potential duplicate signatures, signatures from voters registered outside the 13th District, signatures from people not registered to vote or registered at wrong addresses and potentially forged signatures.
"Some of the signatures, the handwriting, look like just one person doing it all," Thanedar said in a Tuesday interview. "It just looks, in general, like the quality of the work seems questionable."
Longtime Michigan political consultant Mark Grebner reviewed the signatures at Thanedar's request, according to an affidavit submitted by his campaign.
Thanedar's campaign says it's asked the Wayne County Clerk's office to investigate the signatures. Ultimately, it's the Board of State Canvassers that will determine who appears on the August primary ballot.
If the signature challenge is unsuccessful and Hollier ends up on the primary ballot, Thanedar said "(w)e'll be happy to engage and show the voters the work that I have done in the job for nearly a year and a half now."
The 13th District covers part of Detroit, several Downriver communities and most of the Grosse Pointe communities. Its heavily Democratic lean makes the primary extremely competitive.
Hollier is one of four primary challengers vying to oust Thanedar after a single term, in a field that also includes Detroit City Councilwoman Mary Waters. He received the second-most votes among five Democratic candidates in the 2022 primary, receiving nearly 3,800, or almost 5%, fewer votes than Thanedar.
He's touted several notable endorsements, including from Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and former U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, among others. Hollier said he ultimately believes he will end up on the primary ballot, despite Thanedar's challenge.
"I think Detroiters and people in the 13th Congressional District should be deeply frustrated that their Congressmember is trying to disenfranchise their ability to vote," Hollier said.
Along with Hollier and Waters, attorney Shakira Lynn Hawkins is running in the Democratic primary to challenge Thanedar, according to the Secretary of State's office.

Article: One of only two World Tour races in Germany, the Eschborn-Frankfurt is sticking to the course used last year set over more than 200km with two climbs of the Feldberg and three of the Mammolshainer Stich. It is officially the final classic race of the Spring so read on and we'll show you how to watch Eschborn-Frankfurt 2024 live streams from anywhere with a VPN, and potentially for FREE.
The 61st edition of this classic German race is held in and to the north west of Frankfurt. It compromises multiple laps of a series of loops around the outskirts of the city. Dominated by two climbs, the first of which is the 11km Feldberg, set on an average gradient of 4.8%, and that is followed 50km later by twin ascents of the shorter but much steeper 2.3km Mammolshain climb.
After, this the race returns once more to the slopes of the Feldberg before a final ascent of the Mammolshain some 40km from the finish line. This large distance to the end should allow gapped riders to re-join the front of the race and form a small group to fight out a sprint finish.
The key protagonists this year are going to be March Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates), Maximilian Schachmann and Emil Herzog both (BORA - hansgrohe), Mathias Vacek (Lidl - Trek) and Laurenz Rex (Intermarché - Wanty).

Article: BUFFALO, N.Y. — (AP) — Democratic state Sen. Timothy Kennedy won a special election Tuesday for the New York congressional seat vacated by Democrat Brian Higgins.
Kennedy defeated Republican Gary Dickson for the upstate New York seat, helped by a 2-to-1 Democratic registration advantage in the district, which includes Buffalo, Niagara Falls and several suburbs.
Kennedy has been in the state Senate since 2011. Describing Washington as "chaotic and dysfunctional," he said he would focus in Congress on reproductive rights, immigration and stronger gun laws like those passed in New York after a 2022 mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket.
“New York has been a bulwark against Donald Trump’s extremist MAGA agenda that has infected our politics and our nation’s capital,” he said during the campaign. “The MAGA extremists have made the House of Representatives a laughingstock.”
Registration wasn't Kennedy's only advantage. The Democrat raised $1.7 million as of April 10, compared with Dickson's $35,430 total, according to campaign finance reports. Kennedy spent just over $1 million in the off-season election, compared with $21,000 for Dickson as the candidates worked to remind voters to go to the polls.
Kennedy will serve in Congress for the rest of the year. He is on the ballot, along with Republican attorney Anthony Marecki, for the general election. On Tuesday, former town supervisor Nate McMurray, who planned to challenge Kennedy in a Democratic primary in June, said in a social media post that elections officials had removed him from the ballot because of insufficient signatures.
Earlier this year, the GOP's slim House majority was narrowed in a closely contested Long Island-area special election that followed New York Republican George Santos' expulsion from Congress. That race, won by Democrat Tom Suozzi, was viewed as a test of the parties' general election strategies on immigration and abortion.
Dickson, a retired FBI special agent, acknowledged the challenges of running in the upstate district when he announced his candidacy at the end of February, saying he was in the race to give voters a choice. He said he supports Trump as the Republican nominee for president, while describing his own politics as “more towards the center.”

Article: Apr. 30—Ector County ISD's Special Services Department is facing a lot of challenges from trying to clear up a backlog of referrals to the way it handles discipline.
At a recent ECISD Board of Trustees workshop, the board discussed discipline for multi-racial special education students. This is called significant disproportionality. Mark Gabrylczyk, executive director of special services, said they went over the risk ratio for discipline of a population of ECISD students compared to other students in the district.
When a district goes over the risk ratio, the state tells them they are being flagged for a disproportionality issue. The district has three years to fix it. If a district has three continual years of significant disproportionality, which ECISD has, the state puts the program in Targeted Assistance.
Gabrylczyk now has a meeting with the Texas Education Agency once a month to talk about how they are going to improve the risk ratio within that group of students. TEA had Gabrylczyk put together a plan that includes professional development for administrators and teachers where certain milestones have to be met.
"In addition, there's a financial element to it. The state is going to take 15 percent of the special education budget and it is now being allotted to fixing the issue of significant disproportionality. So 15 percent of the special education budget is significant in our case because it's close to $1 million. That $1 million needs to be spent on fixing that issue instead of being reinvested into another strategy or project that we need to tackle. So it's a big deal," he added.
The special education budget is about $6 million and it is separate from the general fund. It is made up of state and federal funds, which is "very controlled by the state, which is very controlled by the federal government," Gabrylczyk said. They have to use all 15 percent to fix the risk ratio.
He added that special education is very regulated and it's a complex part of the district.
"Because you're dealing with legal issues, you're dealing with financial issues, you're dealing with programming issues, you're dealing with eligibility issues. On top of that, you're dealing with kids who may have a learning disability to kids who are medically fragile," Gabrylczyk said.
Special Services also faces a backlog of evaluations. Gabrylczyk said they started the year with a carryover of 706 evaluations from last year. That didn't include any new evaluations that they were getting for this school year.
"This school year ... to date, we have received 726 new referrals. When we combine the carryover with the new referrals, we're sitting at over 1,400 referrals that we need to get done," Gabrylczyk said.
They have 570 referrals that had been completed and 436 referrals that are currently being evaluated. That means that the diagnostician, licensed specialist in school psychology, or the speech pathologist has the file folder and they've started the evaluation process, he said.
They have 900 of the 1,400 evaluations done. They have 21 diagnosticians, some of whom work virtually for the district, the others work on ECISD campuses. They have one licensed specialist in school psychology currently,
"Yes, we've done a lot of work in this area, but we still have a lot of work to do," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that the evaluation process takes a long time.
"When we receive a referral, we have 15 days to determine whether or not we're going to evaluate a student. If we decide to evaluate the student, we move forward with the evaluation and getting the consent signed to evaluate the student. If we decide not to evaluate the student, we inform the parents that we're not going to evaluate the student. So there's a 15-day window that we have for parents," Gabrylczyk said.
Special Education Supervisor Amanda Napolean said when a parent requests an evaluation, they have 15 school days to offer consent or decline to evaluate.
They have 45 school days to complete the evaluation and get the report written. They have 30 calendar days to meet on the results of the evaluation, Napolean said.
Gabrylczyk said they will be conducting evaluations over the summer. Napolean said they did them over spring break. The office was open for nine days, including weekends.
The state recently changed eligibility requirements for special education in the area of dyslexia, behavior and autism.
"It's a huge increase to what has been done in the past, not only in our school district but also throughout of the state of Texas," Gabrylczyk said.
Special Services has a process it uses to determine if students are eligible for special education.
"For example we will look at attendance, does the student have attendance issues? What are the student's academic strengths and what are their academic concerns? This is where the teacher will provide us information," Gabrylczyk said.
"We look at their MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) scores, which is really, really important. We look at their STAAR results, which is really, really important. We also look at their basic reading, math, spelling and writing scores on assessments that we give our kids. Are they weak or are they really strong?" he added.
They use a scale of 1 to 4 with 4 being the strongest and one the weakest.
"We look at for an example if the student is bilingual, or multilingual, we look at their TELPAS scores. We want to make sure that we're making consideration for both English and the Spanish language. We look at their vision screens. We look at their hearing screens. If it's a student who needs physical therapy or occupational therapy, we will go ahead and look at that," Gabrylczyk said.
"In the areas of speech, we look at their language fluency, their articulation, and also their voice," he added.
Schools use Mult-tiered Systems of Support. This replaced Response to Intervention, which focused on a student's academics.
The Multi-tiered Systems of Support looks at the whole child, including academics and behavior.
"What we also do is we look at the behavior of the kid; we look at the grade level of the students, and then we take all of this information ... and it goes to what we call a referral committee. Amanda (Napolean) sits on the referral committee," Gabrylczyk said.
Napolean said the referral committee includes the two lead diagnosticians, the two lead speech therapists, Napolean and another special services supervisor.
Napolean said she was previously a diagnostician and the other lead special education supervisor was previously a school psychologist.
The six review committee members review every file that comes in from campuses and parent requests. They take the information and make a recommendation of where to start the evaluation. If the data supports a possible learning disability, the information will be funneled down that path. If it supports autism, the information will be funneled down that path.
"From there, then we distribute them out to the evaluators to get consent and get rolling on the evaluation as quickly as possible," Napolean said.
What makes them decline to move forward with an evaluation is when, for example, a parent says their child was commended on the STAAR test last year and they just approached this year and the parent is worried about a disability, Napolean said.
When she looks through the data, Napolean said she can see that the data does not support a disability.
"It's in those those instances where ... it looks more of like a fluke than a pattern.That's what we're looking for is that true incidence of disability because that is something we take very seriously. It's a label that stays with a child forever. Anytime we see potentially that there is a disability, we will absolutely investigate to make sure," Napolean said.
Gabrylczyk said the law gives the special services department the opportunity to say they are going to evaluate a student, or they're not.
"That's why I think school districts throughout the state of Texas are really struggling, is because we have many of those types of situations," he added.
Napolean said when a student is declined, the department has to produce a notice of refusal.
"In that prior written notice, we have to outline the reason we are not accepting the request and that is exactly what we do. We say STAAR scores were this; MAP scores were this. In comparison to grade level peers, this student is not functioning below level and so we outline that very clearly and we send that to the parent. But yes, that takes a lot of time and effort as well," she added.
Parents and teachers can refer students to special services.
Napolean said teachers referring is the preferred way.
"When I say preferred, I'm not discounting anything that a parent would do. But when we get teacher requests for evaluations, we get a lot of data from the campus where they have compiled efforts of different strategies that they've tried and so as an assessor, when I get a referral that shows that they tried to teach it this way, realized the student didn't get it; tried to teach it this way, realized the student didn't get it. That is great data for me," Napolean said.
"As I start to evaluate, it helps me determine which battery would be a good measure for that student. It also tells me that it's not a knee jerk reaction ... They have tried some things first, and so it allows me as the evaluator to include that information in my report. There is a path to eligibility in the state of Texas that is lack of response to intervention. That is data in my report that I can include that says, we have formally evaluated but we also have evidence of lack of response to intervention and we feel this student needs additional supports. When I have a teacher request versus a parent request, I get all of that data and it helps me get to the bottom of that student's learning difficulties," she added.
Gabrylczyk noted that a lot of things happen in students' lives that may throw them off their academic progress.
"We know that kids have significant challenges in life, so when we see a student that, again, is doing really well, and they're scoring and then all of a sudden we see this difference. It is a concern and we take those concerns very seriously. But on the other hand, we also do have students who do have legitimate learning disabilities, and we want to do whatever we can to help them be successful in school. That's the thing about special education. Special education isn't a placement. It's a service that we provide and we all need to remember that all students are general education students first, with special education as a service, not a placement," he added.
Gabrylczyk said things have really changed over the years.
"There's been tons of court cases that went up to the Supreme Court that have really established precedents in what we do and how we do things and school systems in the area of special education. It's a very complex program in dealing with some of the situations that we deal with," he added.
Special Services serves 4,134 students and that figure is increasing.
"It's climbing because what we're seeing is about 80% of those referrals that we receive are kids going into special education and that's alarming. People always ask, why is that? Why is that happening? Nobody really has an answer and I wouldn't even feel comfortable addressing it," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that when a student is referred for special education and the decision is made to evaluate that student, that student is afforded specific protections under Section 504 of the ADA law. What those protections are, for an example, the student needs to be receiving accommodations, the students need to be receiving modifications. Even though the student hasn't qualified for special ed services yet there are protections that still need to happen with the student. What we tell our schools is this, you have a referral and yes, we're going to evaluate the student, but you need to have a plan moving forward and how you're going to accommodate and modify for this particular student," Gabrylczyk said.
The Texas Education Agency website says, "Section 504 requires that school districts provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to qualified students in their jurisdictions who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities."
"People always wonder what percentage of students should be what we determine is eligible for special ed services in school districts. Usually that number is between 10 and 12%. We're now above the 10% threshold ... so that's concerning," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that there has always been a push and pull between the federal and state government.
"If you remember back to 2016, the federal government came into the state of Texas and said, you're not qualifying enough kids. You're at 8%. Then all of a sudden, as Amanda told you this morning, there's been a change in the regulation. Now we're looking at the number is swinging to the other side of the pendulum where there's probably going to be a time where the feds come back into the state saying, well, now you're over identifying kids. So there's kind of that sweet spot, again, between 10 and 12% where we really want to be with eligibility," Gabrylczyk said.
On behavior, he said, the district has students with significant issues with behavior and they do things that are not aligned with district expectations. Gabrylczyk said there has been an increase in behavior issues, but there is no one reason for that.
Special education students fall under district policies and procedures for up to 10 days.
"A principal can discipline a student for up to 10 days for violation of policy. Once they get to that 10th day there's a mechanism within special education law called Manifestation of Determination. What we do with that Manifest Determination mechanism is call a meeting with parents, school officials and sometimes if the student is for an example, at the high school level, they will be invited to the meeting to review what is happening with the student in the areas of behavior," Gabrylczyk said.
"For an example if we are seeing a trend with the behavior, that meeting is established not for discipline, consequences but for change of placement. Is this the correct placement for the student who's having these issues? Because we've suspended the student for 10 days ... Maybe this environment is not the right environment for the student, so we have that MDR meeting, manifest determination review meeting, to determine the placement for that student. Do we move a student from a less restrictive environment to a more restrictive environment? That's what we do with that meeting. That team looks at all the data and makes that determination whether or not that student's disability had an effect on why that student did the discipline," Gabrylczyk said.
There are cases where the disability did not have an effect on the behavior. If that's the case, the student is disciplined accordingly to district policies.
"If the student's disability had an effect on the behavior, then this student is placed right where they're at and stay put. Then what we have to do as a school system is develop a plan — a better plan — to curb and eliminate that behavior and to make sure that that student is making progress in that particular area," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that no special education students can be expelled.
"What ends up happening is we have what we call special circumstances. If you have a special education student, for example, who was trafficking drugs on a campus, that is considered a special circumstance. Another special circumstance is a student who brings a weapon on campus. That is a special circumstance and then the last special circumstance deals with whether or not there was bodily harm done to either a student or a staff member," Gabrylczyk said.
"That would be a special circumstance. For an example, when you're looking at that particular special circumstance, the law says that that student assault on an individual has to have had severe bodily harm on that student. We've been advised by our attorneys who interpret the law for us ...," it's like a hospitalization; a near death experience, he added.
Gabrylczyk said a fight doesn't necessarily constitute a special circumstance.
"Even if a student is taken to a hospital or staff members taken to a hospital, that still may not be good enough, but what we've been told by our attorneys is if there's an ambulance that's involved, there could be some issues within that element of that special circumstance," he added.
Students that fall under special circumstances are placed in the Alternative Education Center for a certain amount of days.
"But with that discipline, they can't go over 40 days without having another hearing, and so more than likely the student is going to have their due process rights heard and then a decision will be made within that meeting," Gabrylczyk said.
"School discipline, and judicial discipline are two separate things. We tend to like to integrate it. So you could have a student who assaults somebody and they could end up in the judicial system ... But the only thing we're responsible for is what the law is pertaining to schools and school districts," Gabrylczyk said.

Article: The Borussia Dortmund vs PSG live stream is the first leg of what promises to be a fascinating Champions League semi-final clash between the old and the new of European soccer. You can watch it live from anywhere with a VPN.
Dortmund, who last lifted this trophy in 1997, have been consistently inconsistent in 2023/24. Edin Terzic's side have picked up four points from their last 12 domestically to drop to fifth, the weekend's 4-1 hammering at rivals RB Leipzig a devastating blow. BVB's goalscorer was Jadon Sancho, who fired his 40th Bundesliga strike to become the top-scoring Englishman in the German top flight. The Man United loanee is finding his feet back at Westfalendstadion and will be determined to put in another thrilling attacking display.
Crowned French champions for a record-extending 12th time at the weekend, PSG have their eyes firmly fixed on the prize they covet most. Since the Parisians' acquisition by Qatari backers in 2011, Champions League victory has been the goal. In the quarter-finals, Kylian Mbappe led the charge with a superb second-leg showing to win 4-1 in Barcelona and avenge the memory of 2017's injury-time capitulation. The 25-year-old will want to cement his status atop the European footballing tree.
The group stage fixtures between the sides late last year finished with a 1-1 draw in Dortmund and a 2-0 PSG win in the French capital. What will happen when it matters most? Make sure you don’t miss a single game by checking out how to watch Champions League live streams.

Article: NEW ORLEANS — (AP) — A new congressional map giving Louisiana a second majority-Black House district was rejected Tuesday by a panel of three federal judges, fueling new uncertainty about district boundaries as the state prepares for fall congressional elections.
The 2-1 ruling forbids the use of a map drawn up in January by the Legislature after a different federal judge blocked a map from 2022. The earlier map maintained a single Black-majority district and five mostly white districts, in a state with a population that is about one-third Black.
The National Democratic Redistricting Committee said backers of the new map will likely seek an emergency order from the U.S. Supreme Court to keep the new map in place while appeals are pursued.
U.S. District Judges David Joseph and Robert Summerhays, both of whom were nominated to the bench by former President Donald Trump, said the newest map violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because “race was the predominate factor” driving its creation.
Judge Carl Stewart dissented, saying the majority gave too little weight to the political motivations involved in drawing the map.
“The panel majority is correct in noting that this is a mixed motive case,” Stewart wrote. “But to note this and then to subsequently make a conclusory determination as to racial predominance is hard to comprehend.”
The ruling means continued uncertainty over what the November election map will look like. Another federal district judge, Shelly Dick of Baton Rouge, has ruled that the state is likely in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act because it divides Black voters not included in majority-Black District 2 among five other congressional districts.
But Tuesday's ruling from the divided federal panel noted that “outside of southeast Louisiana, the State’s Black population is dispersed." The majority criticized the new mostly Black district, which stretched across the state from Shreveport in the northwest into southeast Louisiana, linking black populations from the Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge metro areas.
Joseph and Summerhays said they would not rule on the feasibility of creating a second majority-Black district that would comply with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
“However, we do emphasize that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act never requires race to predominate in drawing Congressional districts at the sacrifice of traditional districting principles,” they wrote.
The panel set a May 6 status conference. Meanwhile, the case before Judge Dick in Baton Rouge is still alive, and state election officials say they need to know the district boundaries by May 15. The sign-up period for the fall elections in Louisiana is in mid-July.
The decision gives new hope to Rep. Garret Graves, a white Republican incumbent whose district was seriously altered by the new map. And it raises questions for state Sen. Cleo Fields, a Democrat and former Congress member who had declared he would run in the new district.
Rep. Troy Carter, the only Democrat and only Black member of the state's current congressional delegation, criticized the ruling.
“This is just plain WRONG,” Carter posted on the social platform X on Tuesday evening.
The new map maintains safe districts for five incumbents: Carter and four white Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise. It was challenged by 12 self-described non-African American voters, whose lawsuit said the districts amounted to unconstitutional racial gerrymandering.
Supporters of the new map said politics, not race, was the main factor driving its creation — and that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry’s support for it bolstered that argument. The plan had put Graves, who supported an opponent of Landry in last fall’s governor’s race, at a disadvantage.
The Associated Press left a telephone message seeking comment with Landry's office Tuesday night.
The majority in Tuesday's opinion acknowledged the argument. “However, given the slim majority Republicans hold in the United States House of Representatives, even if such personal or intra-party animosity did or does exist, it is difficult to fathom that Louisiana Republicans would intentionally concede a seat to a Democratic candidate on those bases,” they wrote.
The ruling was the latest development in a drawn-out legal battle over redistricting, which happens every 10 years to account for population shifts reflected in census data.
Louisiana’s Republican-dominated Legislature drew a new map in 2022 that was favorable to all six current incumbents. Then-Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, vetoed the map, but the majority-Republican Legislature overrode him, leading to a court challenge.
In June 2022, Dick issued an injunction against the map, saying challengers would likely win their claim that it violated the Voting Rights Act. As the case was appealed, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an unexpected ruling that favored Black voters in a congressional redistricting case in Alabama.
Dick sided with challengers who said the 2022 map packed a significant number of voters in one district — District 2 which stretches from New Orleans to the Baton Rouge area — while “cracking” the remaining Black population by apportioning it to other mostly white districts.
Last November, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave the state a January deadline for drawing a new congressional district. Landry, who was the state’s attorney general when he was elected to succeed the term-limited Edwards, called a special session to redraw the map, saying the Legislature should do it rather than a federal judge.
The new map does not resemble sample maps that supporters of a new majority-Black district suggested earlier, which would have created a new district largely covering the northeastern part of the state.
The opponents of the latest map filed their lawsuit in the federal court system’s Western District of Louisiana, which is dominated by Republican-appointed judges. Dick was nominated to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama. Stewart, the dissenter on the panel, was nominated to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by former President Bill Clinton.
Such cases involving constitutional issues and remapping are often assigned to panels of two district judges and an appeals court circuit judge.

Article: The world of college sports is known to spotlight some of the most talented athletes who dazzle us with their skills on the court or field. But what about their lives off the playing field? Connor McCaffery, the multi-talented athlete from the University of Iowa, and Caitlin Clark, a standout player for the University of Iowa women's basketball team, have garnered attention not only for their sporting prowess but also for their beautiful relationship. The lovers recently celebrated their one-year anniversary, as McCaffery shared a glimpse of their happy times in a sweet Instagram post. Here’s all you need to know about Clark’s boyfriend.
Connor McCaffery’s Background
Connor McCaffery is a name synonymous with dedication in collegiate sports. Born on July 13, 1998, in Iowa City, Iowa, Connor grew up in a family deeply ingrained in sports. His father, Fran McCaffery, has been the head coach of the University of Iowa men’s basketball team since 2010. His mother, Margeret McCaffery, also played college basketball at the University of Notre Dame. It's no wonder that athletics runs in Connor's blood.
Connor began making waves early in his athletic career. Excelling in both basketball and baseball, he was a highly sought-after recruit out of high school. Ultimately, he chose to attend the University of Iowa. Now, he has become a key player for the Hawkeyes' basketball team. On the court, Connor McCaffery's skills are evident. As a point guard for the Hawkeyes, Connor has showcased his leadership qualities and basketball IQ, contributing significantly to the team's success.
Hawkeye Baseball Player
Before focusing solely on college basketball, McCaffery also showcased great baseball talent. He played for the Hawkeye baseball team. Playing both corner outfield spots and first base, McCaffery often made local headlines for his plays. Although he had the potential to go big in the sport and could’ve been drafted into the Major League, his injuries and health complications hindered him. Furthermore, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, it put a stop to the baseball season that year.
Joining The Indiana Pacers
As a sports genius, McCaffery didn’t stop at just playing basketball and baseball. He has also become involved in the NBA’s Indiana Pacers. Following his graduation from the University of Iowa in May 2023, McCaffery embarked on a new chapter by joining the Indiana Pacers as a team assistant. Balancing rigorous training and competitions with his basketball and baseball teams, he also pursued degrees in finance and political science.
Connor McCaffery And Caitlin Clark
Connor McCaffery and Caitlin Clark began dating in April 2023, forming a power couple in the world of collegiate athletics. However, they chose to keep their relationship private for several months before making it public. It wasn't until Clark posted a photo with McCaffery on her Instagram in August that their fans learned about their romance. In the relationship debut photo, the two were cuddled up in a boat, and Clark captioned it: “Best end to summer.”
McCaffery on the other hand, waited until Clark’s birthday on January 22, to post her on his Instagram account. Wishing her a happy birthday, he wrote: “Happy Birthday 22. Wish I was there to celebrate with you — you deserve the best day. Golden Bday / T Swift year will be the best yet. With all that you’ve already accomplished, there is so much more in store for you and your special self. I admire you in every way and I love you.” Months later, the two lovebirds celebrated their first anniversary, with McCaffery penning a lovely post to the woman with his heart. The post read: “One year w the best. Doing life w u has been easy, and you never cease to amaze me… can’t wait to watch u live out urdreams in person. Love you.”

Article: Police surround Columbia University as antiwar protests grow at U.S. campuses
Updated April 30, 2024 at 21:15 PM ET
New York police surrounded Columbia University and activists put out calls for more protestors on social media as the chaotic pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus appeared to reach a turning point late Tuesday.
Protesters have occupied the central campus building of Hamilton Hall for most of Tuesday, after the school asked them to voluntarily disperse from an encampment.
The NYPD, with some officers seen in riot gear and carrying zip tie handcuffs, blocked off sections of Broadway near the Columbia Morningside campus late Tuesday.
Activists asked supporters on social media to "mobilize." And people have shown up. A large crowd of protesters gathered outside of the gates of the campus Tuesday evening.
The tensions are one snapshot of protests erupting at college campuses across the U.S. The students are calling for universities to sell off their investments in companies that have businesses or investments in Israel because of the country's invasion of Gaza.
The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, while Israel says some 1,200 Israelis were killed by Hamas in an assault last October. Israel says Hamas is still holding 133 hostages.
Columbia has started suspending the students who have refused to leave and they now face expulsion.
In announcing the disciplinary actions, the school saidon Tuesday that the protesters "have chosen to escalate to an untenable situation."
Two prominent New York Democrats, U.S. Reps. Jerry Nadler and Adriano Espailla, called on the school to "move quickly and swiftly to remove the students who have engaged in unlawful activity."
They wrote in a shared statement that the students are entitled to free speech, but criticized recent actions of the demonstrations at Columbia.
On the other side of the U.S., students broke into the library at Portland State University in Oregon, triggering a campus-wide shutdown.
Many such demonstrations continue with no end in sight, but administrations at Northwestern University and Brown University managed to strike deals with protesters that included agreements to examine the schools' investments.
Campuses see big protests across the U.S.
In Oregon, Portland State University closed its campus on Tuesday, after demonstrators took over the school's library. The protesters broke into the Branford Price Millar Library during the night, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports.
Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt's office said his position is that "the actions taking place have crossed into criminal behavior, and we will prosecute."
Earlier on Tuesday at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, police arrested demonstrators who refused to shut down a "Gaza Solidarity Encampment" protest that began at the Polk Place quad on campus Friday.
Police detained some 30 protesters and moved them elsewhere on campus, according to student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel, which says six people in the group were arrested. Video posted on Instagram by the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine showed UNC police chief Brian James informing protesters that they were trespassing, as they chanted, "We will not stop, we will not rest."
UNC interim Chancellor Lee Roberts and Provost Christopher Clemens sent a letter early Tuesday ordering protesters to dismantle the camp and leave, threatening arrests and potential expulsion.
On Monday, police arrested nearly 80 people protesting in support of Palestinians at the University of Texas at Austin after demonstrators set up an encampment on the south lawn, according to member station KUT.
"Police and troopers in riot gear surrounded the protesters and made arrests," KUT reports.
UT Austin says that protesters "escalated by becoming physically and verbally combative" when approached, adding that it moved against the encampment because demonstrators' tents violated school rules. The arrests were for trespassing or disorderly conduct, it said.
The Palestine Solidarity Committee in Austin, a group organizing protests, condemned school president Jay Hartzell's administration for "yet again calling police to violently suppress students" — a reference to dozens of arrests made last Wednesday.
Along with its demands related to Israel and the Palestinians, the group says Hartzell — who has Gov. Greg Abbott's support — must resign. The group says it plans to hold another demonstration on Wednesday at noon, local time.
Northwestern and Brown reach agreements with protestors
This week Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and, as of Tuesday, Brown University in Rhode Island reached deals with student protesters to deescalate the demonstrations.
Brown President Christina Paxson shared details on the agreement in a campus-wide message on Tuesday.
"The devastation and loss of life in the Middle East has prompted many to call for meaningful change, while also raising real issues about how best to accomplish this," Paxson wrote. "Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog, debate and listening to each other."
Students of the Brown Divest Coalition set up an unauthorized encampment on the school's College Green on April 24, according to the university. With this new deal to deescalate protests, the students have agreed to end the encampment by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Additionally, they will refrain from any further actions "that would violate Brown's conduct code" through the end of the school year, including Commencement and Reunion Weekend.
In return, the school said it would invite five students to meet with five members of the Corporation of Brown University, the University's governing body that includes a Board of Trustees and a Board of Fellows, in May. The students will be allowed to hold a presentation on why Brown's endowment should divest from "companies enabling and profiting from the genocide in Gaza," the agreement stated.
Paxson said she will also ask the Advisory Committee on University Resources Management, the panel responsible for reviewing whether Brown's business and investment practices follow ethical and moral standards consistent with the school's goals and values, to provide a recommendation on divestment by Sept. 30, which will then be brought to the Corporation for a vote at its October meeting.
Dozens of tents set up by protesters at Northwestern in Evanston have been removed from the school's Deering Meadow, after a pro-Palestinian coalition agreed to a deal with school leaders on Monday.
Under the agreement, the Northwestern Divestment Coalition can continue to organize limited protests through at least June 1. Protesters who aren't affiliated with the school are also barred from participating.
In return, the school agreed to transparency measures around its investments, to give support to Middle Eastern and Muslim students, and to fund the "full cost of attendance for five Palestinian undergraduates" to attend the school for four years, along with two visiting Palestinian faculty for two years.
The university also said it will look to add more support for Jewish students. It called recent reports of antisemitic and anti-Muslim/Palestinian incidents "unacceptable."
The school said its goal was to "ensure that the violence and escalation we have seen elsewhere does not happen here at Northwestern."
Columbia and protesters hit a new impasse on Monday
While demonstrators elsewhere have reached deals with their schools' administrations, campus officials at Columbia have rejected student demands to divest from companies operating in Israel.
So, students entered Hamilton Hall early Tuesday morning, chained and barricaded its doors and have been using a rope system to get supplies from supporters, reported WKCR, the university radio station.
Outside, a crowd cheered as the facade was draped with signs reading "Intifada" and "Hind's Hall" — the latter a reference to Hind Rajab, a young Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza in January.
The university is now under what amounts to a lockdown of the campus in Manhattan's Morningside Heights, with access restricted to essential-service employees and students who live in residential halls on the campus.
"This building has now been liberated," an Instagram account affiliated with the student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest announced as it posted an image of Hamilton Hall, echoing language used during a 1968 protest.
Columbia students protesting racism against Black people and the Vietnam War were occupying Hamilton Hall and other buildings exactly 56 years ago — on April 30, 1968 — when police violently cleared the campus. More than 700 people were arrested and almost 150 people were injured.
The New York Police Department says it has officers stationed outside the university, but not on school grounds.
Tuesday's campus shutdown was mirrored by one at Barnard College, which is closely affiliated with Columbia.
Columbia's leadership has set several deadlines as it seeks to reach an agreement with demonstrators to end the encampment, as the school said it violates school policies and is a threat to campus safety, a disturbance to Jewish students and students trying to study and sleep.
Columbia seeks ways to hold graduation ceremony
Columbia's last day of classes for the spring semester was Monday, marking the start of "reading week," in which students traditionally prepare for looming final exams. Those exams are currently set to begin on Friday, with commencement planned for May 15.
Columbia President Minouche Shafik said on Monday that she wanted the protesters to "disperse voluntarily," urging them to consider that the graduating class of 2024 did not get to have their high school commencement ceremonies in person due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The president also said the school was prepared to allow demonstrations to resume after exams and commencement. But, Shafik added, protesters would need to submit an application at least two days in advance, and protests would be allowed only in designated areas.
Shafik said Columbia has supported protests and vigils that happened earlier in the year, as they were peaceful and didn't disturb campus operations.
But she added the encampment has caused an "unwelcoming environment" and "hostile environment" for Jewish students, and violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws discrimination at schools that receive federal funding.

Article: Members of Fort Worth’s ad hoc council committee on emergency medical response have recommended that MedStar employees who transition to the proposed fire department-based EMS model receive civil service benefits.
Michael Glynn, president of the Fort Worth Professional Firefighters Association, called the decision “the right thing to do,” and said it sends a message that Fort Worth is committed to caring for its EMS employees.
Tuesday’s decision comes two weeks after the committee narrowed down the EMS options under consideration to a fire-based model that would incorporate MedStar employees. If the Fort Worth City Council approves the committee’s recommendation, MedStar’s current employees would come on board as Fort Worth employees and serve as paramedics and emergency medical technicians on ambulances run by the Fire Department.
“This is going to be a great opportunity for us to work together as one team in one department,” Glynn told the Star-Telegram.
Even though the EMS workers wouldn’t serve as firefighters, their status as civil service employees would allow them to receive line-of-duty death and injury benefits, among other protections afforded to firefighters and police officers.
The Fort Worth City Council is expected to vote on adopting the ad hoc committee’s EMS recommendations and the implementation/transition plan on May 21.
MedStar has served as the sole ambulance provider for Fort Worth and the surrounding communities since 1986. Spokesperson Matt Zavadsky said MedStar will support whatever decision the council makes.
“Whatever it’s going to take to make a smooth transition and make sure that the new system is as operationally efficient, and clinically proficient as possible, we want to help facilitate that,” Zavadsky said.
Assistant City Manager Valerie Washington said the city’s goal is to make the change to fire-based EMS as easy as possible for residents.
“We’re going to do everything we can to make it a seamless process so users of the system won’t notice anything,” Washington said.
According to Washington, the transition could take up to 18 months, though she thinks that estimate is on the high end. City officials are working with Fitch and Associates, the independent consultant hired to assess Fort Worth’s EMS system, to fine tune the timeline.
A major part of the transition, according to Washington, will be the hiring and onboarding of employees to staff the ambulances.
“We would anticipate sitting down with all of the (MedStar) employees and determining, you know, which ones can move over,” Washington said. “We’re anticipating that many of them will.”
According to Zavadsky, the ambulance service currently employs around 400 paramedics and emergency medical technicians. Around 100 more employees work in dispatch and various support roles, including logistics, human resources, payroll and those who re-stock the ambulances.
It’s not clear where those who serve in support roles at MedStar would fit into the new EMS model, but Washington said some of those functions may go to other city departments outside the Fire Department.
Another part of the transition, Washington said, will be working with local hospitals and other healthcare facilities to manage their own inter-facility transports. MedStar currently provides all inter-facility transports for Fort Worth and the 13 member cities.
Officials said Tuesday that an inter-facility transfer working group will identify vendors and help coordinate the details for this portion of the transition.
“That’s definitely one of those processes that we want to make sure is solid,” Washington told the Star-Telegram.
Fort Worth is also working toward streamlining its 911 service. Currently the Fort Worth Police Department, Fire Department and MedStar each use separate communications and dispatch centers. Washington said the goal is to get all of the area’s emergency services using the same technology and eventually bring them under the same roof.
“Our goal is making sure the 911 process is as efficient as possible and making sure the end users get the fast service that they need,” Washington said at Tuesday’s meeting. “We know that time matters, and so we’re trying to find where there are minutes, seconds in the process that we could shave this down.”

Article: PALM HARBOR, Fla. - Two people were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide at a home on Moreno Drive in Palm Harbor on Tuesday morning.
The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said deputies responded to 4192 Moreno Drive just before 8:30 a.m. after a 911 call reported that a man and woman were found shot.
Stacey McLean, 52, was found dead in a bedroom inside the home when deputies arrived. Investigators also said Darryl Serraj, 26, was found dead in a separate bedroom with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Detectives said Serraj was in a romantic relationship with McLean's daughter for about five years, but it had ended recently. Serraj, according to deputies, broke into the home, murdered McLean and took his own life.
Authorities said the official cause of death will be determined by the Medical Examiner's Office.

Article: Sarnia-Lambton makes sales pitch to land EV supply chain plant
Already major players in the petroleum and chemical sectors, Lambton County hopes to be adding electric vehicle (EV) parts to its wide range of industry.
“We've been actively engaged with a variety of companies associated with the EV and EV battery supply chain,” said Matthew Slotwinsski, interim CEO of the Sarnia-Lambton Economic Partnership.
He continued, “Were really encouraged to see the progress of some of these discussions. Our hope is that the Sarnia-Lambton area is able to land one of these investments in the near future.”
Honda recently announced they will be making EVs and batteries in Alliston, Ont.
They will also need two more supply chain plants.
“They look for communities with a culture of manufacturing as they need to be able to get up and running for very tight start up production,” explained Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturer's Association.

He continued, “They need a workforce that understands advanced manufacturing, and in a place where that workforce is typically committed to a company for years rather than a lot of turnover they see in places like the U.S. southeast.”
St. Clair Township hopes to be in the mix.
“We have a lot of industrial land here in the St. Clair Township, so we're open for business,” said Jeff Agar, mayor of St. Clair Township. “We have the places and fab shops. We’re just loaded here and we have the manpower.”
After seeing nearby Windsor and St. Thomas land major factories, Slotwinski believes Sarnia-Lambton is the “place to be” for a new investment for the supply chain. He touted how well they thrive when it comes to heavy industry.

"We have large scale Greenfield heavy industrial land, with large utilities with capacities available,” said Slotwinski. “Additionally, our logistics infrastructure is fantastic. When you look at the access to roads, rail, water, and really the opportunity to present into Ontario facilities as well as those in the U.S. as well. We believe we are strategically located to see new investment.”
Volpe believes the major companies are contemplating a short list for their cathode active material and precursor processing plants.
“There's more than a few municipalities and regions that feel like they're in good stead for this including Sarnia,” said Volpe.

Article: Perhaps more than any digital audio workstation (DAW) I've tested recently, Studio One makes it easy to record audio, compose music, and mix. It's as if someone took Avid Pro Tools, removed many unnecessary mouse button presses, and rearranged the menus and dialogs to make sense. Studio One doesn't scale to larger studios as well as Pro Tools, but it's an inspired audio editing choice for anyone who needs a serious DAW and dislikes Avid's subscription pricing (though the latter may be changing, as I'll explain). While Studio One is an excellent app, our Editors' Choices for digital audio workstations are Cubase Pro for Windows and Apple Logic Pro on macOS, with Avid Pro Tools as our cross-platform pick for high-end DAWs.
How Much Does Studio One Cost?
PreSonus offers four ways to get Studio One; the downloadable free Prime version has been discontinued, but PreSonus says you can still access it by installing the 30-day trial and letting it expire. Let's start with the two Perpetual licenses: Studio One Artist ($99.99) includes unlimited audio and MIDI tracks, drag-and-drop editing and comping, track folders and event-based effects, five virtual instruments, and 28 effects plug-ins. Artist also supports adding third-party VSTs and AU plug-ins, and it works with Studio One Remote for the iPad and Android. Professional ($399.99) adds built-in Melodyne pitch correction for vocals, many more effects (including a multiband compressor and convolution reverb), and more virtual instruments. This remains the flagship DAW, and it has new features that I'll cover below.
Your other two options are subscription offerings. The Studio One+ plan gives you access to Studio One Professional, Notion notation software, additional sounds and plug-ins, cloud storage with collaboration workspaces, and a master class library of videos and live streams for $19.95 per month. PreSonus has moved many add-on plug-ins you could purchase to Studio One+, and they are no longer available for Perpetual licenses.
New for version 6.6, the Studio One Hybrid plan gives you the same lineup for $179.95 per year, plus a Perpetual license for Studio One Pro that's yours to keep. This just-launched plan is confusing because it seems to imply no one should spend $399.95 on Studio One Pro anymore if they get it for $179.95 with the Hybrid subscription, yet the Perpetual license remains on sale. When I asked about this, a PreSonus spokesperson responded, "The Perpetual license awarded at the end of the annual subscription period is non-updating. A user who does not renew their Hybrid subscription will be granted the most current version of Studio One Pro, without access to future updates," meaning you will continue to get updates if you buy the perpetual license.

Can My PC Run Studio One?
Studio One requires Windows 10 20H1 or Windows 11, macOS 10.14 or higher, 40GB of free storage for the Pro version, and at least an Intel Core i3 or AMD A10 CPU. PreSonus recommends at least 8GB of RAM and a 1,366-by-768-pixel display resolution. PreSonus is also running a public beta for a new Linux version, a welcome and rarely supported platform among major DAWs.
For this review, I tested PreSonus Studio One 6.6 on a MacBook Pro 16-inch (Late 2021, M1 Pro) running macOS Sonoma 14.4.1, a second-generation Focusrite Scarlett 6i6, a pair of PreSonus Eris E8 XT studio monitors, and a Nektar GX61 MIDI keyboard controller.
Start Page, Interface, and Instruments
A significant change for version 6 is apparent immediately: The new Start Page now contains useful Smart Templates for different kinds of projects, plus more tools for organizing your existing ones. As before, Studio One automatically suggests dates and names for your new projects to help keep you organized. Studio One Professional now supports the open-source file format DAWproject, which lets you share project files with Bitwig Studio owners. The files contain editable MIDI data, plug-in settings, and more. It remains to be seen if other DAW makers adopt the format, but anything in this direction is encouraging news.
Getting settled in Studio One is pretty straightforward if you're coming from another DAW, although it's probably a little intimidating for first-timers. Studio One has received a more modern look with dark and light themes, plus all the plug-ins have received new coats of paint. New projects open with a clean view, but by the time you're knee-deep in recording and mixing, expect a lot of visual clutter. The good news is that you can remove many elements, and a "minimal" preset lets you simplify the view considerably.
Other new features: A new Lyrics Track lets you add, edit, or move lyrics, and the latest 6.6 update improves the display on Show and Project pages. The new Global Video Track makes it easier to make quick adjustments to a video production or move around podcast pieces for final assembly.
PreSonus has always bundled a large, if uneven, sound set with Studio One. This is still the case, and Studio One hasn't added any new instruments in quite some time. The one exception is Lead Architect, an exclusive synthesizer instrument for Studio One+ that is not present in the current Professional version when you buy it. Omitting it from Professional, which has been in dire need of some new instruments, doesn't bode well for the future of the perpetual offerings taken together with the expanding subscription plan options mentioned above.
Recording and Editing With Studio One
One of the best things about Studio One is how it was conceived from the beginning to speed up typical recording and editing tasks. True to form, getting started requires fewer clicks than in some other DAWs. Click once to record, once for the metronome, and once for rewinding; double-click to split a clip into two. It's fast, and the program is super-responsive. You can set up virtual instruments so that you just have to drag the plug-ins over, complete with a picture representation. You can easily create Split and Multi instruments by dragging and dropping additional ones on the same track.
Some perennial features in other DAWs have been missing in Studio One for a while. But PreSonus is catching up, with additions such as Track Presets, which stack commonly used instruments or plug-in chains and all their settings together for call-up with a single click. Studio One now offers custom color assignments and color presets—something I wish every DAW had—along with auto-zoom during editing and more drag-and-drop editing features. You can customize the interface by adding or removing almost every tool from the various toolbars. You can even set the keyboard shortcuts to mirror Pro Tools or another DAW to ease migration to Studio One.
Most of the regular audio editing features you'd expect in a proper DAW are also here. You can trim or split clips, add fades, and adjust the gain of a clip right from the Edit window. Studio One (in Professional guise) was the first DAW to integrate genuine Melodyne pitch correction directly within the app rather than exporting audio, correcting it, and reimporting it back in as you do in Pro Tools. Since then, other popular DAWs, such as Logic and FL Studio, have added some type of integrated pitch correction. It's not only faster, but it also means you can continue to edit the pitch-corrected clips from within Studio One without having to return to Melodyne first. In version 6.6, ARA-enabled plug-ins are now available as audio editors on the Project page.
The terrific Chord Track, available only in Professional, lets you create, listen to, and change chord progressions. With it, you can quickly move around song sections and test arrangements. Chord Track also allows for harmonic editing; you can play an instrument, drag the clip to Chord Track, see what you played written out harmonically, and then add new notes to complement it. You can also drop any MIDI file into Chord Track to extract its chords and automatically create strum patterns. Studio One also supports "ripple editing," which lets you insert a section into the middle of a song; the remaining content then ripples down automatically, so you don't have to do complex cut-and-paste maneuvers. Magix Sequoia has offered this for years, and it's great to see it here. Based on PreSonus Notion, the score editor now supports tablature, lead sheets, and drum maps, making it much more useful.
In a nod to Ableton Live, MainStage, and other performance-oriented software, Studio One includes an integrated live performance environment to run and control complete shows on stage. The Show page lets you cue up backing tracks, change patches, and set up virtual and real instrument players in one window (as you can in Apple's MainStage). You can export channel strips, mixdowns, and instrument patches to the Show and arrange setlists. The program also presents real-time controls in a separate Perform view, plus more extensive metering and a virtual rack of plug-ins for effects, all of which minimize fumbling around in the dark for the right sounds before you start the next song. You can even program pauses between certain songs to talk with the audience or set it to go right into the next track.
Mixing, Dolby Atmos, and New Plug-Ins
The big news on the mixing side is Spatial Audio support, which is present from beginning to end in each project. For example, you can record in Dolby Atmos using a multichannel microphone array and mix in headphones binaurally. All relevant bundled effects plug-ins have been upgraded to support Dolby Atmos. Studio One Remote also features surround mixing and visualizations on your phone or tablet, complete with a similar 3D surround panner and multitouch support as on the desktop. Version 6.6 also adds support for Dolby Atmos composite beds.
There are some new plug-ins available as well. The new multi-tap Surround Delay can synchronize with the project tempo. DeEsser has a sharp Listen feature that can automatically find the most problematic frequency and tune itself to minimize it. The Vocoder combines two input signals and processes them with bandpass filters for glorious 1980s fun. Most importantly, two existing plug-ins received significant updates. The OpenAir2 convolution reverb sounds terrific, with plenty of lush vocal spaces you can sidechain. Pro EQ3 now offers a linear-phase low-cut, a 12th-octave spectrum display, and I/O meters with adjustable range. The latest version lets you solo individual frequency bands, and it even offers built-in dynamic equalization that would typically have you reaching for the multiband compressor or moving faders manually.
Despite its cluttered appearance, the mixer is laid out well. You can insert all kinds of effects, and PreSonus provides dozens of Extended FX chains in a separate drop-down folder that helps you mix faster. You can search for plug-ins just by typing, and you can drag inserts from one channel to another and mirror them immediately as you can in Logic. The mixer now lets you control FX/Bus sends sidechains and Cue Mix from the main faders with a right-click. Three pan modes are now available—Dual, Balance, and Binaural. The new Mixer Channel Overview page shows you all relevant settings for a given track, including its controls, inserts, sends, and cue mix, plus track icons for the first time.
You can snapshot the entire mixer for recall with Mixer Scenes, which replaces saving multiple versions of a project—although, unlike Logic Pro, Studio One lets you mix a song a bunch of different ways and recall them all instantly. One feature I've always liked in Studio One is setting up a reverb on a send; you only have to drag the reverb to the track. Studio One automatically sets up the send, the plug-in, the return, and the level so that you've got a reverb happening instantly, and you can then activate the same send on additional tracks. You can also click the send to bring up the reverb plug-in to change the release, the type, or any other parameter without first hunting up and down the mixing board for the correct channel. This is all significantly faster than it is in Pro Tools.
Using Studio One's Mix Engine FX and its Console Shaper plug-in, you can model the sound of an analog console from within the mixing engine, including drive, noise, and crosstalk. The standard compressor also sounds good on the mix bus when set to a low ratio (1.3) for just a few dB of reduction on the peaks. In the box, you get enough effects to bring a project from start to finish, including mastering (though I'll always recommend having an experienced second pair of engineers do the final mastering if the budget allows). Finally, version 6.6 adds built-in TuneCore support for distributing your finished masters across multiple digital streaming services.
Studio for All
Although Pro Tools remains the pro-studio standard, there have been some high-profile defections to Studio One. There probably should be more, given how good this program is. However, PreSonus' recent move to push the Hybrid and Studio One+ subscription plans seems to indicate that Studio One is heading in the same direction as Pro Tools when it comes to subscriptions, which will discourage some. Pro Tools still excels in importing session and individual track data, and its Smart Tool-based approach to audio editing is second to none. Unless you need Avid's support for broadcast standards and massive control surfaces or you want to have maximum compatibility with other studios and sessions, going with Studio One remains a smart alternative choice for a quality DAW. Our platform-specific Editors' Choice winners for PC and Mac DAWs are Cubase Pro and Apple Logic Pro, respectively, and Avid Pro Tools is our Editors' Choice for high-end, cross-platform DAWs.
PreSonus reinvented the common digital audio workstation with Studio One, and the latest version further hones its capabilities for working professionals.

Article: Rihanna’s been teasing R9 for so long now that nobody knows what to believe anymore. At this point, it’s anyone’s guess when or if the album is indeed coming. The most recent mention of the album came during a red carpet event for her Fenty makeup line in Los Angeles on April 28th. During this appearance, she teased R9 once again, saying "It's gonna be amazing." She also went on about how much the album would showcase her evolution as an artist.
It’s been eight long years since Riri blessed us with a body of work. During this time, however, she’s dropped a handful of singles, including the Oscar-nominated "Lift Me Up" from the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack. She has primarily focused on her fashion and beauty empire, and since it’s raking in billions, we can’t really blame her. Until definite information is put out, here's a chronological list of all the information Riri (and others) has put out about R9 since 2018.
2018: Rihanna Teases R9
The first time Rihanna stirred excitement among her fans about the release of her ninth studio album was in 2018. In an Instagram reply, she shared that fans should expect the album in 2019, sparking anticipation for new music, following her last album, ANTI, released in January 2016. The album was also rumored to be a double-disc release, with one disc featuring chart-friendly songs and the other comprising moody and experimental tracks.
2019: A Potential Reggae Release
As time passed, rumors surfaced that Rihanna’s upcoming album would involve producer Supa Dups, known for his work with Beenie Man and Sean Paul. With this information, R9 became subject to reggae and dancehall speculations. These rumors and sporadic updates continued to keep the conversation about R9 alive for a while. Moreover, twice in early 2019, Rihanna shared studio session photos on Instagram.
The first time was in January when she posted a video showing her at work in the studio. She did it again in March of the same year when she shared a photo of her best friend and project manager Jennifer Rosales' baby in the studio. Rosales would repost the baby pic on her own Instagram with this caption: “When tia @badgalriri gives you the first listen 😎. #newmusic.” No one knows whatever became of these studio visits, however.
Further along in the year, in an extensive interview with the New York Times Magazine for a cover story in May, Rihanna confirmed that she was working on a reggae sound. ANTI had featured the iconic hit “Work,” and so fans were thirsting for more. People soon speculated that the album could drop at any moment. Ultimately, this never materialized. The period coincided with her promotion of the Fenty fashion line, and amidst the album buzz, Rihanna was named by Forbes as the richest female musician in the world, and everyone forgot about R9 for a moment.
2020: “Aggressively Working On Music”
Despite the COVID-19 outbreak, some still held out hope that this would be the year Rihanna releases R9. Why? In May 2020, she graced the cover of British Vogue, and made history as the first person to wear a durag on the magazine cover. Rihanna spoke about her multifaceted career and balancing her music with her business. She then mentioned how she was "very aggressively working on music.” However, she did not disclose a release date. Like a true artist she said: "There are no rules. There’s no format. There’s just good music, and if I feel it, I’m putting it out."
2023: The Super Bowl And World Tour Rumors
In February 2023, Rihanna shared insights about her much-anticipated album R9 in an interview for her Vogue UK cover story. During the interview, Rihanna expressed her desire to release the album in 2023, saying, "I want it to be this year. Like, honestly, it’d be ridiculous if it’s not this year." She also emphasized how much fun she had to have with her music and the importance of aligning the album with her creative vision.
However, the interview took place shortly after Rihanna's performance at the Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show, and the announcement of her second pregnancy with A$AP Rocky. Evidently, there was little hope it was coming out that year. Shockingly Capital FM reported that Rihanna was "quietly planning" a huge comeback world tour for 2024 and 2025. However, despite the speculation, insiders eventually clarified that "no tour has been confirmed.”
2024: Rihanna Teases R9 Yet Again
For her Interview Magazine cover story, Rihanna explained how her creative process for R9 had “a lot of visual ideas,” but “no songs for them yet.” Again, on April 28 and 29, 2024, she made headlines with updates about her personal style and her long-awaited album. She also recently hinted that ASAP Rocky has had some hand in helping with the project's development. At a Fenty Beauty event, Rihanna shared more about her upcoming album, reiterating that it will be “amazing,” and that the delay in its release is because she wants it to truly represent her evolution. All we can do is wait.

Article: Lawyers painted two different pictures Tuesday on what happened when Jediah “JuJu” Perry was shot dead in his girlfriend’s car on 5th Avenue in Gary.
Deputy Prosecutor Tara Villarreal said in opening arguments that Rahmere Dunn killed Perry, 21, while he was buying marijuana from Dunn. Afterward, Dunn tried to delete their Facebook messages leading up to the shooting.
It was a “drug deal gone wrong,” she said.
Defense lawyer Lonnie Randolph II disagreed, saying it was self-defense. Perry tried to enlist a cousin to rob Dunn, he said. Perry held a gun to his head in the car and Dunn had no choice but to shoot him.
“It was not a drug deal gone wrong,” he told jurors. “It was a robbery that went bad.”
Dunn, now 25, of Whiting and formerly East Chicago, stands trial this week. He is charged with murder in Perry’s Nov. 12, 2021 death. He has pleaded not guilty.
Perry was shot five times in the head inside a car in front of Kelly’s Soul Food, 5025 W. 5th Ave., charges allege.
Lawrence Kelly, the restaurant’s owner, testified he called 911 around closing time after noticing the Civic had been parked outside with the lights on for “hours” — at least since 4 p.m.
Prosecutors played different segments of security footage. One part appeared to show Dunn jumping out of Perry’s white Honda Civic, running back to his Chrysler 300, then taking off.
On cross-examination, he told Randolph he didn’t hear or see the shooting.
Earlier, LaDonna Reed, Perry’s mother, said she last talked to him about a week before the shooting, telling him he should “watch people” he hung around with. A family member told her there was a shooting and she helped the coroner’s office identify her son’s body.
Police were called at 8:39 p.m. Nov. 12, 2021 where officers found Perry unresponsive inside his white Honda Civic leaning against the driver’s side window.
Security video appeared to show Perry circling the block, then pulling up next to Dunn’s Chrysler 300 at 4:53 p.m.
The man, later identified as Dunn, wore a reflective vest when he got out of the 300 and jumped inside Perry’s car.
The man in the vest went back into his car before grabbing something from his vehicle, charges state. He then went back into Perry’s car before he suddenly got out, hopped back into his car and sped off on 5th Avenue around 4:57 p.m., the affidavit states.
Police were tipped via a screenshot of Dunn’s Facebook profile that he was meeting with Perry before his death.
Investigators traced Dunn’s car via local road license plate reader systems and obtained footage that his car — with unique features like black rims and a panoramic moon roof — was in the area around the time of Perry’s murder, documents allege.
From a law enforcement database, detectives learned Dunn worked at the Lear Corp. as a forklift operator, which required him to wear a protective vest. The company said his employment ended in October 2021, documents state.
Hammond Police arrested Dunn on Nov. 30, 2021 for an unrelated crime, telling Gary Police they also found the vest in his trunk.
Cellphone records showed Dunn called Perry at 4:27 p.m. Nov. 12, 2021, just before they met, the affidavit alleges.
A search warrant for Perry’s Facebook account showed he messaged Dunn about buying marijuana just before the shooting, charges state. Dunn responded with an Apple Maps link to the soul food store as a meeting point.

Article: LIVINGSTON, La. - A 54-year-old Louisiana man will undergo physical castration in addition to 50 years in prison as part of his sentence for raping a juvenile.
Glenn Sullivan, Sr., 54, recently pleaded guilty to four counts of second degree rape, according to 21st Judicial District Attorney Scott M. Perrilloux.
The case started in July 2022 when the Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office said a young woman told detectives that Sullivan had raped her multiple times when she was 14 years old.
The victim also said, as a result, she became pregnant, and a DNA test revealed Sullivan had impregnated her.
Detectives believe Sullivan had groomed her and used threats of violence against her and her family to keep the victim from coming forward.
"So many of these types of cases go unreported because of fear," Perrilloux said in a Facebook post. "The strength it must have taken for this young woman to tell the truth in the face of threats and adversity is truly incredible," Perrilloux said."
"Sex crimes against juveniles are the most malicious crimes we prosecute," Assistant District Attorney Brad J. Cascio added. "I intend on using every tool the legislature is willing to give us, including physical castration, to seek justice for the children in our community,"
Chemical castration is the use of drugs to block hormones and decrease sexual desire. It is generally reversible by stopping the drugs. Surgical castration is a permanent procedure.
Several countries and some U.S. states — including California and Florida — allow for chemical castration for some sex offenders. Surgical castration as a punishment is much more rare.

Article: “Silvio Berlusconi was my first man. I have always found Berlusconi exceptional and fascinating. Even physically. Everyone has their own tastes, and I'm a perfectionist.” Francesca PascalBelfi's guest, in the interview with Francesca Fagnani answers a barrage of questions about her relationship with Silvio Berlusconi.
“I owe him complete gratitude, not only for the opportunity he gave me to realize my dreams. Berlusconi was the most important person. He was the best friend, the father I wanted, the perfect lover, and nothing less than a friend. He was also my teacher. I didn't feel the 49-year age difference until the end of our relationship, which had always been happily open. Obviously I was looking at his cell phone and papers…” he says with a smile.
“The dinner parties he decided to have, whether with beautiful women or not, he always went ahead with. Despite his acquaintances, he never lacked respect for me. I had no need to go elsewhere. I never hid my bisexuality from Berlusconi, and I have not yet become a lesbian… She adds: “He was always a great liberal, and he told me that he was also a bit gay… I didn't need to marry Berlusconi.” “I tried to stay close to him by trying to be myself. Was I being arrogant? I was a crazy, unbearable pain in the ass.”
Talking about starting dating. One evening Pascal receives a phone call from Berlusconi and thinks it is a joke. “I had to call him back but I didn't have money in my cell phone, I didn't have anything. I didn't even have money in my mother's cell phone… I called him for an SOS top-up… I was 20 years old.” “My parents were worried and curious too” when I started dating. “I was still going to do what I thought was right. They couldn’t stop me.”
Talking about “myths”: “It is not true that I got 20 million euros “One time,” then “a million a month… all false.” And Putin’s “mythical Latvia?” It wasn’t real Latvia, it was a painting of Putin’s master bedroom. There was no real bed. Is it disappointment? Me too…”.
to regret? “I couldn't say goodbye. If I get to see him again, I'll give him a big hug.”
“Evil zombie trailblazer. Troublemaker. Web enthusiast. Total music fan. Internet junkie. Reader. Tv guru.”

Article: West Grey 'ready to fight' to save Durham hospital amidst bed losses
Almost two months ago, the emergency department (ED) at Durham’s Community Hospital started an indefinite evening and overnight closure due to a lack of staff.
“We were guaranteed that [the emergency department] would stay as 12 hours, and doing this would solve our issues. 45 days later, ‘Oh no, we’re going to take out the beds now,’” said a frustrated West Grey Mayor Kevin Eccles.
On April 24, the South Bruce Grey Health Centre (SBGHC) said an “intensified” nursing shortage requires 10 Durham inpatient beds to be transferred to hospitals in Walkerton and Kincardine.
Durham’s ED will remain open for 12 hours a day, and diagnostic imaging and lab services will remain, but many in the Durham community fear losing their only inpatient beds means their hospital is in danger of closing.
“Tiny steps towards the end. We can see it,” said Save the Durham Hospital group member Kris Kennedy.
At a special council meeting Tuesday, West Grey council agreed to fight the bed losses and seek legal advice on how best to keep the Durham hospital open.

"The citizens here need to be serviced for our healthcare needs, not have their healthcare needs taken away from them,” said West Grey resident Christine Robinson, who was at Tuesday’s standing-room only special council meeting.
SBGHC officials say they have no plans to close Durham’s hospital, and the bed transitions slated to take place June 3 out of Durham are necessary due to chronic and worsening nursing shortages.
“Our priority is to ensure the delivery of safe and high-quality care, and we will continue to work with both the Ministry of Health and Ontario Health to ensure services are maintained across all SBGHC sites,” said SBGHC President and CEO Nancy Shaw.
SBGHC said they plan to hold town hall meetings about the Durham hospital changes in the near future.

However, the community isn’t waiting. They’re hosting a public meeting at Durham’s arena on May 7 to let everyone know that they don’t want their hospital to close.
“It’s just an important component of our community. And we don’t want to lose it, and we shouldn’t be losing it,” said Kennedy.
“The hospital needs to remain open, the beds needs to stay here, and our ER needs to be enhanced, back to 24-hour care,” said Robinson.
“We’re proud of what we have here and we’re not going to let it go,” said Eccles.
Kennedy said this is the third time over the past 60 years that Durham’s Hospital has been in danger of closing.
The last two times, community pressure and innovative solutions kept the hospital open.

Article: SOUTH COVENTRY, Penn. — A Pennsylvania priest has been accused of stealing more than $41,000 from his parish, much of which authorities allege was used to purchase and play cellphone games.
Lawrence Kozak Jr., 51, of Clifton Heights, was arrested Thursday and charged with multiple counts of theft. Prior to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia’s investigation, Kozak was a priest at St. Thomas More Church in South Coventry Township.
A criminal complaint in the case alleges that Kozak used church funds to pay for “an astronomical amount of Apple transactions” over a three-year span.
Records reviewed by law enforcement showed that Kozak used a parish credit card to pay for nearly 2,200 transactions were related to a category of spending identified as “gaming.”
The games Kozak allegedly used the money for included Candy Crush Saga, Mario Kart Tour, Pokémon Go and several slot machine games, the complaint alleges.
The Pennsylvania State Police began investigating Kozak in July 2022 after learning of financial irregularities found in St. Thomas More’s books during a routine audit.
The review determined that Kozak’s Apple ID, which allows a person to pay for purchases via his iPhone, was associated with more than $214,000 in expenses, the document alleges. About $43,000 of those charges were incurred on the parish credit card.
When questioned by police investigators, Kozak explained that both his Apple card and the parish credit card were attached to his Apple ID because of expenses related to work. When gaming, however, he said he would fail to notice when he went beyond the credit left on the Apple card, and that the charges would get “kicked over” to the parish card.
Kozak told investigators he had begun seeing a counselor to deal with his “addictive tendencies,” according to the complaint.
“Kozak expressed feelings of stupidity because he would ‘pay the bottom line’ when it came to his bills,” the document states. “(He) indicated that his father would warn him in reference to this and tell him that he has to look at what he’s paying for.
“Kozak related that he doesn’t do that and that he sees the bottom line and makes a payment.”
The priest said he was “disappointed that he let it get like this, and that there’s no excuse except that he wasn’t paying attention and should have been.”
When asked if he was aware he was improperly using the parish’s credit card, Kozak said he had no memory of ever deliberately doing so. The parish’s business manager disputed that, however, and told detectives that she’d discussed with the priest the need for him to separate his personal expenses and church expenses paid for by the parish card.
The woman also told investigators that Kozak, who opened the church’s mail, would have seen credit card statements that were eight or more pages long because of the number of transactions he had made, the complaint alleges.
In a statement obtained by WPVI in Philadelphia, archdiocese officials said that Kozak has been on administrative leave since November 2022.
“His administrative leave followed a review of Saint Thomas More Parish’s financial activity by the Archdiocesan Office for Parish Services and Support,” the statement reads. “That review resulted in certain expenses and expenditure levels utilizing parish funds being questioned.”
The Archdiocese referred the matter to law enforcement, which ultimately led to the priest’s arrest.
“The Archdiocese and the parish will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as the criminal matter enters its next phase,” church officials said. “Pending the outcome of the criminal prosecution, Father Kozak remains on administrative leave.”

Article: Golden State Warrior Draymond Green and Phoenix Sun's Jusuf Nurkić are not on the best of terms. Their altercation earlier in the season led to Draymond getting suspended for a large swath of the season. With a series sweep at the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday night, the Suns were eliminated from the playoffs. Nurkić has never made it past the first round of the playoffs in his career, so this was just another early postseason departure for him. Draymond Green, of course, jumped on the opportunity to trash the Sun's center.
Nurkić has the lowest postseason winning % in league history, with only three wins over his first 20 playoff games. Upon discovering that incredibly bad statistic, Green amused himself by making fun of Nurkić. "Hope that brother gets the help he needs," Green wrote beside a slew of frozen-faced emojis on a graphic he posted on Instagram that showed Nurkić's postseason problems. The Quote is what Nurkić said of Green after his suspension.
Draymond Green Doesn't Hold Back On Jusuf Nurkic
Despite Green's Warriors' elimination in the play-in round, he didn't hold back in taking a shot at Nurkić. Their feud is far from over and will probably be revisited next season. After falling to the Sacramento Kings in the play-in tournament, the Golden State Warriors were eliminated from the postseason. Following the defeat, Nurkic tweeted a picture of the well-known Looney Tunes phrase, "That's all, folks." Green didn't forget that tweet and had some fun with it.
The Phoenix Suns were run off the court by the Timberwolves. Where they go from here is anyone's guess. Devin Booker might be looking to move to the Big Apple. Kevin Durant is in the later stages of his career. The Golden State Warriors are in a similarly alarming situation, but at least they have Steph Curry and four rings to lean on. Overall, we can't wait to see what the next altercation between Draymond and Jusuf Nurkić looks like.

Sen. JD Vance, an Ohio Republican who is among the contenders to be Donald Trump’s vice presidential running mate, will help the former president raise money next month in Cincinnati, according to an invitation obtained Tuesday by NBC News.
Vance is billed as the "special guest" for a May 15 fundraiser and "lunch discussion" to be headlined by Trump. Host committee members are being asked to contribute or raise $250,000 per couple. For attendees, the amounts are $100,000 per couple or $50,000 per person. All funds will go to the Trump 47 joint fundraising committee.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.
The event could be a trial of sorts for Vance, a first-term senator who lives in Cincinnati and has been a top Trump ally in Ohio. Eight years ago, during his first run for president, Trump made a show of auditioning potential running mates at rallies before settling on then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.
Such public spectacles have yet to materialize in Trump’s third White House bid. The former president has been tied up in his hush money trial in New York and unable to campaign as much, though he has rallies scheduled for Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan, two Midwest battlegrounds.
Ohio is not the presidential swing state it used to be — Trump won it in 2016 and 2020 by 8 percentage points.
Trump forged a relationship with Vance, 39, after endorsing him in a crowded 2022 Senate primary. More recently, they joined forces in Ohio on behalf of former car dealer Bernie Moreno, who won the GOP Senate primary this year after the former president headlined a rally for him in the closing days of the race. Vance threw himself into the primary by courting high-level donors and helping to shore up money for the rally, which was hosted by the pro-Moreno Buckeye Values PAC.
Moreno will face Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown this fall in what is expected to be one of the most competitive Senate races in the country.
In an appearance Sunday on Fox News, Vance said he has not spoken with Trump about the vice presidency but that he would "seriously think about it" if asked to join the presumptive GOP nominee's ticket.
Vance is among several vice presidential prospects scheduled to appear this weekend at a Trump 47 spring retreat in Palm Beach, Fla. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina, Govs. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Kristi Noem of South Dakota, and Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York are also expected at the event.

Article: LOS ANGELES - According to the latest annual consumer survey by the National Retail Federation (NRF), Mother's Day spending is projected to hit $33.5 billion this year.

Article: Galena, a 6-year-old house cat from Utah, likes hiding and playing with cardboard.
Earlier this month, the combination of the two made for a stressful trip in an Amazon package, a feverish search, a California rescue and a tearful reunion.
Her family is still waiting to “reintroduce cardboard to her again," owner Carrie Clark said Tuesday, because they don't want to stress her out.
Clark got Galena as a kitten after her aunt rescued a pregnant feral cat. The American short hair with calico and Siamese coloring has been a constant companion and source of emotional support.
“I’ve been through a bunch of health things and she and I have gone through all of that together. And she’s she just has this extra great part about her personality that’s very loving. And she can tell when you don’t feel well,” Clark said. “And she's just really, really special to me.”
So when Galena disappeared on April 10, Clark was beside herself.
They searched the neighborhood, put up flyers and posted notices on Facebook lost pet pages in Lehi, Utah.
“Not knowing what had happened to her was pretty excruciating," Clark said, “I cried my eyes out for seven days trying to figure out what had happened.” Clark also ran through all the worst-case scenarios, wondering if the cat could have gotten out of the house and been nabbed by a predator or run over by a vehicle.
Clark said she received a “text that changed my life” on April 17, saying that Galena's microchip had been scanned, so Clark knew she had been found somewhere. Soon after, she got a call saying her cat was near Riverside, California, after being found in a box along with steel-toed boots that had been returned to an Amazon warehouse.
Clark's husband had ordered several pairs of boots, kept one and returned the rest in a large box on April 10.
“We realized that that our sweet kitty must have jumped into that box without us knowing,” she said.
Amazon employees knew just who to call when they found the feline — co-worker Brandy Hunter, who rescues cats, Clark said.
Hunter took the cat home and to the vet the next day, where the microchip was scanned.
Clark spoke with Hunter who “calmed me down and told me that my kitty was OK," despite having spent six days in a cardboard box without food or water.
“I wanted desperately to be with her,” Clark said. She and her husband flew to California the next day, reunited with Galena at the veterinarian's office and rented a car to drive home.
“We did what we needed to do because I just adore her,” Clark said.
It was an intensely emotional week.
“I went from hysterically laughing that she was stuck like that — we mailed our cat — you know ... just the humor part of that, to hysterically crying all within like five seconds," Clark said.
The family was lucky to get Galena back, Clark said, in part because the weather was not harsh during the time the cat was missing, the box was torn at a seam, allowing her to get more air, and because Hunter who took her to a vet and had her scanned for a microchip.
Since word got out, Clark has been sharing her cat's story, with advice to microchip your pets and to double-check your Amazon boxes before returning them.
Galena is a quiet cat, Clark said.
“She didn’t meow," Clark said. "We would have loved for her to meow so we knew that she was,” in the box.

Article: Earlier this week, Kim Kardashian took to Instagram. As is almost always the case what she delivered left people talking though it wasn't for any provocative reason this time. It had more to do with the fact that she debuted a new hair look. Sporting an otherwise all black and largely skin tight fit, her new pink hair pops out of the collection of pictures she shared. Anytime a celebrity as big as Kim K makes a fashion change it's going to be big news and her new hair color was no different.
Fans piled into her comment section sharing their thoughts on the new look. That included some fellow celebs, like Khloe Kardashian, showing love. But it also included quite a few Kanye West fans attempting to bring up the rapper's new wife Bianca Censori. "It’s giving kaynes gf if it was nude nylon" one comment reads. "I couldn't tell if this was his ex wife or his current wife" another comment agrees. Since Censori isn't particularly known for pink hair or the type of black fit Kardashian is sporting, it's hard to see when West's fans are talking about. Check out the post she shared and all the fan reactions in the comments below.
Fans React To Kim Kardashian's New Hair Color
Much of the recent discussion of Kim has surrounded Taylor Swift. The second disc of Swift's critically maligned new record The Tortured Poets Department features a diss track aimed at Kardashian. Their beef was sort of inherited from a conflict Swift already had with Kanye West.
While Kim K hasn't said much about Taylor at any point in the past few years, Swift continues to bring it up. The new song follows an award show speech last year that many claimed was directed at Kardashian. What do you think of Kim Kardashian's new pink hair color? Do you think the most recent photo dump she posted to Instagram reminds you of Bianca Censori? Let us know in the comment section below.

Article: Lyndon Joel Cosgriff-Flax, a 22-year-old Petty Officer 3rd Class in the U.S. Navy from Wichita, died during a training exercise Sunday in Virginia, authorities said.
He enlisted in August 2021.
The incident occurred shortly after 8 p.m. at the Naval Weapons Station Yorktown in Yorktown, Virginia, a spokesperson for the naval base said.
A harbor security boat team assigned to the base was “conducting security boat training, a familiarization of the York River,” the Navy said. “During this training event ... Lyndon Joel Cosgriff-Flax accidentally fell overboard resulting in fatal injuries.”
Cosgriff-Flax arrived at the base on February 2022. The Navy is investigating his death.

Article: TAMPA - At Soul de Cuba Café in Seminole Heights, brothers Jesus and Robert Puerto have food to serve and a story to tell.
"I wait for them to have the first bite of their meal, and then they get it," says Jesus.
What they get in food and photos is a uniquely Tampa story of how our food came from a melting pot of immigrant cigar workers who came from everywhere to invent eclectic Ybor City flavors.
"Instead of serving that crab enchila over rice, you serve it over pasta because you have the Sicilian influence. So you have Cuba, Tampa, Afro-Cuban, Sicilian all coming together," says Jesus.
It’s the food that cigar workers ate to sustain their bodies.
"But also their spirituality and their traditions, which were rooted in African, indigenous Cuban, and Roman Catholic traditions," says Jesus.
There’s a huge photo of the Harvest Ball on Nov. 2 1944. Segregated Black people came together at their own club in Ybor.
"It was the place where Black America and Black Cuba met," says Jesus.
He was born in Tampa, but after he suffered a near fatal case of Meningitis in 1993, Jesus went off to the Peace Corps, worked for the United Nations, Paul Newman’s charities, and opened a similar restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut. However, his dream in recent years was to return to his roots and serve his grandmother’s recipes that tell Tampa’s story.
"The story needs to be here because there are a lot of changes going on in Tampa," says Jesus.
They’re making sure that Old Tampa is remembered, from how it looked to how it tasted.
"And we’re able to tell that story one plate at a time," says Jesus.
Soul de Cuba Cafe is at 6428 N Florida Ave., in Tampa’s Seminole Heights neighborhood.

Article: BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — (AP) — When interviewed about his plans after a shock electoral victory last fall, Argentina's President-elect Javier Milei gave his go-to answer in a blink: "To exterminate inflation."
“After that ..." he trailed off, as though searching for anything else that could possibly matter. “Life,” he said, shrugging.
Driven by a single-minded obsession with slashing spending to tame inflation — now nearing 300% — the former television commentator with just two years' experience in Congress made clear from the start he had little interest in anything but economic deregulation.
But the all-or-nothing approach has left the short-tempered libertarian economist without a single legislative achievement 142 days into his presidency, raising questions about whether he can pull off his promised free-market revolution to rescue Argentina from its worst economic crisis in two decades.
Milei, who ran against "thieving politicians," has run into resistance from Argentina's combustible Congress, which he calls "the rat's nest." His proposals have been rejected by political rivals, who he calls "parasites." And he is struggling to win over disgruntled governors, who he reportedly threatened to "piss on" in a meeting last month.
But now, experts say, Milei is wising up to the game, giving up some campaign promises while maneuvering to secure enough other priorities to claim victory.
“He has had a rapid education in Machiavellian operations,” said Christopher Ecclestone, a strategist with investment bank Hallgarten & Company. “He's now using carrots and sticks to get what he wants.”
Indeed he got what he wanted Tuesday, when Argentina's lower house voted to approve a dramatically downsized version of Milei’s economic overhaul package, known as the omnibus bill. The Senate still needs to approve the legislation. Crowds of protestors converged outside Congress.
“Ending 100 years of decadence is not going to be easy but together we will break with the status quo,” Milei said in a rare message of unity after the vote.
Here's a look at the bill that got initial approval — and what it means for Argentina and its self-proclaimed “anarcho-capitalist" leader.
The first thing Milei did as president was crank out an emergency decree that allowed him to ram through hundreds of dramatic changes without Congressional oversight.
In just a few months, Milei devalued the Argentine peso by 54%, removed price controls for food and rent, froze all public works projects, halved the number of federal ministries, slashed government revenue transfers to provinces, cut fuel and transportation subsidies and laid off 15,000 state workers.
Milei claimed “a new era of prosperity” last week when Argentina logged its first quarterly fiscal surplus since 2008. He stabilized the peso's black market exchange rate after months of free-fall. Bond prices climbed.
But that's little comfort to poor and middle-class Argentines struggling to scrape by as prices rise and wages lose value. Over 40% of Argentines now live below the poverty line. Community kitchens say they're overwhelmed.
“I am forced to ask for donations because I can't afford clothes for my son,” said 37-year-old Alicia Martinez in Villa 31, an impoverished neighborhood in central Buenos Aires. “I don't know how much more I can take."
Milei may have won the run-off election with 56% vote share last November, but experts say no Argentine president has had less clout in Congress since the 1983 fall of Argentina’s military dictatorship.
“He is the weakest president in institutional terms that Argentina has ever seen,” said Ana Iparraguirre, partner at Washington-based political strategy firm GBAO.
Founded in 2021, his libertarian party, Freedom Advances, holds just 15% of seats in the lower house and 10% of the senate. None of Argentina's 23 powerful provincial governors — who hold keys to legislative support — are allies.
Milei is fighting two battles in Congress — one over his emergency decree and the other over his cornerstone omnibus bill.
Argentina's senate struck down the presidential decree last month on the grounds it was unconstitutional. The decree remains in force until the lower house rejects it. But some judges have already suspended legislative chapters deregulating the labor market following union petitions.
The omnibus bill cleared its first hurdle Tuesday. But the 232 articles that passed look radically different from Milei’s original 664-article version.
After opposition lawmakers rejected key proposals earlier this year, Milei moderated his tone and entered weeks of negotiations with mainstream right-wing and centrist parties. Ultimately, he was forced to scrap the bill's most controversial elements.
The omnibus bill remains divisive largely for granting Milei vast legislative powers in energy, tax, pensions, security and other areas.
But gone are the measures that could have bankrupted Argentina's powerful trade unions by eliminating automatic dues. Gone are the most extreme privatization plans that would have sold off Argentina's national bank and largest oil company.
In further concessions, Milei agreed he wouldn’t eliminate certain state agencies he has largely defunded, like Argentina’s national film institute and leading research body. To win over cash-strapped governors, Milei lowered salary thresholds subject to income tax.
“He presents himself as an uncompromising radical thinker but when push comes to shove, he is perfectly able to make compromises,” said Eugenia Mitchelstein, associate professor of politics at Argentina's University of San Andrés. “His 100-day honeymoon has come and gone ... He needs this law to pass.”
So far, Milei's has powered his state overhaul with little more than a whirring chainsaw.
The International Monetary Fund expects Argentina's economy to shrink by 2.8% this year. Businesses are firing. Argentines are cutting back on consumption, stoking fears of a recession.
Milei is betting foreign investment can help Argentina turn the corner. But first he needs to show investors — and show the IMF, to which Argentina owes $44 billion — “that he can govern,” said Lucas Romero, who leads the consultancy Synopsis.
Economy Minister Luis Caputo seemed to recognize that during his remarks Monday at the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange addressed to businessmen.
“Our economic recovery depends on how successful we are in convincing you,” he said.

Article: Suge Knight is a polarizing figure in hip-hop. He's the bodyguard who co-founded Death Row Records. He was the driver of the car when 2Pac got shot. He's currently behind bars for voluntary manslaughter, and won't be eligible for parole until 2034. He does, however, have opinions on the Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar beef. Knight hopped on X (formerly Twitter) to share his thoughts on Lamar's long-awaited diss record, "Euphoria." His response was predictable in some ways, yet surprising in others.
For starters, Knight came out as pro K. Dot. Not one single hip-hop fan in surprised to hear this. "Round one goes to Kendrick Lamar," he tweeted. It was the rest of the post that caught fans off guard. Knight, a notoriously violent criminal, decided to use the Drake vs. Lamar beef as a platform to condemn colorism and violence within the Black community.
Suge Knight Condemned The Colorism In K. Dot's Diss
This was sparked, presumably, by the ongoing mockery of Drake for being light-skinned, and therefore not as authentic as Lamar. "Youngin let’s stop saying light skinned people aren’t black," Knight asserted. "Cause the police think otherwise. Black is Black. That creates division amongst ourselves, and I ain’t f**kin with that." Some X users commended Knight for speaking out on the topic, but others criticized him for being a hypocrite given his past indiscretions. Then there those who simply wanted to know why Knight had access to X.
Those who have been plugged into the Drake vs Lamar beef know, however, that Suge Knight has been giving his opinion the whole time. He was extremely critical of Drake for using an AI-generated 2Pac on the diss record "Taylor Made Freestyle." He even dedicated a segment to it on his podcast Collect Calls. "Putting him on a song and dissing Kendrick for everybody entertainment-- that ain’t how it go," Knight asserted. "Then putting him on a song with Snoop, who was a part of his downfall and exit, ain’t ever a good look. He never was a pawn."
Do you agree with Suge Knight's take? Is Kendrick up 1-0?

Article: An informant, police tracking of vehicles and an undercover officer helped lead to five people who are now charged with copper wire theft from St. Paul streetlights with an estimated repair cost to the city of more than $200,000, according to recently filed criminal complaints.
In another case charged Friday, St. Paul police discovered 45 damaged streetlights with an estimated repair cost of $225,000.
St. Paul spent $1.2 million last year on repair and replacement due to wire theft and accompanying damage to streetlights and traffic signals, compared with $250,000 in 2019, according to the city. Electric car chargers, window air-conditioning systems and other infrastructure has also been targeted.
The Ramsey County attorney’s office made accusations against six St. Paul residents in charges filed Friday. The criminal complaints give the following information from prosecutors:
Police received information in January from an informant that Kyaw Klay, 40, organized a crew who went out and damaged streetlights, removing wire from them. An attorney for Kyaw Klay couldn’t be reached Tuesday.
Kyaw Klay and Paw Hkee La, 21, then sold the wire to recycling facilities, including Dem-Con Metal Recycling in Blaine, the informant said.
Dem-Con paid about $3 per pound for copper wiring that had been removed from its insulation and $2 per pound for such wiring that was stamped with “City of St. Paul Public Works” on its insulation.
Dem-Con Metal Recycling is part of the scrap alert network “and we take it very seriously,” said Erik Schuck, the company’s chief operating officer, on Tuesday. “In particular, we were working with the authorities … on this and we are glad to see that these individuals have been apprehended.”
Officers conducted surveillance and saw Kyaw Klay and two others went to Dem-Con on Feb. 5 and sold 127 pounds of copper for $387.
“Kyaw Klay was so familiar to employees at Dem-Con that they no longer asked him for his identification when he brought copper in to sell to them,” the complaint said. State law specifies that scrap metal dealers must make a record of every purchase of scrap metal, which includes getting a copy of the seller’s ID.
Schuck said he couldn’t comment on specific allegations in the complaint.
Kyaw Klay completed 31 transactions with Dem-Con between Nov. 10 and Jan. 15, receiving $12,169 in total.
Undercover officer, vehicle tracking
An undercover officer made arrangements for Kyaw Klay to sell “stolen” copper wire to Dem-Con on his behalf, with the officer telling the man he would get half the money from the sale. The officer was provided with copper wire from the department’s property room that had “City of St. Paul Public Works” stamped on its insulation.
The officer went with Kyaw Klay and Paw La on Feb. 7 to Dem-Con. An employee accepted stripped copper wires that Kyaw Klay brought and the undercover officer’s wire marked with “City of St. Paul,” and Kyaw Klay wasn’t asked to show his ID.
The informant previously told police that Kyaw Klay collected the stolen wire in a Toyota Camry and police obtained a warrant to put a tracking device on the car. On Feb. 16 about 12:45 a.m., officers tracked the car to the area of Mississippi River Boulevard and Dayton Avenue.
Officers on surveillance saw several people cutting wire from streetlights on the Marshall Avenue-Lake Street Bridge and later from streetlights near Marshall Avenue and Mississippi River Boulevard. About 25 streetlights were found damaged, with wires cut and removed, in the area of the Marshall Avenue-Lake Street Bridge. The estimate to repair them is about $125,000.
Police stopped the Toyota Camry and identified Kyaw Klay as the driver and Paw La as the front seat passenger. Eh Tha Blay, 25, and Aye Mae, 42, were the backseat passengers.
Police obtained another tracker warrant for a different Toyota Camry. Officers saw that car parked near the Highland Aquatic Center at 12:20 a.m. Feb. 23 and found 17 damaged streetlights around the pool with the wire cut from them. It’s an estimated $85,000 to repair those lights.
Police pulled over the Camry, and identified the driver as Nay Thar, 36, and the passenger as Eh Blay.
There was cut copper wire at Eh Blay’s feet. Police arrested the pair and Eh Blay told investigators he makes money by following friends who pull copper wire from light poles. He said no one in the car stole wire that night and he had tools because he fixes vehicles.
The Ramsey County attorney’s office charged Eh Blay, Kyaw Klay, Paw La, Aye Mae and Nay Thar on Friday with aiding and abetting energy or telecom damage, first-degree criminal damage to property and possession of burglary or theft tools.
Warner Road lights
Also charged Friday with the same offenses was Gay Gay, 44. Officers conducting surveillance on Feb. 23 saw Gay Gay walking by the Mississippi River, carrying a large bag and stopping near inoperable streetlights, according to the complaint against him.
Police found him parked in Lower Landing Park on Warner Road at 2:25 a.m. There was a large amount of cut copper wire in the vehicle, the complaint said.
Investigators found more than 45 streetlights along Warner Road had fresh damage and copper wire stripped from them. It’s an estimated $225,000 to repair them.
Five of the six people, with the exception of Aye Mae, have been charged with similar offenses this year.
Two St. Paul legislators are sponsoring bills that would require anyone selling copper metal to have a state-issued license. Construction contractors, people who work in residential trades and other licensed workers would continue to be allowed to sell copper and wouldn’t need a separate license. The bills would still allow residents and businesses to recycle copper materials with scrap metal companies for free.

Article: Throughout her breakthrough across the past few years, sex appeal has always been a part of GloRilla's music. She's no stranger to showing off her good looks in memorable outfits and has become an expert at flexing sensual dance moves in her music videos. That was the case once again with her most recent single "Wanna Be" which features Megan Thee Stallion. The sensual video attached to the song features Megan and Glo throwing their own version of a frat party.
Even though sex appeal has always been part of GloRilla's creative output, she recently made a post speaking out against the very concept. "Mfs luv talking about sex appeal baby f*ck da sex appeal I got DA SEX dats what's gone get ya n*gga took in real life, PUSSY GOOD CHECK ion gotta do allat extra shit Fym you hoes be sexy ash with no walls coochie dry asf f*ck outta here," her profanity-laced tweet reads. Despite her all over the place point, many fans in the replies completely agree with what she's saying. Check out the post and some of the reactions to it below.
GloRilla Fires Off About Sex Appeal
GloRilla is fresh off the release of her new mixtape Ehhthang Ehhthang earlier this month. The project sports the previously mentioned Megan Thee Stallion collaboration alongside appearances from Moneybagg Yo, Kevo Muney, Boston Richey, and Finesse2Tymes. It's her first new project since the Anyways.. Life's Great EP dropped in late 2022.
Earlier this year, GloRilla appeared a few times on the Gangsta Art 2 compilation album for her label CMG. She handles the opening track all by herself and later hops on the posse cut "Wrong One." The track that got the most attention was "Cha Cha Cha" with Fivio Foreign, though for the most part it wasn't exactly positive attention. What do you think of GloRilla;s rant against sex appeal and in favor of having receipts? Do you agree with her take that sex appeal isn't everything? Let us know in the comment section below.

Article: HARARE, Zimbabwe — (AP) — Out with the Zimbabwe dollar, in with the ZiG.
Zimbabwe on Tuesday started circulating a new currency to replace one that has been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people. The ZiG was introduced electronically in early April, but people are now able to use banknotes and coins.
It's the southern African country's latest attempt to halt a long-running currency crisis underlining its persistent economic troubles. The government had previously floated various ideas to replace the Zimbabwe dollar, including introducing gold coins to stem inflation and even trying out a digital currency.
Since it was launched electronically on April 5, the ZiG — short for Zimbabwe Gold and backed by the country's gold reserves — appears to be heading down the same path of mistrust, with some government departments refusing to accept it.
The ZiG is the sixth currency Zimbabwe has used since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the world's worst currency crashes to date. That set off a chaotic series of events: first the U.S. dollar was allowed as legal tender, then banned, then unbanned.
A new “bond note” became legal tender, the Zimbabwe dollar was reintroduced before the gold coins and digital currency were tried.
However, nothing brought any currency stability and the U.S. dollar remains the most trusted for ordinary Zimbabweans.
As the shiny new ZiG banknotes hit the streets, the mistrust was evident.
Kudzanayi Mande, a vegetable trader at the crowded Mbare market in the capital of Harare, said she would rather forgo a sale than accept the ZiG. She was confused, the 56-year-old said.
“Already there is an official exchange rate and a depreciated black market rate, so I will wait a bit to see what its real value is,” she said. "The U.S. dollar is still a safer bet.”
The government has allowed some businesses, such as gas stations, to refuse to accept the ZiG in favor of U.S. dollars. Some departments, like the office that issues and renews passports, accept only U.S. dollars.
At the same time, other businesses are being ordered to only use the ZiG, and face punishment if they don't.
“The government prints the money so it should be the first to accept the currency and everyone else will follow," said Gift Mugano, an economics professor at South Africa’s Durban University of Technology.
“Otherwise it is behaving like someone who feeds on takeaways but wants others to eat the food they cook,” Mugano said. "It becomes suspicious.”
Many in Zimbabwe still remember when a 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollar banknote was printed in 2009 at the height of the hyperinflation to keep up with spiraling prices.
At one point, a loaf of bread cost more than 500 million Zimbabwe dollars. Prices would change from when customers walked into a grocery store to when they lined up to pay at the cash register. Restaurants stopped displaying prices on menus as they would go up over the course of a dinner. People lugged around bags stuffed with banknotes. Savings and pensions became worthless.
Through the ordeals, the greenback remained precious — and highly valued on the black market.
Across Zimbabwe, the U.S. dollar is still widely used, from paying rent and school fees to buying groceries. Many take their local currency earnings to the black market to exchange for dollars since banks don't give out U.S. dollars. Some people stash their U.S. dollars at home.
The government of President Emmerson Mnangagwa has taken a hard-line approach — dozens of black market currency dealers were arrested and have been in pretrial detention for weeks, accused of trying to undermine the new currency. After the ZiG was introduced electronically, bank accounts of some businesses were frozen, accused by the government of rejecting the new currency.
Authorities say they have faith in the ZiG because it's backed by the country's gold reserves. Mnangagwa said in a speech on Monday it was a matter of "our national identity and dignity" to trust the ZiG.
Though some hopeful Zimbabweans headed for the banks Tuesday to get their hands on the new currency, many remained skeptical after two decades of turmoil.
An online news outlet published a political cartoon showing a policeman struggling to hold up a collapsing house with the word ZiG on it.
The caption: “World’s first police backed currency.”

Article: WASHINGTON – Downtown hotels will be hard to come by when the Republican National Convention kicks off in Milwaukee in just over two months.
But members of Wisconsin's convention delegation have secured their rooms.
The state's delegation will stay at the Hampton Inn & Suites just half a mile from Fiserv Forum, the epicenter of the July 15-18 convention, after originally being slated to stay at a hotel in Racine, a Republican Party of Wisconsin spokesman told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel this week.
Exactly why the delegation was moved from Racine to the downtown Milwaukee hotel was not entirely clear, though one GOP official told the Journal Sentinel Tuesday the change was made during a back and forth between the Wisconsin delegation and the RNC.
A spokeswoman for the convention Tuesday night said the delegation "significantly reduced their hotel room needs" and dropped additional event space requests, allowing them to stay in Milwaukee. The delegation includes both convention delegates and members of Wisconsin's members of Congress.
The downtown hotel has faced financial trouble in recent years. The Hampton Inn & Suites closed temporarily last May but reopened under new owners — the fourth operators in just over four years.
The Hampton Inn & Suites is just one of many around Milwaukee and southeastern Wisconsin the convention will put to use. Organizers have contracted with 111 hotels in Wisconsin for the RNC, officials told the Journal Sentinel.
Organizers try to keep the members of each state delegation together in a hotel or in neighboring hotels for reasons including the ease of transportation and camaraderie, but figuring out who goes where can be complicated. Some of it has to do with politics.
"Who are good supporters? Who is doing good work in their states? Who are the good actors? Who is working hard? Who is meeting certain deliverables and benchmarks in their states?" Elise Dickens, the chief executive officer for the Republican National Committee, said in March.
Other hotel assignments have not been publicly released.

Article: Hearing aids are a lifeline for people with some degree of hearing loss. Once you know it's -- or invest in your very first pair -- one thing you may notice is how delicate (and sometimes ) hearing aids are. If you think your hearing aids are beyond help, we've gathered some of the most trusted brands below to help you find your next pair. And when you're ready to clean them, we're here to help you get started there, too.
Since the technology for hearing aids is complicated, it matters which tools and cleaning solutions you use. The buildup of earwax or moisture can damage your hearing aid over time, leading to telltale signs of damage like fading, choppy or distorted sound.
Your hearing aids can also cause a buildup of ear canal debris such as bacteria or excess wax, which can lead to health concerns like irritation or even infection.
For these reasons, it's important to clean your hearing aids regularly -- and to make sure you're occasionally visiting a licensed audiologist or hearing specialist for a professional scrubbing. See our guide below for proper hearing aid cleaning tips and tools.
How to clean your hearing aids
If you want your hearing aids to last, it's important to clean them regularly. Many devices come with a hearing-aid cleaning kit and manufacturer recommendations with tips on how to safely and efficiently clean your hearing aid. Refer to these instructions first to avoid any unnecessary damage or a void on your warranty. Most manufacturer warranties, like the one offered by MDHearing, do not cover damage from excess moisture.
You may be tempted to use water or a damp cloth to clean your hearing aid, but we recommend sticking with cleaning solutions and tools that are approved for use with hearing aids. This is due to the delicate nature of these devices and the technology within them.
Want to keep your hearing aid clean and in tip-top shape? Disinfect and wipe away wax or debris buildup with a microfiber cloth on a nightly basis. We also recommend routinely storing your hearing aid in a dehumidifier overnight to easily prevent moisture buildup.
We also recommend giving hearing aids a more thorough cleaning once per week. Professional cleanings from a licensed hearing aid professional can also make daily upkeep easier, plus it gives you an opportunity to discuss any issues or adjustments. Schedule a professional cleaning once every six months.
What are the best tools for cleaning hearing aids?
If you don't already have a dedicated cleaning kit for your hearing aid, we've got you covered. There are tools you can buy on your own -- separately or as part of a hearing aid cleaning kit -- to keep your devices in good shape.
Some common tools that will get the job done for most, if not all, types of
include:- Hearing aid brush: Commonly found in cleaning kits, this brush is good for cleaning the surface of hearing aids to remove any wax, dirt, or debris.
- Slim tube cleaning tool: Not unlike pipe cleaners, these tools are meant to clean and dust the inside from the tubing of hearing aids. For smaller devices, there are small-scale NanoClean cleaners that can get the job done for tiny tubing.
- Disinfectant spray: These products typically contain ingredients that break down wax buildup. Double check with manufacturer recommendations before buying to make sure a spray solution is safe for your hearing aid.
- Wax loops: These tools can be used to clean earwax from the earpiece that sits in the ear canal, which can block sound transmission over time.
- Microfiber cloth: This type of cloth is best for wiping down everything after cleaning to remove any remaining wax, dust, or debris.
- Dryers and dehumidifiers: There are a variety of drying devices you can buy that are meant to keep hearing aids safe from moisture buildup. Some dryers are fully automatic and use UV lights for a quick clean, such as the effective Kapak disinfection dryer.
How to clean different types of hearing aids
You may be wondering if there is anything specific you should be doing for your hearing aid based on the
you have. There are a variety of hearing aid types out there that range from tiny, discreet devices that sit in your ear (similar to a pair of wireless earbuds) to bulkier hearing aids that house all the important tech in a plastic case that wraps around the ear.Let's break it down into two categories: in-the-ear hearing aids (ITE) and behind-the-ear hearing aids (BTE). Most hearing aids generally fall into one category or the other. Here are some cleaning tips for either type.
ITE hearing aids are fairly straightforward: Use a hearing-aid brush to wipe down the outer portion, move on to a wax loop tool to finish off any stubborn wax buildup, then finish up with a slim tube cleaning tool. Carefully thread it through any and all ventilation tubing. Don't forget to give your device a once-over with a microfiber cloth afterwards. Store your hearing aid in its original case or a dehumidifier overnight as well.
BTE hearing aids can be a bit more involved when it comes to proper cleaning and maintenance. You should still start with a brush for the exterior of the receiver and microphone cover devices, followed by the wax loop. Make sure to brush any additional microphones, which may be located on the back of the hearing aid, as well. If your hearing aid has an ear mold, refer to manufacturer instructions for cleaning it: this will likely include a brief soak in warm, soapy water. Make sure the mold is completely dry before reassembling and using (or storing) the device.
Can I use alcohol wipes on hearing aids?
While it may be tempting to use basic household cleaners like alcohol wipes to clean and disinfect your hearing aid, we recommend against this. Abrasive chemicals that contain ammonia or bleach may damage the plastic casing, which is typically fragile. The tech inside your hearing aid is also very vulnerable to moisture, which can seep into the tiny devices from a damp alcohol wipe, cloth, or an ill-advised spray from a chemical cleaner.

Article: LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers staved off elimination with a must-needed Game 5 victory, but one moment in particular during the game is sparking conversation among NBA fans.
It was business as usual for LeBron James, who helped his Lakers avoid the embarrassment of being swept and blowing another double-digit lead. James led his team with 30 points, five rebounds, four assists, three steals, and one block.
James put on a show in the fourth quarter, scoring 14 points, but it wasn’t without a spectacle. A moment between the 20-time All-Star and his coaching staff caught the attention of viewers watching the game.
During a possession in the 4th quarter with 9:10 remaining, the Denver Nuggets were given possession after it appeared that James poked the ball out of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope’s hands. Replays would show that was not the case, with James urging his head coach, Darvin Ham, to challenge the call, regain possession and build on their double-digit lead.
When that didn’t happen, James jumped up and down in frustration with Coach Ham and his staff, screaming, “Challenge the f*cking play!.” To make matters worse, Jamal Murray scored on a layup, taking advantage of the Lakers’ lack of focus.
Luckily for the purple and gold, that play was not a momentum shifter, and the Lakers protected their lead, something they had failed to do in the previous three games.
Was LeBron Overreacting, or Did Darvin Ham Drop The Ball Coaching Wise?
Reactions to the moment range from Lakers fans siding with James and questioning Darvin Ham’s coaching abilities to others using the moment to call King James a crybaby.
“If Ham is still apart of our organization next season I might stop watching basketball I’m so serious,” one user on X, formerly Twitter wrote.
Another NBA fan wrote, “Lebron is hilarious. 4 rings in 25 years is not a Goat. Goats dont have tantrums either. Lebron doesn’t know that his time has passed and is gone. Retire.”
Regardless, the Lakers will live to fight another day. The gallery below shows more reactions to the moment.

Article: Auftakterfolg für Seubelsdorfer U12 bei der Bayerischen Mannschaftsmeisterschaft der Jugend
Feuerprobe in der Königsklasse
Für Jugendschach ist die Bayerische Mannschaftsmeisterschaft eine Feuerprobe in der Königsklasse. Im Pyramidensystem spielen jeweils vier Teams gegeneinander, von denen nur die zwei besten weiterkommen. Am 27. April begrüßte die U12 des Schachverein Seubelsdorf zum Auftakt den VfB Einberg, den SK Schweinfurt und den SC Erlangen im heimischen Vereinsheim des TV Oberwallenstadt. Jonathan Hewera, Moritz Fiedler, Julian Schmuck und Jan Hoffmann hatten unter Matthias Bergmann hart geübt, doch wirkte der Aufmarsch von Talenten mit teilweise deutlich höheren Wertungszahlen beeindruckend.
In der ersten Runde forderten die Schweinfurter den Gastgeber stark heraus. Hewera spielte geistreich auf Matt und Materialgewinn, verlor jedoch durch ein Übersehen die Qualität und musste nach langer Gegenwehr aufgeben. Schmucks Gegner kannte das Schlagen „en passant“ nicht und verschaffte Schmuck so einen Freibauern. Schmuck konnte ihn aber nicht halten und kam im Bauernendspiel sogar noch unter die Räder.
Trotz 0:2‑Rückstand retteten Fiedler und Hoffmann einen Mannschaftspunkt: Fiedler knöpfte seinem Kontrahenten immer mehr Figuren ab und kam zu einem sicheren Sieg. Hoffmanns beherzter Mattangriff sah sich schon nach wenigen Zügen vom Erfolg gekrönt.
Danach ging es in der zweiten Runde gegen Einberg schon um Alles oder Nichts. Durch druckvolles Spiel verwirrte Hewera seinen Gegner so, dass dieser zwei unmögliche Züge machte und dafür, in bereits verlorener Stellung, „genullt“ wurde. Schmuck ließ es nach einem Figurengewinn ruhig angehen, schlug jedoch blitzschnell zu, als sein Gegner die eigene Königsstellung schwächte, und setzte mit schwungvollem Läuferopfer Matt. Gegenläufig dazu büßte Fiedler zuerst Material ein, fand aber durch taktische Stiche ins Spiel zurück und konnte ebenfalls den gegnerischen König zur Strecke bringen. Hewera besiegelte in überlegener Stellung Unentschieden, um etwas Kraft zu sparen.
Denn in der dritten und letzten Runde wartete der härteste Gegner auf die Seubelsdorfer: Der SC Erlangen hatte die ersten beiden Durchgänge mit 3:1 gewonnen und lag im Schnitt 200 Wertungspunkte über den Gastgebern.
Hewera maß sich an Brett 1 sogar mit einem 300 Punkte stärkeren „Schwergewicht“, brachte seinen Kontrahenten durch eine ausgefallene Eröffnung aber gehörig ins Schwitzen. Zwischendurch hatte Hewera sogar einen Mehrbauern und das freiere Spiel. Nach Ungenauigkeiten übersah er allerdings, dass ein feindlicher Turm inzwischen entfesselt war und ihn jäh mattsetzen konnte.
Auch an Brett 2 hieß es zunächst „Vorteil für Seubelsdorf“, da Fiedler einen Bauern gewonnen hatte. Indessen unterschätzte er einen gegnerischen Läufer, der nicht nur den Bauern zurückgewann, sondern sich auch noch einen ganzen Turm schnappte, was die Partie aussichtslos machte.
An Brett 3 zeigte Schmuck hervorragendes Eröffnungsverständnis, das ihm dabei half, ein erzieltes materielles Übergewicht auch sicher zu verwerten. Nun hing alles an der wechselhaften Partie von Hoffmann an Brett 3: Bald eine Figur im Rückstand, hielt er dem Druck stand und fing seinerseits einen verirrten Springer ein, ja erreichte sogar ein vorteilhaftes Turmendspiel. Der erfahrene Gegner rettete sich nach einigen Abenteuern dann doch in ein Unentschieden. Die nominell überragenden Erlanger setzten sich also mit 1,5:2,5 denkbar knapp durch, was das enorme Potenzial der „jungen Wilden“ von Seubelsdorf zeigt.
Ihr Einsatz lohnte sich zudem nicht nur moralisch, sondern auch sportlich: Mit einem Brettpunkt Vorsprung vor Schweinfurt kamen sie auf den zweiten Platz dieses Umgangs und qualifizierten sich damit für die nächsten drei Runden im Mai.
Grobes Lob aller Beteiligten galt den Helferinnen und Helfern, die das Match bestens bewirteten und für den den immer wieder nötigen Beistand sorgten.

Article: Bamberg Baskets liefern sich mit den Telekom Baskets Bonn über drei Viertel ein spannendes Kräftemessen und musste sich am Ende doch knapp geschlagen geben
Mit den Telekom Baskets Bonn kamen am Dienstagabend der aktuelle Tabellensechste nach Bamberg. Ein Sieg für seine Bonner gehörte für den Bonner HeadCoach Roel Moors eigentlich „zum Pflichtprogramm“; ganz so einfach wurde es aber dann doch nicht.
Die Bamberger erwischten zu Beginn des ersten Viertels zwar den besseren Start, sahen sich aber schnell dem Bollwerk des Tabellensechsten ausgesetzt; der den Turbo anwarf. Kein Wunder also, dass der hauchdünne, erarbeitete „Sechs-Punkte-Vorsprung“ für Bamberg so langsam vor sich hinschmolz. Bonn drehte das Spiel und konnte die Führung zum Ende des ersten Viertels auf 19:25 ausbauen. Auf Bamberger Seite machte im ersten Viertel besonders Justin Gray von sich machen, der sechs Punkte zum aktuellen Spielstand beitrug. Für die Bonner erzielte deren Top-Performer Brian Fobbs, der durchschnittlich bisher 14,2 Punkte pro Spiel erzielte, fünf Punkte bei. So richtig konnte der Bonner HeadCoach Roel Moors bisher mit der Leistung seiner Mannschaft nicht zufrieden sein, wäre da doch bisher mehr drin gewesen. Nach gespielten vier Minuten im zweiten Viertel stand es 26:33 für Bonn. Bambergs Trainer Arne Woltmann holte seine Jungs zu sich nach außen, drohte doch zu diesem Zeitpunkt eine übermächtige Bonner Mannschaft die Führung noch deutlicher auszubauen.
Die Fans der Bamberg Baskets merkten, dass ihre Mannschaft nun die Unterstützung von den Rängen brauchen und peitschten ihre Jungs zu einer Aufholjagd nach vorne. Bamberg wurde stärker.und so konnten die Hausherren den Bonner-Vorsprung „wettmachen“ und erkämpften sich ein zu diesem Zeitpunkt hochverdientes 41:41. Eine Führung gelang den Bambergern zu diesem Zeitpunkt aber noch nicht. Mit einem knappen Vorsprung von 41:46 für die Gäste aus Bonn ging es dann – nach einem spannenden zweiten Viertel – in die Halbzeitpause. Für die drei Unparteiischen, die zum Ende des zweiten Viertels mit einigen fragwürdigen Entscheidungen negativ in den Fokus der Bamberger Fans rückten, gab es ein lautstarkes Pfeifkonzert von den Rängen. Trey Woodbury zählte zu diesem Zeitpunkt zu den Top-Werfern. Er holte zehn der 41 Punkte; dicht gefolgt von Malik Johnson, der acht Punkte erzielte.
Lassen sich die Bamberger das Spiel jetzt aus der Hand nehmen? Die Telekom Baskets kommen frischer aus der Halbzeitpause. Nach gespielten zwei Minuten nach Wiederanpfiff zeigte die Anzeigentafel 43:51 für Bonn. Drei Minuten nach Wiederanpfiff – beim Stand von 45:56 – holte Arne Woltmann seine Jungs abernals zu sich nach draußen, drohte doch, dass der Bonner Vorsprung weiter ausgebaut werden könnte. Aber genau das Gegenteil war der Fall. Bamberg zeigte mehr „Biss“ und „Kampfgeist“ und „schraubte sich Punkt für Punkt an den Gegner heran. 59:61 stand es eineinhalb Minuten vor Ende des dritten Viertels. Es entwickelte sich ein offner Schlagabtausch zwischen beiden Mannschaften, welcher an Spannung nicht zu überwieten war. Mit 62:65 ging es dann in das letzte Viertel. Top-Scorer nach gespielten drei Vierteln auf Bamberger Seite waren Malik Johnson (10) und Trey Woodbury (10).
Wer glaubte: „Mehr Spannung geht nicht; der irrte“. Nach gespielten dreieinhalb Minuten im Schlussviertel stand es 68:70. Die 4066 Besucher sahen ein auf und ab. Bamberg lief immer zu diesem Zeitpunkt immer noch dem Rückstand hinterher. 72:73 stand es nach noch zu spielenden fünf Minuten. 4:55 waren noch zu spielen als Bamberg unter großem Jubel der Fans zum 73:73 ausglich. Geht da noch was für Bamberg? 73:78 rund vier Minuten vor dem Ertönen der Schlusssirene. 75:79 zwei Minuten vor Schluss. „Auf geht‚s Bamberg kämpfen und siegen“; schallte es zum x‑ten Mal durch die Brosearena. Trey Woodbury machte es nochmals spannend als er mit einem Dreier zum 79:81 einnetzte. Am Ende reichte es für Bamberg nicht. Sie mussten sich nach einer kampfbetonten und spannenden Partie knapp mit 79:89 geschlagen geben.
Für Bamberg trafen:
Justin Gray (8), Herzog Lukas (3), Zach Copeland (8), Malik Johnson (13), Adrian Nelson (10), Karsten Tadda (5), Trey Woodbury (13), Patrick Heckmann (4), EJ Onu (5), Filip Stanic (10)

Article: Bayreuther Wissenschaftler arbeiten am sicheren Datenaustausch für die Energiewende
Gemeinsam mit Partnern haben Bayreuther Wirtschaftsinformatiker für die Deutsche Energieagentur (dena) einen sicheren Weg des Datenaustauschs im Energiesystem erarbeitet. Am 25.4. wurde der Bericht „Grundlagen und Bedeutung von Datenräumen für die Energiewirtschaft“ veröffentlicht. Autoren sind Prof. Dr. Jens Strüker und Dr. Marc-Fabian Körner von der Universität Bayreuth.
What for?
Das erklärte Ziel der Dekarbonisierung der Stromversorgung kann nur erreicht werden, indem mehr regenerative Energien dezentral eingespeist werden. Damit werden bisherige Wege der Kraftwerkseinsatzplanung (der sogenannte (Re-)Dispatch, der ausgleicht, wer wann wie viel Strom liefert) nicht mehr ausreichen. Und diese Herausforderung wird größer, je größer die Zahl von einspeisenden Kleinsterzeugungsanlagen wie PV-Anlagen oder Heimspeichern wird. Ein verbesserter Datenaustausch im Energiesystem erzeugt erhebliche Effizienzgewinne und sorgt dafür, dass im System insgesamt weniger Energie gebraucht bzw. weniger Ausgleich von großen Stromschwankungen im Netz notwendig wird. Weil der Netzausgleich heute vor allem von fossilen Kraftwerken geleistet wird, senkt der erhöhte Datenaustausch durch die verbesserte Koordination unmittelbar Treibhausgasemissionen. Daher ist die Arbeit an einem effizienten, sicheren Datenraum zum Datenaustausch vieler Anbieter und Verbraucher ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Energiewende.
Um die notwendigen Strukturen für einen effizienten und sicheren Datenaustausch zwischen allen Partnern im Stromsystem zu erproben, wurde im Projekt dena-ENDA (ENergy DAta Space) eine Referenzarchitektur für einen Energiedatenraum entwickelt und umgesetzt. Das heißt, es wurde ein sicherer virtueller Raum geschaffen, in dem alle Beteiligten an einem dezentralen Stromversorgungsnetz Daten austauschen können, um so Stromschwankungen, Nachfrage- und Erzeugungsanpassungen, den Re-/Dispatch, abzufedern. Das ist nötig, um die Versorgungssicherheit auch mit sich verändernden Rahmenbedingungen zu gewährleisten.
Das Future Energy Lab, das Pilotierungs- und Vernetzungslabor für Digitale Technologien der Deutschen Energie-Agentur (dena), hat in Kooperation mit der ifok GmbH, Bonn Consulting, Fraunhofer FIT und innogence business consulting ein Projekt zur Etablierung von Datenräumen in der Energiewirtschaft umgesetzt. In Zusammenarbeit mit den verschiedenen Akteuren, z.B. Verteilnetzbetreibern, Anlagenbetreibern oder Servicedienstleistern wurden technische Fragestellungen geklärt und eine Datenraum-Architektur entwickelt. Prof. Dr. Jens Strüker, Professor für Wirtschaftsinformatik und Digitales Energiemanagement, und Dr. Marc-Fabian Körner, Postdoc Wirtschaftsinformatik, beide an der Universität Bayreuth und für das FIT tätig, haben das Projekt wissenschaftlich begleitet und den Bericht verfasst.
„Die Energiekrise hat schmerzlich den Mangel an digitalem Datenaustausch in der Energiewirtschaft aufgezeigt: Staatliche Unterstützung konnte nicht zielgenau erfolgen, da Energieverbrauchsdaten ebenso fehlten wie eine durchgängige digitale Kommunikation zwischen Haushalten, Unternehmen auf der Verbraucherseite und Energieversorgern auf der anderen Seite“, berichtet Strüker. „Für den Energiesektor würde ein verbesserter Datenaustausch bedeuten, dass Daten diverser Energieerzeugungs- und Energieverbrauchseinheiten unterschiedlicher Größe unter definierten Richtlinien miteinander geteilt, ausgetauscht und weiterverarbeitet werden können.“ Mit dem nun bekannt gemachten Pilotprojekt wurde erstmals ein solcher Datenraum im deutschen Energiesektor eingerichtet.
Strüker erläutert: „Allgemein ermöglichen Datenräume den souveränen und selbstbestimmten Austausch von Daten über Unternehmensgrenzen hinweg. Sie nutzen bestehende Standards, Technologien und Governance-Modelle der Datenwirtschaft, um Datensicherheit, ‑souveränität, ‑interoperabilität und ‑übertragbarkeit sowie das Vertrauen zwischen den Akteuren in eine faire Software-Infrastruktur zu integrieren. Sie basieren auf einer dezentralen Software-Infrastruktur, die die notwendigen Software-Funktionalitäten innerhalb eines Ökosystems aus Akteuren bereitstellt. Datenräume bieten eine Grundlage zur Entwicklung von Smart Services und innovativen unternehmensübergreifenden Geschäftsprozessen.“
Die Bayreuther Wirtschaftsinformatiker arbeiten übergreifend an der Beantwortung der Frage nach neuen Ansatzmöglichkeiten für eine Echtzeit-Energiewirtschaft und damit für einen effektiven Klimaschutz, um hier einen Beitrag für Umwelt und Gesellschaft zu leisten. Durch die Realisierung von Datenräumen können neue Anwendungsfelder erschlossen und neu gedacht werden, z.B. um die Umsetzung von Energy Communities, d.h. die Optimierung und Umsetzung von Peer-to-Peer-Energiehandel, voranzutreiben oder die Abstimmung der Ladevorgänge von Elektrofahrzeugen auf den lokalen Strommix und Lastprognosen besser abzustimmen.

Article: Emotionaler Saisonabschluss für den VC Eltmann
VCE feiert die Meisterschaft und ein ganz besonderes Jubiläum
Auch wenn der VC Eltmann schon seit dem letzten Heimspiel gegen Kriftel als sicherer Meister der Zweiten Volleyball Bundesliga feststand, feierte der Verein am vergangenem Samstag nochmals gemeinsam mit den heimischen Zuschauern die Meisterschaft, den Derbysieg und ein ganz besonderes Jubiläum. „Wir wollten uns unbedingt mit einem Sieg verabschieden, das Derby für uns entscheiden und zuhause ungeschlagen bleiben. Außerdem wollten wir Rolf noch einen schönen Abend bereiten und die Ehrung für 50 Jahre Volleyball in Eltmann mit einem Sieg krönen.“, so Manager Felix Reschke am Ende eines ereignisreichen und aufregenden Tages.
In einem sportlich nicht immer hochklassigem Spiel, bei dem beiden Mannschaften anzusehen war, dass den Spielern die lange Saison in den Knochen steckt, erwischte der Meister aus Eltmann den besseren Start und konnte sich gleich zu Beginn etwas absetzen. Beim Stande von 13:19 war der erste Satz eigentlich schon entschieden, doch Trainerfuchs Milan Maric fand nochmal die richtigen Worte, motivierte sein Team und sorgte dafür, dass das Spitzenteam aus Schwaig nochmal rankam und sich am Ende nur knapp mit 25:23 geschlagen geben musste. Im zweiten Satz begann der Gast aus Mittelfranken dann konzentrierter und kämpfte sich immer mehr in die Partie. Als die Anzeigetafel dann nur wenig später auf 12:7 für die Schwaiger umsprang, hatte Erfolgstrainer Christian Kranz dann genug gesehen und zog seine erste taktische Auszeit. Mit der idealen Mischung aus Strenge und Einfühlvermögen richtete der smarte und charmante Würzburger dann die richtigen Worte an sein Team, um dieses aufzuwecken und für den Rest des Satzes zu motivieren. „Er findet einfach immer die richtigen Worte und weiß einfach, wie er mit uns umgehen muss. Während der eine Spieler einen Tritt in den Allerwertesten braucht, brauchen manche Spieler manchmal einfach nur ein paar warme Worte und eine zärtliche Umarmung.“, so Diagonalspieler Jannis Hopt, der seinem Coach eine angenehm straffe Führung attestiert. Wenig später hatte der Aufsteiger die Partie dann auch schon auf den Kopf gestellt und konnte sich die Führung kurz vor Ende zurückerkämpfen. Nach etwa 23 Minuten hieß es dann 25:20 aus Sicht der Unterfranken, bevor sich beide Teams dann in eine denkwürdige zehnminütige Satzpause verabschiedeten. Diese Pause wurde dann jedoch nicht wie üblich dazu genutzt, sich nochmals zu besprechen und sich taktisch neu zu sortieren, sondern galt voll und ganz der Ehrung der Vereinslegende Rolf Werner. „Das war schon ein sehr emotionaler Moment und es war schön, dass nicht nur die Spieler und Verantwortlichen der diesjährigen Saison, sondern ich den schönen Moment auch mit Freunden, meiner Familie und ehemaligen Wegbegleitern teilen durfte.“, so das jetzige VCE Ehrenmitglied auf Lebenszeit. Besonders zu erwähnen sei an dieser Stelle die schöne Geste vom Gästetrainer Milan Maric, der es sich nicht nehmen ließ, ein paar emotionale Worte an Werner zu richten und auf die Ansprache an die eigenen Mannen verzichtete. „Das zeigt einfach nochmal, was für ein sympathischer Mensch er ist und dass wir hier in Franken einen sehr engen Zusammenhalt pflegen, was das ganze Tagesgeschäft sehr viel erträglicher und angenehmer für alle gestaltet.“, so Manager Reschke, der den letzten Part der Laudatio übernahm, ehe sich beide Mannschaften für den letzten Abschnitt der Partie vorbereiten durften.
Im letzten Abschnitt schien es, als hätte die emotionale Pause etwas den Wind aus den Eltmanner Segeln genommen und wie bereits im zweiten Satz waren es erstmal die Gäste, die besser ins Spiel fanden und sich eine knappe Führung herausspielen konnten. Wie man es aber mittlerweile vom Meister aus Eltmann gewohnt ist, kämpfte sich der Spitzenreiter zurück in die Partie und ließ keinen Zweifel daran, dass man das Match heute glatt in drei Sätzen für sich entscheiden möchte. Um 20:33 Uhr war es dann auch endlich so weit und die die Freude auf Seiten der Gastgeber kannte keiner Grenzen mehr als die Schiedsrichterin das Match beim Stande von 25:22 für den VCE abpfiff und offiziell beendete.
Was danach folgte war grenzenloser Jubel und pure Erleichterung in den Gesichtern der Spieler, Trainer und Verantwortlichen.
Nachdem alle Beteiligten Ihre Medaille erhalten hatten, stemmte Kapitän Johannes Engel dann endlich den Meisterpokal in die Höhe und sorgte dafür, dass sich die Georg-Schäfer-Halle noch einmal in ein echtes Tollhaus verwandelte. Zudem wurde am Rande der Feierlichkeiten noch bekannt gegeben, dass der VC Eltmann nicht nur als Titelverteidiger in die neue Zweitligasaison starten wird, sondern zudem auch unter einem neuen Namen antreten wird. Hauptsponsor Reiner Dümpert war sichtlich begeistert und veröffentlichte nur einen kurzen Moment darauf den neuen Namen „CERATONIA Volleys Eltmann“.
Was danach geschah, wo die Feier endete und welcher Spieler in welchem Zustand wo schlief, konnten wir leider bis Redaktionsschluss nicht herausfinden und es kann nur spekuliert werden, was sich in der Nacht von Samstag auf Sonntag in Eltmann, Bamberg und dem Rest Frankens noch abgespielt haben könnte.

Article: erlanger linke: „Richtigstellung zu Aussage von OB Janik über Mehrheitsverhältnissen zur StUB im Stadtrat“
Laut dem Artikel „Kulturkampf um die Stadt-Umland-Bahn“ der Erlanger Nachrichten vom 17.04.2024 behauptet der Erlanger Oberbürgermeister Florian Janik, es habe seit den letzten Stadtratswahlen keine Mehrheit „für die StUB“ gegeben. Dazu erklärt Johannes Pöhlmann, Vorsitzender der erlanger linke und ehemaliger Stadtrat:
„Der Erlanger Oberbürgermeister irrt. Seit den Kommunalwahlen 2020 gibt es eine Mehrheit für den Bau der Stadt-Umland-Bahn. SPD, Grüne Liste und Klimaliste unterstützen nach eigenen Aussagen die StUB, das sind 24 Stimmen im Stadtrat. Auch wir als erlanger linke befürworten den Bau der StUB grundsätzlich, das macht 26 Stimmen und somit eine absolute Mehrheit. Lediglich die von der Stadtregierung durchgesetzte Trassenführung hat im Stadtrat keine Mehrheit. Indem trotz förderfähiger Alternativen nur die umstrittene dritte Talquerung des Wiesengrunds beim Bürgerentscheid zur Wahl gestellt wird, wird die StUB insgesamt gefährdet.“

Article: FCE Bamberg braucht im „Abstiegskracher“ am Samstag volle Unterstützung
„Am Samstag alle ins Stadion“
Spannender kann der Kampf gegen den Abstieg in der Regionalliga Bayern kaum sein: Drei Spieltage vor Saisonende treffen die „Domreiter“ am Samstag, 4. Mai um 14 Uhr im Fuchs-Park-Stadion in einem „Do or Die“-Spiel auf den FC Memmingen. Beide Mannschaften trennen nur wenige Punkte, beide müssen unbedingt gewinnen, um das rettende Ufer noch zu erreichen.
Die Bamberger gehen in diese wegweisende Partie mit breiter Brust: Nach dem Sieg im letzten Heimspiel gegen den SV Schalding-Heining gelang der Truppe von Jan Gernlein am vergangenen Samstag ein weiteres Husarenstück: ein Auswärtssieg beim Tabellenzweiten in Vilzing.
„Die beiden letzten Spiele und Siege waren für uns überlebenswichtig“, betont Bambergs Fußball-Abteilungsleiter Sascha Dorsch. „Das war auch Balsam auf die Wunden aus den vorherigen Spiele, in denen wir nicht an unsere Leistungsgrenze gekommen sind. Nun haben wir das Gefühl, dass wir rechtzeitig zur ‚Crunchtime‘ fit sind und wollen unbedingt gegen Memmingen den dritten Erfolg in Serie einfahren.“
Klar ist: Gewinnen die Bamberger diese Partie, haben sie die direkten Abstiegsplätze erst einmal hinter sich gelassen – bei einer Niederlage ist Zittern bis zum letzten Spieltag angesagt. Deshalb bitten die Domreiter um Unterstützung der Fußballfans aus der gesamten Region am Samstag im Fuchs-Park-Stadion. „Alle ins Stadion“ lautet das Motto.
Als Anreiz gibt es zwei besondere Aktionen: Treue Vereinsmitglieder erhalten bis zu 5 Freitickets für die Gegengerade, um die Mannschaft nach vorne zu peitschen. Einfach eine kurze E‑Mail mit Vorname, Name und Anschrift an s.dorsch@fce2010.de
Außerdem verlost der FCE 1 x 2 Tickets für die neue „Sky VIP Lounge“ direkt unter dem Stadiondach, inklusive Catering und Besuch der Pressekonferenz. Bis 2. Mai (12 Uhr) kann sich jede und jeder ebenfalls per E‑Mail bewerben an info@fce2010.de

Article: Geldabholer nach Schockanruf in Hirschaid verhaftet
Gemeinsame Pressemitteilung des Polizeipräsidiums Oberfranken und der Staatsanwaltschaft Bamberg
Am Freitag haben Schockanrufer versucht, eine 65-jährige Frau aus Hirschaid um einen hohen fünfstelligen Geldbetrag zu bringen. Die Frau erkannte jedoch die Masche und half so, den Geldabholer festzunehmen. Ein Richter erließ am Samstag auf Antrag der Staatsanwaltschaft Bamberg Haftbefehl.
Am Freitagmittag riefen Unbekannte die 65-jährige Frau aus Hirschaid an. Die Anrufer schilderten ihr, dass ihre Tochter in einen tödlichen Verkehrsunfall verwickelt sei. Sie müsse deshalb eine Kaution in Höhe von 22.000 Euro aufbringen, um einen Gefängnisaufenthalt abzuwenden. Die Frau erkannte die Masche und ließ sofort die Polizei informieren. So konnten mehrere Streifen der Verkehrspolizei, des Zentralen Ergänzungsdienstes und der Kriminalpolizei Bamberg den Geldabholer am Freitagnachmittag festnehmen. Es handelt sich hierbei um einen 21-jährigen polnischen Staatsangehörigen.
Der Mann muss sich nun wegen des versuchten banden- und gewerbsmäßigen Betruges verantworten. Auf Antrag der Staatsanwaltschaft Bamberg erließ ein Richter am Samstag Haftbefehl. Der 21-Jährige sitzt inzwischen in einer Justizvollzugsanstalt ein.

Zu einem Jahr in den USA lädt MdB Thomas Silberhorn (CSU) Schülerinnen und Schüler sowie junge Berufstätige ein. Der Bundestagsabgeordnete für Bamberg und Forchheim unterstützt auch in diesem Jahr das Parlamentarische Patenschaftsprogramm zwischen Deutschem Bundestag und US-Kongress.

Article: Philip Jalalpoor beendet seine Bayreuther Spielerkarriere
Nach 25 Jahren im Leistungssport hat sich der Kapitän des BBC Bayreuth entschieden, seine Spielerkarriere zu beenden und eine neue Herausforderung als Trainer anzunehmen. Der 30-Jährige kehrt an die Universität von Vancouver (UBC) zurück, wo er bereits seinen Bachelor-Abschluss gemacht hat, und wird dort ab sofort hauptberuflich als Assistenztrainer arbeiten.
Philip war als Spieler in 7 Ländern aktiv und absolvierte insgesamt 87 Spiele für medi bayreuth und den BBC Bayreuth. Höhepunkt der Karriere des Deutsch-Iraners war die Teilnahme an den Olympischen Spielen 2020 in Tokio.
Philip Jalalpoor: „Nach langen Überlegungen habe ich mich mit meiner Familie dazu entschieden, einen neuen Weg einzuschlagen. Diese Entscheidung ist uns nicht leicht gefallen, da wir vor allem seitens der Fans des BBC Bayreuth und dem gesamten Umfeld wahnsinnig viel Unterstützung erfahren haben. Diese einmalige Gelegenheit ermöglicht es mir, meiner Leidenschaft für Basketball auch nach meiner aktiven Karriere weiter auf höchstem Niveau nachgehen zu können, weshalb ich zu diesem Entschluss gekommen bin. Wir werden Bayreuth immer in sehr guter Erinnerung behalten.“
In der vergangenen Saison hat Philip auf dem Spielfeld eine wichtige Führungsrolle übernommen und sich abseits des Feldes als Trainer im Nachwuchsbereich engagiert und in Zusammenarbeit mit ISPEX ein Nachhaltigkeitskonzept für den BBC Bayreuth entwickelt.
Friedrich Hartung: „Philip ist ein Vorbild für jeden Mitspieler und alle Nachwuchsspieler. Er hat auf dem Feld immer alles gegeben und neben dem Feld seine Erfahrungen geteilt. Natürlich hätten wir Philip auch weiterhin gerne in der Oberfrankenhalle gesehen, aber diese Chance hat er sich erarbeitet und absolut verdient. Im Namen der gesamten Organisation bedanke ich mich deshalb für sein Engagement und wünsche Philip beruflich und privat alles gute für die Zukunft.“

Autofahrt wegen Drogenkonsum gestoppt
Ein 21 Jahre alter Autofahrer wurde am Dienstag nach 01.00 Uhr in Adelsdorf einer Verkehrskontrolle unterzogen. Dabei stellten die Beamten der Polizeiinspektion Höchstadt a.d. Aisch Hinweise auf Drogenkonsum fest und veranlassten eine Blutentnahme bei dem Mann. Bei einem Nachweis von Drogen im Blut drohen ihm ein Fahrverbot von mindestens einem Monat und 500 Euro Geldbuße. Die Fahrt war am Kontrollort erst einmal zu Ende.
Schmierereien
Im Weingartsgraben und An der Steige in Höchstadt wurden in der Zeit von Samstag 20.00 Uhr bis Sonntag 12.00 Uhr ein Haus und ein Omnibus von unbekannten Tätern mit schwarzer und roter Farbe besprüht. Hinweise zur Tat oder den Tätern werden wie immer von der Polizeiinspektion Höchstadt a.d. Aisch unter der Telefonnummer 09193/63940 entgegengenommen.

20-Jähriger flüchtet nach Geschwindigkeitsverstoß vor Polizei
COBURG. Bei einer Laserkontrolle im Coburger Stadtgebiet überschritt ein 20-Jähriger mit seinem Opel am Montag, in den späten Abendstunden, die zulässige Höchstgeschwindigkeit innerhalb geschlossener Ortschaften massiv. Bei der Anhaltung an der Kontrollstelle flüchtete der Fahranfänger.
Einsatzkräfte der Coburger Polizeiinspektion führten um 22.30 Uhr eine Lasergeschwindigkeitsmessung in der Lauterer Straße durch. In stadteinwärtiger Richtung zeigte die Lasermesspistole bei dem Opel eine Geschwindigkeit von 102 km/h innerhalb geschlossener Ortschaften an. Zur Anhaltung stellte sich ein 42-jähriger Polizeibeamter, erkennbar an seiner retroreflektierten Warnweste und der beleuchteten Warnkelle, auf die Straße. Dies erkannte der Opel-Fahrer, legte zunächst eine Vollbremsung hin, beschleunigte im Anschluss sein Fahrzeug, fuhr an dem Polizisten vorbei und flüchtete. Im Zuge einer sofort eingeleiteten Fahndung stellten die Beamten den 20-Jährigen an seiner Wohnanschrift in Rödental. Neben dem massiven Geschwindigkeitsverstoß ermitteln die Beamten nun wegen gefährlichem Eingriffs in den Straßenverkehr sowie einem verbotenen Kraftfahrzeugrennen.

Article: Spielbericht ASV Weisendorf – SG Burk/Schlaifhausen/Leutenbach 0:3 (0:1)
Erneuter Sieg in der Ferne
Beim dritten Auswärtsspiel in Folge konnte die Spielgemeinschaft den dritten Sieg einfahren und sich damit erneut ein Stück von den Abstiegsplätzen absetzen.
Dabei erwischte die Porzelt-Elf den besseren Start und hatte die erste Gelegenheit durch Sophia Huberth. Darauf hatte Carina Nögel die Führung auf dem Fuß, doch nach einer Ecke von Natascha Porzelt stand die Latte im Weg (5.). Danach kam die Heimmannschaft besser in die Partie, wohingegen die Gäste zu ungeduldig agierten und teilweise unkonzentriert wirkten. Zweimal wurde es dabei gefährlich vor dem SG-Tor. Vor allem in der 34. Spielminute hatte die SG Glück, als Laura Mönch einen Schnitzer in Burks Hintermannschaft nicht ausnutzen konnte und das Spielgerät hauchdünn am Tor vorbeisetzte. Nach einem der nun selteneren Angriffe über Burks linke Angriffsseite flankte Porzelt in die Mitte, wo Selina Pelch goldrichtig stand und zur umjubelten Führung einnetzen konnte (39.). Diese knappe Führung konnte die SG in die Pause retten.
Kurz nach der Halbzeit wurde Pelch von Alexandra Loukas auf die Reise geschickt. Den Abschluss von Pelch aus halbrechter Position konnte Torhüterin Franziska Engelhardt sehenswert zur Ecke lenken (51.). Nach einer Serie an darauffolgenden Eckbällen fiel dann das 2:0 aus Sicht der Gäste. Dabei brachte Porzelt das Spielgerät in die Mitte, wo Loukas wuchtig einköpfte (55.). Danach verflachte der Spielverlauf wieder. Gegen Ende der Partie wurde es dann etwas hitzig. Leider ließ sich auch der Schiedsrichter von den Kommentaren von Außen beirren. Leidtragend waren dabei die Spielerinnen der SG, als vor allem in zwei Situationen sehr zweifelhaft gegen die Gäste entschieden wurde. In der 86. Minute fiel dann die Entscheidung nach erneutem Porzelt-Eckball. Wieder kam Loukas an den Ball, deren Schuss noch abgeblockt werden konnte Letztendlich traf dann eine Heimakteurin ins eigene Tor zum 0:3‑Endstand.

Article: SpVgg Bayreuth bei den Würzburger Kickers chancenlos
Eine 0:3‑Niederlage, die schon nach 26 Minuten feststand, musste die SpVgg Bayreuth heute Abend in der Regionalliga Bayern bei den Würzburger Kickers hinnehmen.
Im ersten Spiel nach seiner Beförderung zum offiziellen Cheftrainer konnte Lukas Kling außer den Langzeitverletzten Tim Latteier und Jonas Kehl sowie den beiden erkrankten Jakub Mintal und Tobias Weber auf den vollen Kader zurückgreifen. Auch David Ismail war nach seiner Verletzungspause wieder im Aufgebot.
Die bereits als Regionalligameister feststehenden Würzburger und die Altstadt, die einen einstelligen Tabellenplatz als aktuelles Saisonziel ausgegeben hat, lieferten sich von Anfang an eine muntere Partie. In der 18. Minute hatten die Gastgeber eine erste Chance durch Dardan Kamiani, SpVgg-Keeper Lucas Zahaczewski war jedoch zur Stelle. Besser machte es drei Minuten später Benyas Solomon Junge-Abiol, der nach einer Flanke von Maximilian Zaiser zur 1:0‑Führung für die Kickers einköpfte (21.).
Jetzt sollte es schnell gehen: In der 24. Minute schickte Saliou Sane Dardan Karimani auf die Reise, der frei vor Lucas Zahaczewski die Nerven behielt und zum 2:0 für die Gastgeber einschob. Nur zwei Minuten später erhöhte Dominik Meisel nach toller Vorarbeit von Kapitän Peter Kurzweg auf 3:0 (26.)
Lukas Kling reagierte mit zwei Auswechslungen, Patrick Scheder kam für Bohdan Potalov und Eduard Heckmann für Daniel Haubner. In der 38. Minute hatte Edwin Schwarz die große Chance zum Anschlusstreffer, Kickers-Torwart Vincent Friedsam klärte jedoch mit einer Parade zur Ecke. Kurz darauf klärte Edwin Schwarz im letzten Moment bei einer scharfen Hereingabe von Peter Kurzweg. Mit der 3:0‑Führung der klar besseren Unterfranken ging es schließlich in die Halbzeitpause.
In der 51. Minute musste die SpVgg einen weiteren Nackenschlag hinnehmen: Marco Zietsch sah nach einem Foulspiel die Gelb-Rote Karte. In Überzahl hatten die Kickers die Partie vor 1.621 Zuschauern weiter fest im Griff und konnten souverän agieren. In der 69. Minute hatte der gerade eingewechselte Benjika Caciel aus kurzer Distanz eine Kopfballchance für die Würzburger, verfehlte aber das Gehäuse. In der 88. Minute setzte Benyas Solomon Junge-Abiol den Ball nach einer Hereingabe von Benjica Caciel knapp über den Bayreuther Kasten.
Letztlich blieb es beim 3:0‑Sieg der Gastgeber. Die Altstadt hat nach 32 Spielen jetzt weiter 41 Punkte auf dem Konto. “Es war wahrlich kein gutes Spiel von uns. Wir hatten gehofft, dass das Team nach der Sicherstellung des Klassenerhalts befreit nach vorne aufspielt und vielleicht einen Punkt mitnimmt, dies haben wir aber nicht ansatzweise geschafft. Nach dem ersten Gegentreffer haben wir die Ordnung verloren und nicht mehr wiedergefunden. Binnen fünf Minuten ging es Schlag auf Schlag und es stand 0:3. Dann kam in der 51. Minute noch die Gelb-Rote Karte gegen Marco Zietsch, die uns endgültig das Genick brach. Im Mittelfeld fehlte uns etwas die ordnende Hand. Mit der Einwechslung einiger Nachwuchskräfte hat unser Trainer dann noch einen gewissen Fingerzeig in die Zukunft gegeben. Letztlich sah man einfach, wer der Regionalligameister ist”, analysierte SpVgg-Geschäftsführer Jörg Schmalfuß nach der Partie.

In Erlangen sind heute schon am Vorabend des 1. Mai die Jugendorganisationen der Gewerkschaften zusammen mit den Jusos, der Jungen Linken und der Grünen Jugend auf die Straße gegangen.
Unter dem Motto „Reiche zur Kasse, Kampf für die Klasse“ forderten die Redner*innen mehr bezahlbaren Wohnraum, mehr Investitionen in die Bildungs- und Sozialpolitik, Mitbestimmung von Beschäftigten, die Abschaffung der Schuldenbremse und eine Zivilklausel für Universitäten. Im Kern der Forderungen standen außerdem höhere Löhne und mehr Tarifbindung.

Eine 42-jährige Hotelbewohnerin warf am Montagnachmittag eine Weinflasche von einem Balkon und traf damit ein Kind am Kopf. Die Kriminalpolizei Hof ermittelt und bittet um Zeugenhinweise.
Am Montag, gegen 13.45 Uhr, war eine Gruppe Kinder mit ihren Betreuern zu Fuß in der Hofer Liebigstraße unterwegs.

Article: Bamberg Baskets komplettieren frühzeitig ihren Coaching Staff
Der Coaching Staff der Bamberg Baskets für die kommenden Spielzeiten ist komplett. Nach der Verpflichtung von Anton Gavel als neuem Head Coach und der Vertragsverlängerung mit Arne Woltmann, ist nun auch die Position des Athletiktrainers langfristig besetzt.
Wie bei der Weiterverpflichtung von Arne Woltmann setzen die Bamberg Baskets auch auf dieser Position auf Kontinuität und bewährte Qualität, weshalb der Vertrag mit dem bisherigen Athletiktrainer Marc Olmos um drei weitere Jahre verlängert wurde. Der 29-jährige Spanier wird sich somit auch weiterhin um die Ausdauer, Schnelligkeit, Koordination, Kraft und Beweglichkeit der Spieler kümmern.
Mit Stefan Weissenböck, dem Head of player development, ist der Coaching Staff der Bamberg Baskets damit bereits frühzeitig für die kommende Spielzeit vollständig besetzt.

Article: Bamberger Landkreisbier „36 Kreisla“ wird ein Export naturtrüb
Im Jubiläumsjahr brauen vier Brauereien der Gemeinde Memmelsdorf den Gerstensaft des Landkreises
Im zehnten Jahr seines Bestehens werden vier Brauereien aus der Gemeinde Memmelsdorf das „36 Kreisla“ brauen: Hummel (Merkendorf), Höhn (Memmelsdorf), Drei Kronen (Memmelsdorf) und Göller (Drosendorf). „Damit haben sich bereits mehr als die Hälfte unserer 65 Brauereien an dem Gemeinschaftsprojekt beteiligt“, ist Landrat Johann Kalb stolz auf die Brautradition im Bamberger Land.
„Der Gerstensaft im Jubiläumsjahr wird ein ‚Export naturtrüb‘ werden.“ Das hat der Landrat in dieser Woche mit den Verantwortlichen der vier Brauereien Isabella Mereien, Julius und Georg Hummel, Jonas Göller und Georg Höhn vereinbart. Ende Juli soll das diesjährige „36 Kreisla“ eingebraut werden. Der Anstich erfolgt jedes Jahr traditionell am sogenannten „Brauersilvester“, am 30. September.
Der Landkreis Bamberg ist von einer über die Jahrhunderte gewachsenen Bierkultur geprägt, die sich in der höchsten Privatbrauereidichte weltweit widerspiegelt. Noch heute existieren 65 Brauereien im Landkreis, meist familiengeführt, handwerklich geprägt und vielfältig im Angebot ihrer Biersorten. Um diese weltweit einmalige Vielfalt zu erhalten und zu stärken, hatte Landrat Johann Kalb 2014 die Idee, ein eigenes Landkreisbier zu entwickeln. 2021 gewinnt das Landkreisbier die „Goldene BierIdee“. Die Auszeichnung würdigt Personen oder Initiativen, die sich in besonderer Weise um die Präsentation bayerischer Bierspezialitäten verdient gemacht haben.

Article: Christine Neubauer kommt nach Eckental ins Kino
Die CASINO Lichtspiele Eckental zeigen am 2. Mai den Film „Hundswut“, eine bayerische Produktion.
Die Schauspielerin Christine Neubauer, der Regisseur Daniel Alvarenga und weitere Crew Mitglieder kommen im Rahmen einer Kinotour zu uns nach Eckental.
Es gibt zwei Veranstaltungen um 16:15 Uhr und um 19:30 Uhr ( bereits ausgebucht)
Kurzinhalt „Hundswut“
In einem bayerischen Dorf von 1932 geschehen grausame Morde. Der Gemeinderat schiebt die Tat einem tollwütigen Wolf zu, um die Dorfbewohner zu beruhigen. Als Gerüchte über einen menschlichen oder gar werwolfähnlichen Mörder aufkommen, wird der Einsiedler Joseph Köhler als Verdächtiger verhaftet. Als er hartnäckig bestreitet, die Taten begangen zu haben, eskaliert die Stimmung und gipfelt schließlich in Gewalt. Die Frauen des Dorfes setzen alles daran, dem irrationalen Wahnsinn der eigentlich vernünftigen Dorfbewohner entgegenzutreten. Inspiriert von einem der letzten dokumentierten Hexenprozesse und eingebettet in die unruhige Ära kurz vor dem Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkriegs entfaltet der Film eine zeitlose Intensität, obwohl seine Handlung vor beinahe 100 Jahren angesiedelt ist

Article: Nach Überfall in Bamberg sind zwei Tatverdächtige in Haft
Gemeinsame Pressemitteilung des Polizeipräsidiums Oberfranken und der Staatsanwaltschaft Bamberg
BAMBERG. Freitagnacht sollen zwei Männer 50 Euro Bargeld und das Mobiltelefon eines 35-Jährigen unter Anwendung von Gewalt entwendet haben. Eine Richterin erließ inzwischen auf Antrag der Staatsanwaltschaft Bamberg Haftbefehle gegen zwei Tatverdächtige im Alter von 35 und 27 Jahren.
Zwei Männern wird vorgeworfen, am Freitag gegen 22:15 Uhr einen 35-jährigen Marokkaner an der Kettenbrücke überfallen zu haben. Die zwei Tatverdächtigen sollen auf den 35-Jährigen eingeschlagen und eingetreten haben. Im Anschluss sollen sie sein Bargeld und sein Mobiltelefon an sich genommen haben und geflüchtet sein. Zwei Zeugen erkannten die Tatverdächtigen, einen 35-jährigen Algerier und einen 27-jährigen Marokkaner wieder und ermöglichten so die Festnahme der beiden. Die Hintergründe der Tat sind noch unklar.
Die Kriminalpolizei Bamberg hat die Ermittlungen aufgenommen. Auf Antrag der Staatsanwaltschaft Bamberg erließ eine Ermittlungsrichterin am vergangenen Wochenende Haftbefehle gegen die Tatverdächtigen. Diese sitzen nun in einer Justizvollzugsanstalt ein.

Article: Neue Aktionen von „Buntes Bamberg“ zur Europawahl
Brandmauer, Bierdeckel und überparteilicher Wahlaufruf Mai 2024
Im Vorfeld der Europawahlen plant Buntes Bamberg eine Reihe von Aktionen. Wir wollen damit das Bewusstsein für unsere demokratischen Werte, für Vielfalt, Toleranz und respektvolles Miteinander stärken – und wir wollen gleichzeitig für die Gefahr sensibilisieren, die von populistischen Kräften, Falschinformationen und rechtsextremer Hetze ausgeht.
Ab dem 4. Mai kann man sich in der Bamberger Fußgängerzone über alle Parteien informieren, die zur Europawahl antreten.
Wir sind auch wieder am Start, um mit unserer Brandmauer gegen Rechts daran zu erinnern: Vorsicht vor populistischen Parolen, scheinbar einfachen Antworten, Falschinformationen und rechter Hetze. Wählt Demokratie, wählt eine demokratische Partei! Wer ab dem 5. Mai eine Bamberger Gaststätte oder ein Café besucht, könnte dort unsere „Vielfalt“-Bierfilzchen vorfinden.
Die Idee entstand, als die AfD begann, Stammtische in Lokalen in und um Bamberg abzuhalten. Ziel ist eine friedliche Protestform gemeinsam mit den Betreiber*innen. Und nun können alle interessierten Gaststätten ein Paket von uns anfordern.
Am 5. Mai verteilen wir zudem Pakete in den Gaststätten in der Innenstadt.
In den teilnehmenden Lokalen können ab dann alle Gäste darauf anstoßen, dass Bamberg ist ein Ort der Vielfalt und der Toleranz ist und bleibt.
In Zusammenarbeit mit fast aller demokratischen Bamberger Fraktionen, Parteien und vieler Organisationen der Zivilgesellschaft ist ein Aufruf entstanden, wählen zu gehen, aber demokratisch.
Demokratisch wählen – Aufruf zur Europawahl
Wahltermin: 9. Juni 2024
Wir leben in einem demokratischen Land, mit Grundrechten, die für alle Menschen gelten, insbesondere Meinungsfreiheit und Pressefreiheit. All das ist nicht selbstverständlich, und aktuell wieder bedroht von radikalen Kräften.
Unsere Demokratie ist wehrhaft – allerdings nur, solange sie existiert. Wird eine Demokratie auf demokratischem Weg abgewählt, verschwinden die Möglichkeiten, sie zurückzubringen, oder auch nur das neue System zu kritisieren, meist als erstes.
Was als Protestwahl beginnt, kann als Diktatur enden. Was geschieht, wenn ein System autokratisch wird, sah man 1933 in Deutschland. Man sieht es beispielsweise in Russland oder in Iran. Wie schnell eine stabile Demokratie ins Wanken geraten kann, sieht man u.a. in den USA und in Israel.
Wir leben in einer Zeit von Krisen und Wandel. Frust und Wut sind verständlich. Aber unsere Freiheit und unsere Rechte aufs Spiel zu setzen ist nicht die Antwort.
Aus Protest oder Unzufriedenheit heraus eine in Teilen gesichert rechtsextremistische Partei wie die AfD zu unterstützen, ist keine konstruktive Form von Kritik, politischem Diskurs oder freier Meinungsäußerung. Es ist der Anfang vom Ende dieser Freiheiten.
Parteien, die Prinzipien wie die Würde und die Gleichheit aller Menschen nicht würdigen, können nicht als demokratisch gelten.
Gehen Sie am 9. Juni wählen. Aber wählen Sie demokratisch. Damit Sie auch in Zukunft noch wählen dürfen.
Schulterschluss für Demokratie!

Article: Vortrag „Besser leben ohne Plastik“ in der Forchheimer Stadtbücherei
Referentin Nadine Schubert gab viele Tipps
Veranstaltung zum Earthday 2024 – BLoP – Besser leben ohne Plastik
Frau Nadine Schubert hat sich bereits 2013 entschlossen, ihren Haushalt plastikfrei zu machen und hat diese Entwicklung mit inzwischen 3 Sachbüchern begleitet. Ihre Erfahrungen teilt sie gerne mit und möchte am liebsten gute Nachrichten verbreiten. Der perfekt plastikfreie Haushalt bleibt weiter ihr Ziel. Es ist aber auch klar, dass es in unserer Gesellschaft völlig ohne Kunststoffe nicht mehr geht. Es lohnt sich aber „gutes“ von
„schlechtem“ Plastik zu unterscheiden. „Gutes“ zeichnet sich durch lange Nutzungsdauer aus, diesem sollte man deshalb einen Wert geben. Wenn möglich sollte man besonders Elektrogeräte reparieren lassen, z.B. im Reparatur Café´ im Zukunftshaus in Forchheim. Je kürzer die Nutzungsdauer ist (50 % der Kunststoffprodukte landen immerhin nach weniger als einem Monat im Müll), desto mehr sollte es vermieden werden. „Schlechtes“ Plastik, das man z.B. riechen kann sollte man keinesfalls erwerben, denn es gast Schadstoffe aus. Das belastet die Gesundheit.
Die Kunststoffproduktion sollte bis 2040 dringend reduziert werden, besser für uns Menschen wäre eine Reduktion um 60%. Als Beispiel für schlechtes und damit nicht nötiges Plastik nennt Frau Schubert u.a. beschichtete Bäckertüten. Ein kleiner Backbetrieb verbraucht davon 63.000 Stück im Jahr. Das lässt sich einsparen, indem man zum Bäcker einen Stoffbeutel mitbringt. Der beste Lagerplatz für Backwaren zu Hause ist nach ihrer Ansicht der Backofen. Bezüglich Reinigungs- und Körperpflegemitteln gibt Frau Schubert viele kostengünstige Rezepte auf Kernseifenbasis weiter. Damit vermeiden wir große Mengen an Mikroplastik, das inzwischen auch in vielen menschlichen Organen nachgewiesen ist. Die zahlreichen Plastik-Einspar-Tipps und Rezepte sind in Frau Schuberts Fachbüchern nachzulesen, inzwischen gibt es auch eines für die Jüngsten. Wir als Verbraucher können mit unseren Kaufentscheidungen für Änderungen in Richtung Kreislaufwirtschaft beitragen. Frau Schubert rät deshalb, statt bei großen Geschäften lieber in kleinen Läden, z.B. Unverpackt-Läden einzukaufen, regional und saisonal. Damit wird unser Geld bei „Bessermachern“ ausgegeben.

Article: Werfer der UAC Kulmbach/TSV Stadtsteinach auf dem Werfertag in Wiesau
Am Samstag den 27. April fand in Wiesau bei Sonnenschein, aber kühlem Wind der traditionelle Werfertag statt, zu dem 123 Athlet:innen aus 21 Vereinen angetreten sind. Die Werfer der Trainingsgruppe des UAC Kulmbach/TSV Stadtsteinach waren mit 10 Personen aller Altersklassen vertreten.
Neben erfahrenen Athleten waren in den jüngsten Altersgruppen der W12 Valerie Hacker und bei den Jungs Jamie Schulz in seinem ersten Wettkampf in der Altersklasse M13 am Start. Valerie schraubte ihre Bestweite im Hammerwurf mit dem 2 kg ‑Wurfgerät auf eine neue persönliche Bestleistung von beachtlichen 38,01 Metern, Jamie wuchtete seinen 3 kg-Schweren Hammer mit eineinhalb Drehungen auf 30,81 Meter, was ihm neben dem Tagessieg in dieser Altersklasse auch den ersten Platz in der aktuellen bayerischen Bestenliste einbrachte. Auch der 750 g schwere Diskus flog mit 20,45 Metern über die 20 Meter-Marke.
Eintragen auf Platz 2 in die Deutsche Bestenliste im Hammerwurf der Altersklasse M15 durfte sich Kai Konopacki, der den Wettbewerb mit persönlicher Bestleistung von 53,40 Meter vor Oliver Ispan vom TSV Plattling mit 49,21 Metern gewann. In der nächsthöheren Altersklasse U18, in der die 16 und 17 Jährigen antreten, waren die Kulmbach / Stadtsteinacher Werfer durch Matti Hummel im Hammerwurf und Diskus vertreten, der mit dem 5 kg Hammer auf 62,82 Meter warf, wobei deutlich weitere Versuche leider nicht im Sektor landeten und ungültig waren. Der Diskus flog 44,28 Meter, was Platz 2 hinter Christof Zierer aus Plattling (47,25 m) bedeutete, der dafür im Hammerwurfduell mit einer Weite von 32,80 Metern den deutlich kürzeren Wurf hatte.
Einen guten dritten Paltz sicherte sich Paul Hensen im Kugelstossen der U20 mit 11,36 m. Ebenfalls in der U20 startete der aus Staffelstein stammende Max Hübner, der den Sieg im Speerwurf mit 54,81 Meter sowie Platz eins im Hammerwurf (45,74 m) ebenfalls in die Trainingsgruppe holte.
Die für den UAC startende, amtierende Bayerische Winter-Speerwurf Meisterin Alina Schütz musste sich im Speerwurf der Frauen mit Platz 3 begnügen, holte sich dann allerdings im Kugelstossen mit fast einem halben Meter Vorsprung auf die Zweitplatzierte Nele Ganßmüller von der LG Fichtelgebirge mit einem Stoss auf 10,97 Meter in dieser Disziplin den Sieg.
Im Hammerwerfen der Frauen gingen die Plätze 1 mit 52,18 Meter an Leonie Liebenwald und 3 mit 37,06 Meter an Margitta Grötsch ebenfalls nach Oberfranken.
Der Bruder von Leonie, Linus Liebenwald holte sich mit einer Weite von 58,94 Metern in seinem ersten Jahr mit dem 7,26 kg schweren Wurfgerät Platz 1 vor dem deutlich älteren Andreas Bauer aus Burglengenfeld.
