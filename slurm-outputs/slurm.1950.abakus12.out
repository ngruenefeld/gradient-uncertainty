Article: Jessica Simpson dazzled in a new image shared on Instagram this week, where she was seen promoting her new collaboration with Walmart.
The fashion-forward entrepreneur and singer, known for her Jessica Simpson Collection, looked stunning in a bright green bikini.
The ensemble showcased Jessica's incredible figure following her notable 100-pound weight loss after the birth of her third child with husband Eric Johnson.
The 43-year-old mother of three styled her hair down, adding a touch of glam with a straw hat and jewelled belt and skirt.
She posed gracefully by the shore, embodying the vibrant spirit of her new collection. "We’re so excited to share our collaboration with @walmart!" Jessica shared in her caption.
"An all-new collection of over 100 pieces across apparel and swimwear (styles you won’t find anywhere else!) and jewelry to help you style a versatile, affordable, easy-to-wear summer wardrobe! Available in sizes XS-4X (apparel) and XXL (swim) at select @walmart stores and online! #WalmartFashion," she enthused about the partnership.
In another heartfelt caption, Jessica described her style for the day as 'Cali boho meets Texas charm.'
The A Public Affair singer's venture with Walmart features an exclusive collection that includes everything from swimwear to everyday apparel, all infused with her signature style.
The promotional video for the collaboration highlights several photoshoots, showcasing the breadth and appeal of the new collection.
Jessica also took a moment to reflect on the mission of her brand, stating, "We can't wait to help even more women feel their absolute best and most confident in what they wear."
Her brand, which launched in 2005 initially focusing on footwear, has since expanded into a full-fledged lifestyle brand embracing clothing and home goods. The transition reflects Jessica's evolving personal style and her deep commitment to accessible fashion.
The entrepreneur, alongside her mother Tina, regained control of the brand in 2021 after its parent company faced financial difficulties.
This move underscored her dedication to her business and her desire to keep her brand closely aligned with her vision and values. Jessica shared with People magazine how she draws design inspiration from various sources, including music, art, and her children. "I get my design inspiration from everywhere, like a song I love or a piece of art. I love vintage fashion, so I am always looking through archival prints and cuts," she explained.
Particularly inspired by her eldest daughter, Maxwell, Jessica admires her unique fashion sense and infectious confidence. "I am very inspired by my daughter Maxwell. Her pulse on fashion is so unique. She is an infectious trendsetter and always effortlessly confident," she proudly stated.
Jessica, who also embraces her role as a mother with fervor, recently spoke about her increased confidence since becoming a parent.
She expressed a newfound appreciation for her body's capabilities, saying, "It wasn't until I became a mother that I learned to celebrate what a woman's body can do. I am more confident now after three kids than I was at 25!"
With her family, including her supportive husband Eric and their three children, Jessica continues to balance her busy life with flair. The couple, who married in 2014, share daughters Maxwell Drew and Birdie Mae, as well as son Ace Knute.
Jessica’s diet secrets
Jessica is believed to have lost around 100lbs. This impressive transformation followed the birth of her third child, Birdie, in 2019. Opening up about her journey, Jessica shared with E! News, “I went to a nutritionist, and I needed to get my eating habits right.”
Earlier this year, she humorously dismissed rumors of using the weight-loss drug Ozempic, reflecting on her body's evolution over the years with Bustle, “I am fortunate to have been every size... For [my] brand, understanding the women [who buy our products] and for my psyche.”

Article: Police surround Columbia University as antiwar protests grow at U.S. campuses
Updated April 30, 2024 at 21:15 PM ET
New York police surrounded Columbia University and activists put out calls for more protestors on social media as the chaotic pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus appeared to reach a turning point late Tuesday.
Protesters have occupied the central campus building of Hamilton Hall for most of Tuesday, after the school asked them to voluntarily disperse from an encampment.
The NYPD, with some officers seen in riot gear and carrying zip tie handcuffs, blocked off sections of Broadway near the Columbia Morningside campus late Tuesday.
Activists asked supporters on social media to "mobilize." And people have shown up. A large crowd of protesters gathered outside of the gates of the campus Tuesday evening.
The tensions are one snapshot of protests erupting at college campuses across the U.S. The students are calling for universities to sell off their investments in companies that have businesses or investments in Israel because of the country's invasion of Gaza.
The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, while Israel says some 1,200 Israelis were killed by Hamas in an assault last October. Israel says Hamas is still holding 133 hostages.
Columbia has started suspending the students who have refused to leave and they now face expulsion.
In announcing the disciplinary actions, the school saidon Tuesday that the protesters "have chosen to escalate to an untenable situation."
Two prominent New York Democrats, U.S. Reps. Jerry Nadler and Adriano Espailla, called on the school to "move quickly and swiftly to remove the students who have engaged in unlawful activity."
They wrote in a shared statement that the students are entitled to free speech, but criticized recent actions of the demonstrations at Columbia.
On the other side of the U.S., students broke into the library at Portland State University in Oregon, triggering a campus-wide shutdown.
Many such demonstrations continue with no end in sight, but administrations at Northwestern University and Brown University managed to strike deals with protesters that included agreements to examine the schools' investments.
Campuses see big protests across the U.S.
In Oregon, Portland State University closed its campus on Tuesday, after demonstrators took over the school's library. The protesters broke into the Branford Price Millar Library during the night, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports.
Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt's office said his position is that "the actions taking place have crossed into criminal behavior, and we will prosecute."
Earlier on Tuesday at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, police arrested demonstrators who refused to shut down a "Gaza Solidarity Encampment" protest that began at the Polk Place quad on campus Friday.
Police detained some 30 protesters and moved them elsewhere on campus, according to student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel, which says six people in the group were arrested. Video posted on Instagram by the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine showed UNC police chief Brian James informing protesters that they were trespassing, as they chanted, "We will not stop, we will not rest."
UNC interim Chancellor Lee Roberts and Provost Christopher Clemens sent a letter early Tuesday ordering protesters to dismantle the camp and leave, threatening arrests and potential expulsion.
On Monday, police arrested nearly 80 people protesting in support of Palestinians at the University of Texas at Austin after demonstrators set up an encampment on the south lawn, according to member station KUT.
"Police and troopers in riot gear surrounded the protesters and made arrests," KUT reports.
UT Austin says that protesters "escalated by becoming physically and verbally combative" when approached, adding that it moved against the encampment because demonstrators' tents violated school rules. The arrests were for trespassing or disorderly conduct, it said.
The Palestine Solidarity Committee in Austin, a group organizing protests, condemned school president Jay Hartzell's administration for "yet again calling police to violently suppress students" — a reference to dozens of arrests made last Wednesday.
Along with its demands related to Israel and the Palestinians, the group says Hartzell — who has Gov. Greg Abbott's support — must resign. The group says it plans to hold another demonstration on Wednesday at noon, local time.
Northwestern and Brown reach agreements with protestors
This week Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and, as of Tuesday, Brown University in Rhode Island reached deals with student protesters to deescalate the demonstrations.
Brown President Christina Paxson shared details on the agreement in a campus-wide message on Tuesday.
"The devastation and loss of life in the Middle East has prompted many to call for meaningful change, while also raising real issues about how best to accomplish this," Paxson wrote. "Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog, debate and listening to each other."
Students of the Brown Divest Coalition set up an unauthorized encampment on the school's College Green on April 24, according to the university. With this new deal to deescalate protests, the students have agreed to end the encampment by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Additionally, they will refrain from any further actions "that would violate Brown's conduct code" through the end of the school year, including Commencement and Reunion Weekend.
In return, the school said it would invite five students to meet with five members of the Corporation of Brown University, the University's governing body that includes a Board of Trustees and a Board of Fellows, in May. The students will be allowed to hold a presentation on why Brown's endowment should divest from "companies enabling and profiting from the genocide in Gaza," the agreement stated.
Paxson said she will also ask the Advisory Committee on University Resources Management, the panel responsible for reviewing whether Brown's business and investment practices follow ethical and moral standards consistent with the school's goals and values, to provide a recommendation on divestment by Sept. 30, which will then be brought to the Corporation for a vote at its October meeting.
Dozens of tents set up by protesters at Northwestern in Evanston have been removed from the school's Deering Meadow, after a pro-Palestinian coalition agreed to a deal with school leaders on Monday.
Under the agreement, the Northwestern Divestment Coalition can continue to organize limited protests through at least June 1. Protesters who aren't affiliated with the school are also barred from participating.
In return, the school agreed to transparency measures around its investments, to give support to Middle Eastern and Muslim students, and to fund the "full cost of attendance for five Palestinian undergraduates" to attend the school for four years, along with two visiting Palestinian faculty for two years.
The university also said it will look to add more support for Jewish students. It called recent reports of antisemitic and anti-Muslim/Palestinian incidents "unacceptable."
The school said its goal was to "ensure that the violence and escalation we have seen elsewhere does not happen here at Northwestern."
Columbia and protesters hit a new impasse on Monday
While demonstrators elsewhere have reached deals with their schools' administrations, campus officials at Columbia have rejected student demands to divest from companies operating in Israel.
So, students entered Hamilton Hall early Tuesday morning, chained and barricaded its doors and have been using a rope system to get supplies from supporters, reported WKCR, the university radio station.
Outside, a crowd cheered as the facade was draped with signs reading "Intifada" and "Hind's Hall" — the latter a reference to Hind Rajab, a young Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza in January.
The university is now under what amounts to a lockdown of the campus in Manhattan's Morningside Heights, with access restricted to essential-service employees and students who live in residential halls on the campus.
"This building has now been liberated," an Instagram account affiliated with the student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest announced as it posted an image of Hamilton Hall, echoing language used during a 1968 protest.
Columbia students protesting racism against Black people and the Vietnam War were occupying Hamilton Hall and other buildings exactly 56 years ago — on April 30, 1968 — when police violently cleared the campus. More than 700 people were arrested and almost 150 people were injured.
The New York Police Department says it has officers stationed outside the university, but not on school grounds.
Tuesday's campus shutdown was mirrored by one at Barnard College, which is closely affiliated with Columbia.
Columbia's leadership has set several deadlines as it seeks to reach an agreement with demonstrators to end the encampment, as the school said it violates school policies and is a threat to campus safety, a disturbance to Jewish students and students trying to study and sleep.
Columbia seeks ways to hold graduation ceremony
Columbia's last day of classes for the spring semester was Monday, marking the start of "reading week," in which students traditionally prepare for looming final exams. Those exams are currently set to begin on Friday, with commencement planned for May 15.
Columbia President Minouche Shafik said on Monday that she wanted the protesters to "disperse voluntarily," urging them to consider that the graduating class of 2024 did not get to have their high school commencement ceremonies in person due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The president also said the school was prepared to allow demonstrations to resume after exams and commencement. But, Shafik added, protesters would need to submit an application at least two days in advance, and protests would be allowed only in designated areas.
Shafik said Columbia has supported protests and vigils that happened earlier in the year, as they were peaceful and didn't disturb campus operations.
But she added the encampment has caused an "unwelcoming environment" and "hostile environment" for Jewish students, and violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws discrimination at schools that receive federal funding.

Article: NEW YORK — (AP) — Large numbers of New York City police officers began entering the Columbia University late Tuesday as dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters remained on the campus.
Shortly before officers entered the campus, the New York Police Department received a notice from Columbia authorizing officers to take action, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to discuss details of the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
After entering the campus, a contingent of police officers approached Hamilton Hall, the administration building that students began occupying in the morning.
Students had defiantly set up tents again after police cleared an encampment at the university on April 18 and arrested more than 100 people. The students had been protesting on the Manhattan campus since the previous day, opposing Israeli military action in Gaza and demanding the school divest from companies they claim are profiting from the conflict.
Protests have spread to campuses from California to Massachusetts as May commencement ceremonies near, putting added pressure on schools to clear protesters.
More than 1,000 protesters have been arrested over the last two weeks on campuses in states including Texas, Utah, Virginia, North Carolina, New Mexico, Connecticut, Louisiana, California and New Jersey, some after violent clashes with police in riot gear.
“Walk away from this situation now and continue your advocacy through other means,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams advised the Columbia protesters on Tuesday afternoon. “This must end now.”
The White House condemned the standoffs at Columbia and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where protesters had occupied two buildings until officers with batons intervened overnight and arrested 25 people. Officials estimated the northern California campus' total damage to be upwards of $1 million.
President Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is “absolutely the wrong approach,” and “not an example of peaceful protest,” said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.
Other colleges have sought to negotiate agreements with the demonstrators in the hopes of having peaceful commencement ceremonies. As cease-fire negotiations appeared to gain steam, it wasn't clear whether those talks would inspire an easing of protests.
Northwestern University notched a rare win when officials said they reached a compromise with students and faculty who represent the majority of protesters on its campus near Chicago to allow peaceful demonstrations through the end of spring classes.
The nationwide campus protests began at Columbia in response to Israel’s offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.
Israel and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.
On Columbia's campus, protesters locked arms early Tuesday and carried furniture and metal barricades to Hamilton Hall, among several buildings that were occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest. Demonstrators called the building Hind's Hall, honoring a young girl who was killed in Gaza under Israeli fire.
The takeover came hours after protesters had shrugged off an earlier ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended — restricted from all academic and recreational spaces, allowed only to enter their residences, and, for seniors, ineligible to graduate.
Mahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator before talks with the administration broke down over the weekend, was among the suspended students. His suspension letter — which he shared with The Associated Press — said he had refused to leave the encampment after prior warnings, but Khalil said he had abided by the university’s demand to vacate the encampment on the campus lawn by the Monday afternoon deadline.
Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement that anyone occupying Hamilton Hall risked being expelled from the university for escalating the protest “to an untenable situation — vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows, and blockading entrances.”
Occupying protesters have insisted they will remain in Hamilton Hall until the university agrees to three demands — divestment, financial transparency and amnesty.
The Columbia University Chapter of the American Association of University Professors said faculty’s efforts to help defuse the situation have been repeatedly ignored by the university’s administration despite school statutes that require consultation. The group warned of potential conflict between police officers nearby and protesters on campus.
“We hold University leadership responsible for the disastrous lapses of judgment that have gotten us to this point,” the chapter said in a statement late Tuesday. “The University President, her senior staff, and the Board of Trustees will bear responsibility for any injuries that may occur during any police action on our campus.”
Ilana Lewkovitch, a self-described “leftist Zionist” student at Columbia, said it’s been hard to concentrate on school for weeks, amid calls for Zionists to die or leave campus. Her exams have been punctuated with chants of “say it loud, say it clear, we want Zionists out of here” in the background, she said.
Lewkovitch, who identifies as Jewish and studied at Columbia’s Tel Aviv campus, said she wished the current pro-Palestinian protests were more open to people like her who criticize Israel’s war policies but believe there should be an Israeli state.
Adams claimed Tuesday that the Columbia protests have been “co-opted by professional outside agitators.” The mayor didn’t provide specific evidence to back up that contention, which was disputed by protest organizers and participants.
NYPD officials made similar claims about “outside agitators” during the huge, grassroots demonstrations against racial injustice that erupted across the city after the death of George Floyd in 2020. In some instances, top police officials falsely labeled peaceful marches organized by well-known neighborhood activists as the work of violent extremists.

Article: Newswise — A new study has found that pancreatic cancer cells are different based on their location in the pancreas, providing new information about tumors that could lead to better targeted treatments.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer, and the diagnosis has dramatically increased over the last decade. It is currently the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women globally and projected to be the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths world-wide by 2030. This increase is due to several factors such as an increase in obesity and diabetes.
Houston Methodist’s section chief of gastrointestinal medical oncology, Dr. Maen Abdelrahim, served as first and concept generating author for the article titled, “Comparative molecular profiling of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the head versus body and tail,” published in NPJ Precision Oncology, an online journal in the Nature family of publications. The research team discovered that the anatomical location of the pancreatic tumor is a contributing factor for the outcomes of systematic therapy interventions.
Abdelrahim and his collaborators established a hypothesis that there is a difference in microenvironments of tumors in the pancreatic head versus the body and tail, particularly the immunotherapy receptors found on each section of the pancreas.
“By focusing on biology around the tumor and taking its location on the pancreas into account we can better evaluate our treatment options,” said Abdelrahim. “Rather than treating patients under the umbrella of pancreatic malignancy, a shift to a tumor location-based model can seriously alter how clinicians set up preliminary treatment plans.”
The team hopes this finding will help clinicians develop a more specific treatment plan and improve patient outcomes.
Abdelrahim’s collaborators on this study were Benjamine A. Weinberg, Adbullah Esmail, Anup Kasi, Nestor F. Esnaola, Joanne Xiu, and Yasmine Baca.

Article: LOS ANGELES — (AP) — At least 55 people were hurt, two seriously, when a Metro light rail train and a University of Southern California shuttle bus collided Tuesday along a busy thoroughfare in downtown Los Angeles, officials said.
The crash happened shortly before noon along Exposition Boulevard, near the USC campus and Natural History Museum, according to the LA Fire Department.
Two victims were hospitalized with serious injuries and 16 others were transported in fair condition, the department said. Another 37 people were treated at the scene.
Dave Sotero, a spokesperson for LA Metro, said the bus crossed into the path of an E Line train. The light rail line runs from East Los Angeles to downtown Santa Monica mostly along streets, and not all of the crossings have gates.
Genesis Hernandez was transferring from a Metro bus to catch the E Line to Santa Monica, where she attends college when “all of a sudden I just saw a bunch of ambulances going by,” she recalled.
The 19-year-old was able to view the crash scene from a platform at the Expo/Vermont Metro station. “The bus definitely got crunched on its front end,” she said. “The train didn't look too damaged.”
Television news footage showed the left side of the red and white bus smashed against the first car of the train. The front section of the bus had significant damage.
The Starcraft 40-passenger bus was traveling westbound on Exposition Boulevard with only the driver and one passenger aboard when the collision occurred, according to a statement from USC Transportation. The bus driver and passenger were the two most severely injured, according to fire department officials.
There were more than 150 passengers on the Santa Monica-bound Metro train, officials said.
Sotero said the Los Angeles Police Department would be in charge of the investigation.
“Metro offers its sympathy to those injured in the accident,” Sotero said in an email.
Exposition Boulevard was closed in both directions during the initial investigation. Metro said its train service would be limited and buses would be used to get passengers through the crash area.

Gov. Jim Pillen announces Brig. Gen. Craig Strong as his pick for adjutant general of the Nebraska National Guard on Friday, May 26, 2023, in Lincoln. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
LINCOLN — Approximately two dozen Nebraska National Guard members will be deployed to Elkhorn to assist with security as early as Wednesday, in the wake of last week’s tornado outbreak.
Gov. Jim Pillen on Tuesday announced that the Guard will assist with neighborhood security after a string of tornadoes ripped through Lancaster, Douglas and Washington Counties, particularly the communities of Waverly, Elkhorn and Bennington. Soldiers will assist with deterring looting and managing heavy vehicle traffic.

At this time, Douglas County officials have requested National Guard personnel only for Elkhorn, though additional requests could be made in the future.
Pillen signed an emergency proclamation Sunday allowing access to the Governor’s Emergency Fund to help communities in the three counties recover from storm damage.
Over the weekend the governor and Adj. Gen. Craig Strong, who oversees the Nebraska National Guard, toured parts of the storm path and witnessed the damage firsthand. At a Monday news conference, Pillen said he and Strong were assessing damages and had not reached a decision on Guard deployment.
“I don’t know that anybody can find the right words to use it, but it’s a war zone,” Pillen said. “The longer it (the tornado) went, the bigger it got and the wider it was.”
The National Weather Service estimated the tornado that hit Elkhorn in western Douglas County, before moving into Washington County, was an EF-3 tornado, with 165 mph peak wind, the highest wind in the EF-3 rating before being classified an EF-4.
The tornado was on the ground for nearly one hour and traveled 31.16 miles, crossing the Missouri River into Harrison County, Iowa. It had a maximum width of 1,600 yards, or 0.9 miles.
Pillen has said the Arbor Day storms destroyed about 450 Nebraska homes and that Nebraska remains in contact with federal partners, including FEMA, for additional assistance.

Article: Newswise — Interdisciplinary researchers in Illinois, the U.S. and around the world can advance their projects with the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology's new Zeiss Xradia 630 Versa micro-CT scanner, the first of its kind with life science applications in the U.S.
Computed tomography, or CT, is an imaging technique that involves capturing a series of cross-sectional X-ray scans of an object or sample — be it a material like concrete or a biological sample like an insect or human body. Stacked on top of one another, the images non-invasively reconstruct the subject in 3D from the inside out. Microscopic computed tomography, or micro-CT, helps researchers reconstruct subjects as tiny and delicate as collagen or insect antennae.
Most micro-CT scanners use only X-rays, which are invisible to the human eye, but Beckman’s new model also incorporates visible through a process called scintillation. The 630 Versa can also scan small subsections of large materials while maintaining a maximum imaging resolution of 40 nanometers, 2,500 times narrower than the width of a human hair.
“With building materials, hairline cracks are the start of where things go catastrophically wrong, and the micro-CT scanner at the Beckman Institute can see those cracks,” said Beckman microscopist T. Josek. “We’re providing the opportunity for researchers at the University of Illinois and beyond to start here and start small — see how a material behaves and what it looks like, and then scale up.”
Researchers can use the compression/tensile stage to stretch, bend and compress their samples while scrutinizing them up close — a technique called in situ mechanical testing. The Versa 630 can also do diffraction contrast tomography, a technique wherein researchers can determine a material’s grain orientation by tracking how X-rays bend as they pass through it.
The scanner was installed in January 2024 and is the first 630 model for life science applications in the U.S. In addition to the Beckman Institute, the Illinois Materials Research Laboratory, The Grainger College of Engineering and the Office for the Vice Chancellor of Research and Innovation committed funds to support its purchase.
The Beckman Microscopy Suite team is focused on finding projects on campus and beyond that might benefit from the Versa 630 and are providing comprehensive trainings for those new to the technology. Carl Zeiss Microscopy, the scanner’s manufacturer, is integral to these efforts.
"We at ZEISS are thrilled to be partnering with the Beckman Institute Microscopy Suite to deliver this flexible and intuitive system for X-ray microscopy," said Aubrey Funke, Carl Zeiss Microscopy Product Marketing Manager for Life Science EM/XRM. "The ability to image your sample, be it organic or material, becomes a less intimidating process on the ZEISS Xradia Versa 630. With high powered-resolution and expanded ease-of-use for all skill levels, the Versa 630 is ideal for diverse research capabilities across a spectrum of applications, including life science, electronics, materials research, and many more. We look forward to working with the Beckman Institute Microscopy Suite to support many diverse research projects.”
Researchers at the University of Illinois and beyond are encouraged to use the 630 Versa micro-CT scanner. For more information or to use the micro-CT scanner, please visit the Beckman Institute Microscopy Suite website at https://itg.beckman.illinois.edu/microscopy_suite.

Article: The Dallas Cowboys finally got a veteran contract done. Just not any of the ones who are truly pressing.
In the realm of unfinished business for the franchise, that's right about where Monday's one-year deal for running back Ezekiel Elliott registers. It's a blip on the priority scale, adding a modestly reliable deck chair to a ship that has spent the majority of the offseason sinking. And all of this in the backdrop of team owner Jerry Jones' now infamous "all in" proclamation. Precisely how "all in" have the Cowboys been? Well, let's survey.
The head coach, Mike McCarthy, is entering the final year of his contract. It's a season that will feature Jerry's buddy, Bill Belichick, vulturing from the sideline as he looks for a "win now" opportunity in 2025.
The franchise quarterback, Dak Prescott, has no contract extension in sight and is now subject to endless offseason debates about his level of importance to the team.
The top-five wideout, CeeDee Lamb, is seeing a steep price tag become more justifiable by the month, leading to a legitimate question about why the Cowboys didn’t push harder to extend his deal one year ago.
And the best defensive player on the team, Micah Parsons … re-read the above paragraph about Lamb and apply it to next offseason, when we’ll likely be asking why Dallas didn’t get Parsons' deal done one year earlier rather than one year later.
That’s a lot of unfinished business for Dallas, an assembly line of loose ends that easily dwarfs the looming problems of every other team in the NFL. And it’s coming in an offseason when the franchise’s talent has gotten worse.
The offensive line? Younger but not necessarily better.
The running backs? A rotation without a dynamic player.
The wideouts? Less depth.
The defense? Lost the best assistant coach on the staff in coordinator Dan Quinn and watched DeMarcus Lawrence get another year older.
Lest we forget, this all comes amid smaller headlines that should also convey concerns, like the fact that Parsons and Lamb skipped voluntary workouts at the team’s facility this offseason.
Piece it all together and it doesn't necessitate stepping back to understand the larger picture: The Cowboys are at a critical juncture in almost every imaginable way. The franchise could conceivably have a new head coach and new starting quarterback one year from now. Few NFL franchises find themselves in that kind of position and don't slip into some phase of a rebuild.
All of which makes it important that Dallas gets something — anything — of consequence done in the next few months. The top of the list will be Lamb’s extension, which is trending toward making him the highest paid wide receiver in the NFL for at least a short time. Next up will be finding some common ground with Prescott, although as of this week, there was no progress on any new contract with him. But knowing where Prescott stands would go a long way in shaping up a timeframe with Parsons, too. Particularly if Prescott appears destined to test free agency next offseason, which would all but assure he will depart Dallas.
Unquestionably, this is the biggest slate of unfinished business in the league. And the answers promise to shape the Cowboys for at least the next half decade.
As for the rest of the NFL, here are the biggest remaining storylines as we head toward the summer …
Multiple $50 million (plus) per season QB extensions are simmering
Prescott isn’t the only quarterback with an extension that needs to be hammered out. Four other key deals are hanging in the balance, including the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Trevor Lawrence, Detroit Lions’ Jared Goff, Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa, and Green Bay Packers’ Jordan Love. Here’s a snapshot of what is going on with each:
Lawrence's reps and the Jaguars are in talks. He had his fifth-year option picked up this week, officially giving the Jaguars control through the 2025 season, at which point they could begin utilizing franchise tags to keep him in the fold through at least 2027. That's not the plan. Lawrence has been reticent to push it publicly, but he and his representatives would like to get his deal done this offseason — as would the Jaguars. The numbers here will be key. There is no longer a presumption that Lawrence is a lock to sign a deal making him the highest paid player in the NFL, particularly after his injuries and struggles last season. It's worth noting that Lawrence has a league-worst 60 turnovers over the past three seasons. While those aren't all his fault, it's a troubling issue when focused through the context of his rollback in 2023. When you talk to contract evaluators on both the agent and team side, Lawrence appears to slot at the edge of the top five, with his extension somewhere in the neighborhood of the five-year, $255 million pact signed by Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts in 2023. That would put Lawrence's annual average value at $51 million, which is a sweet spot that factors in some projection of a higher ceiling still to come. One thing I want to make clear here: Not all agents are buying this. More than one agent shared the opinion that Lawrence's negotiation should begin with him setting a contract record at quarterback and work from there. That's largely due to his standing as the centerpiece of the franchise and the team's No. 1 overall draft pick in 2021. It's an interesting argument that might foreshadow some sticky negotiations. Whatever the case, if and when the deal gets done, the target is going to be July, prior to training camp.
Goff and the Lions are in talks, but nothing is particularly close at this point. This one is going to be interesting — to the point that it’s possible Goff plays out his deal in 2024 and the Lions apply the franchise tag to him in 2025. That being an option isn’t a signal Detroit is taking a soft approach to commitment. It’s more a matter of the two sides finding the right intersection that recognizes Goff’s success versus where he stacks up with other QBs inside the top 10 contracts at the position. One agent who has done multiple high-end deals, including at quarterback, pointed to the four-year $180 million deal Kirk Cousins signed with Atlanta as a starting point that would need a solid premium added that's reflective of Goff’s hand in last season’s NFC title game run. That premium should put Goff solidly north of Cousins and Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, tipping his average annual salary over the $50 million mark, with two full years of guaranteed money and a partial guarantee into Year 3 of the deal. If it’s less than that, Goff is giving the Lions a hometown discount.
Following the completion of the draft, Tagovailoa’s extension is now at the top of the priority list for the Dolphins. The heavy lifting hasn’t started in talks, but it’s expected to ramp up quickly. Contract evaluators believe the Cousins deal in Atlanta, plus a solid premium due to Tua’s age, provides a set of guardrails in negotiations. The question here will be the number of years and where the guarantees fall — as well as whether those guarantees stretch into a third year. It’s clear Miami is set on getting this one done by training camp. Like Goff, peg Tagovailoa’s deal as being in the neighborhood of $50 million-plus per season, reflecting the salary cap increasing at a higher than anticipated rate.
Due to the CBA’s contract guidelines, Love and the Packers aren’t actually eligible to sign an extension until Friday, due to the deal he signed last offseason not having been on the books for a full year yet and also having a slew of void years attached to it. Now that the draft is in the books and the calendar is turning to May, the two sides can run headlong into hammering an extension out. The floor on this one is going to be significant. With Love’s predecessor Aaron Rodgers departing with a final season salary north of $50 million, that number is expected to be the starting point for Love’s annual average value. You should be noticing a trend here with that $50-million-per-season shelf. If a quarterback is considered to be inside or near the top 10 in the league — or is young with modest success and high remaining upside — agents are aiming for that $50 million mark as a floor. Love will be no different. A franchise tag here isn’t out of the question, given that Love still has a limited track record of success. It should be noted that if a tag is used and Love’s second-half of 2023 materializes as his performance level in 2024, the next round of negotiations after 2024 will be for a deal that makes him the highest paid player in the NFL.
Winds of change in San Francisco
It didn’t happen before or during the NFL Draft, but you can see the setup coming for the 49ers: One of their top two wideouts isn’t likely to be on this team after the 2024 season.
With Brandon Aiyuk playing on his fifth-year option and Deebo Samuel nearing a manageable trapdoor exit in his contract next offseason, you can see where this is going. Particularly after San Francisco drafted wideout Ricky Pearsall in the first round and Jacob Cowing in the fourth last week. The question now becomes “who” between that pair of Aiyuk and Samuel.
Given the level of punishment Samuel has taken over the course of his career and Aiyuk being the younger player who is now ascending into his prime, Samuel would appear to be the player who is made available next offseason … or potentially even into training camp. It's something to keep an eye on in the interim: Whether Aiyuk reports for mandatory minicamp in June, which could foreshadow a holdout (or hold in) during training camp.
A pair of wideout holdouts?
Like Aiyuk, eyes will be on Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson and Cincinnati Bengals wideout Tee Higgins. Jefferson is awaiting a monster contract extension that a few people inside the franchise believe should have been a bigger priority (and also gotten done) last offseason. One year later, the numbers have moved into the territory of Jefferson becoming the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history. That expectation didn’t lessen after the draft, with the Vikings needing their best offensive weapon on the field to help along the development of rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy. If there’s not progress on getting this deal done, it would not be a surprise to see Jefferson skip the team’s mandatory minicamp and then engage in a hold-in come training camp.
Higgins, on the other hand, didn’t have anything close to what his camp believed was a suitable contract extension offer prior to the Bengals applying the franchise tag to him. That makes it far less likely that even some significant holdout pressure could result in a deal getting done. If anything, a holdout by Higgins in mandatory minicamp and into training camp would be geared toward forcing a trade. Right now, the Bengals don’t have plans to make that kind of move. That means either Higgins shows up and plays out the tag, or digs in and creates enough of a scene to force a trade that appears very unlikely.
The Rashee Rice suspension
Rice will eventually be suspended by the NFL for a violation of the personal conduct policy, triggered by his road racing crash in Dallas earlier this offseason. That is not in dispute. The question is what the length of suspension will be and when it will happen. And that is entirely in the hands of the legal process.
Rice is facing eight felony counts related to the incident — one count of collision involving serious bodily injury, one count of aggravated assault, and six counts of collision involving injury. Of the eight counts, the most serious from a legal standing, is the charge tied to aggravated assault.
The presumption is that Rice’s legal team will eventually seek a plea deal that could ultimately be aided by any compensation he provides to the crash victims. The important part to understand here is that the legal process is just getting underway and could take months if not longer to snake toward some manner of trial. Delays in that process, which also always come into play, could push a resolution all the way into 2025.
That means Rice may not face any NFL discipline this season.
That said, it’s coming down the pipeline, with the measure of severity expected to be impacted by whatever comes out of the legal process and any measures that Rice and his legal team use to resolve his charges.

Several Utah representatives introduced legislation last week to withdraw a proposed rule from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that the agency says would promote conservation through the protection and restoration of certain landscapes, but that opponents say would stop state-level management of public lands and block land from important uses.
Reps. John Curtis, Celeste Maloy, Blake Moore and Burgess Owens and nine other members of Congress’ Western Caucus sponsored legislation to withdraw the rule, alleging it would limit access to public lands. The rule, titled “Conservation and Landscape Health,” was introduced in March and purportedly “lays groundwork for conserving wildlife habitat, restoring places impacted by wildfire and drought, expanding outdoor recreation, and thoughtful development,” according to an Interior Department press release.
Gov. Spencer Cox and several other governors have said they plan to sue the federal government over the new rule.
The sponsors of last week’s legislation said the BLM’s rule would have a disproportionate effect on Western states and citizens, as more than 90 percent of the 245 million acres controlled by the BLM are located in the West.
Curtis spoke about the bill on the House floor, where he spoke about Utah’s rural communities, and how they “work hard to feed our families, protect American energy, and lead in manufacturing.”
“We should be making it easier for them,” he continued. “Instead, the Biden administration is pushing this rule to allow environmental groups funded by Swiss billionaires who pretend to be representing Utah to lock up public lands. This is completely backwards… .”
Curtis said the new rule favors “wealthy individuals and environmental groups, allowing them to lock up land that belongs to all Utahns. I am pleased that the House voted in a bipartisan manner to pass my bill revoking its implementation.”
The rule proposes a number of regulations under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), including allowing environmental groups to lease land to close it off to other uses.
“The proposal is consistent with strategies used by other state and federal land management agencies to ensure the federal government has tools and direction to identify areas in need of restoration or conservation, as well as the ability to encourage investments in public lands to help balance the impacts of development,” the Interior Department press release states.
Although the release also claimed the rule would “increase access to outdoor education by putting conservation on equal footing with other uses,” the Western Caucus sponsors claimed it would actually limit recreational opportunities, as well as hinder access for energy and mineral development, grazing and forest management.
“In the West, we know locking up lands with preservationist designations does not automatically guarantee healthy landscapes. In fact, the opposite is often the case,” said Western Caucus Chairman Dan Newhouse. “Farmers and ranchers are the best stewards of the land, not bureaucrats in Washington who seek to hamper our land managers’ ability to conserve the land they rely on for their livelihoods.”

Article: If you were curious about what exactly happened to Shohei Ohtani's money after it was allegedly stolen by his former interpreter Ippei Mizuhara, a new report from ESPN's Tisha Thompson has shed new light on the situation.
The man at the center of the alleged illegal gambling ring that received Ohtani's money was run by a man named Mathew Bowyer, who has been under investigation by federal authorities since last year. Ohtani was only roped into the scandal when authorities noticed his bank information among the payments to Bowyer.
Mizuhara reportedly funneled weekly $500,000 payments from Ohtani's bank account to an associate of Bowyer's to cover his illegal gambling losses. ESPN reports that associate would then deposit the money into accounts with Resorts World, a Las Vegas casino opened in 2021, and Pechanga Resort Casinoi in Temecula, Calif.
Bowyer and the associate would then allegedly convert the money to playing chips, gamble with it and cash out if they won. Bowyer reportedly lost $7.9 million at Resorts World from June 22 to Oct. 2023, a span of time in which he was receiving money from Mizuhara.
This is all apparently part of a much larger trend in the gambling world, where illegal bookies in Southern California use Las Vegas casinos to launder the money. Twelve people have reportedly been charged and convicted while two Vegas casinos have agreed to pay fines.
There's even a tangential connection to LeBron James. The Los Angeles Lakers star's friend and business partner Maverick Carter reportedly admitted late last year that he bet on NBA games via an illegal bookie. ESPN reports that bookie, Wayne Nix, has since pleaded guilty to operating an illegal gambling business and filing a false tax return. NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen and former MLB star Yasiel Puig also reportedly made bets through Nix.
In the case of Bowyer, he reportedly boasted more than 600 bettors and was known as a whale in Vegas, with a reputation for bringing between $250,000 and $1 million with him as often as two or three times a month.
Where does the Shohei Ohtani scandal currently stand?
As far as Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers and MLB, the Ippei Mizuhara situation is in the rear-view mirror.
Mizuhara turned himself in on a federal charge of bank fraud earlier this month and is currently out on $25,000 bond. His attorney released a statement soon after indicating a desire to cut a deal with prosecutors rather than go to trial, where he would face up to 30 years in prison:
Today Mr. Mizuhara voluntarily surrendered, made his initial appearance, and was released on bond as agreed to with the government. He is continuing to cooperate with the legal process and is hopeful that he can reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.
He wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family. As noted in court, he is also eager to seek treatment for his gambling. We have no further comment at this time, but Mr. Mizuhara will be providing further comment as the legal process proceeds.
To date, no reports of a deal have materialized, but that doesn't mean negotiations aren't happening.
Meanwhile, MLB has released a statement recognizing that authorities see Ohtani as a victim, leaving them little to investigate.
This is about as good an outcome that Ohtani and his people could have hoped for after his name popped up on an illegal bookie's ledger, but remains a very sad situation. It's become clear that Mizuhara was both very close to Ohtani and suffered from enormous issues with gambling addiction.
Now, Ohtani is just focusing on baseball again, while Mizuhara is sorting out an unenviable legal situation.

Article: 7-DAY DEADLINE ALERT: The Schall Law Firm Encourages Investors in iRobot Corporation with Losses of $100,000 to Contact the Firm
LOS ANGELES, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Schall Law Firm, a national shareholder rights litigation firm, reminds investors of a class action lawsuit against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) for violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Investors who purchased the Company’s securities between August 5, 2022 and January 26, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), are encouraged to contact the firm before May 7, 2024.
If you are a shareholder who suffered a loss, click here to participate.
We also encourage you to contact Brian Schall of the Schall Law Firm, 2049 Century Park East, Suite 2460, Los Angeles, CA 90067, at 310-301-3335, to discuss your rights free of charge. You can also reach us through the firm's website at www.schallfirm.com, or by email at bschall@schallfirm.com.
The class, in this case, has not yet been certified, and until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.
According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. iRobot’s merger with Amazon (“the Merger”) would give Amazon a dominant position in robot vacuum cleaners (“RVCs”), making it unlikely that American and European authorities would approve it. The Company failed to complete adequate due diligence on the Merger and ignored regulatory risks. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about iRobot, investors suffered damages.
Join the case to recover your losses.
The Schall Law Firm represents investors around the world and specializes in securities class action lawsuits and shareholder rights litigation.

Matt Harmon and Andy Behrens go where no pod has gone before after the NFL Draft. They identify the biggest winners and losers in the fantasy world. This is totally an original idea so don't fact check us. Behrens also reveals the four biggest debates he had when putting together his rookie dynasty rankings.
To start the show, Behrens shares his thoughts on the Bears dynamic draft that saw them snag Caleb Williams and Rome Odunze in the first and the Iowa punter in the fourth round. Being a Hawkeye alum, Behrens is over the moon with the Bears selections and is counting down the days to a Super Bowl parade.
The two then share, secret list style, their three biggest winners and losers from this year's NFL Draft with a focus on players that will now have to face competition from rookie teammates and those are look like they are in the clear for tons of volume. Both agree Las Vegas Raiders RB Zamir White might be the biggest winner of the draft while his new teammate Brock Bowers might be the biggest loser.
To end the show, Behrens shares the four biggest debates he had with himself when putting together his rookie dynasty rankings. Harmon and Behrens discuss the biggest hot button debates that will dominate dynasty rookie drafts this summer.

Article: Newswise — The border crossing separating San Diego, California, from Tijuana, Mexico, is a dynamic place. When it was closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, drug tourism from San Diego to Tijuana continued. This provided a flow of people in both directions, bringing with them not only the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) but also the virus that causes AIDS (HIV). A collaborative study led by researchers from University of California San Diego and Irvine, recently published in the Lancet, found that rather than preventing the spread of disease, closing the border actually increased the rate of HIV transmission.
Injection drug use increases the risk of HIV infection through the sharing of injection equipment. To investigate the dynamics between border closure, drug use and HIV transmission, Britt Skaathun, Ph.D., adjunct assistant professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine, and first author on the paper, led an effort that studied 618 participants from October 2020 to October 2021, focusing on three different groups: people who live in San Diego who cross the border to use drugs in Tijuana; people who live in San Diego and use drugs in San Diego; and people who live in Tijuana and use drugs in Tijuana.
Subjects first underwent interviews, answering questions about their demographics, drug use behaviors, sexual behaviors, sexual identity and border crossing behaviors. Every six months they gave blood samples and were tested for HIV and hepatitis C.
Tetyana Vasylyeva, D.Phil., assistant professor of population health and disease prevention at UC Irvine, and senior author on the study, analyzed the spread of HIV through the virus genetic data. Combining molecular epidemiology with the questionnaire answers, the scientists found that people were crossing the border in both directions and being exposed to HIV despite government efforts to keep the border closed. The scientists then deepened their analysis by applying advanced molecular techniques.
For every patient who tested HIV positive, Vasylyeva and her colleagues isolated the virus, sequenced its RNA and analyzed the genetic diversity in the border region. They investigated how closely the viruses were related genetically—a field of study called phylogenetics, in which scientists construct trees representing how viruses relate to each other.
After constructing viral phylogenetic trees, the scientists subjected them to a molecular clock analysis. Molecular clock is based on a theory that assumes organisms evolve with a relatively constant rate over time. In this case, applying the molecular clock to the phylogenetic trees enabled the scientists to estimate the timing of cross-border HIV transmission. That further enabled them to identify transmission clusters. “If two or three people have viruses that are very similar to each other, we can assume that the transmission event happened more recently, because there is not enough evolution between these different viruses from these different people,” explained Vasylyeva.
The next step was to combine the survey data and the phylodynamic data. They found that during the 18-month period of their study, nine people contracted HIV, mostly during the pandemic. “Nine sounds like a small number, but it's actually quite a lot of people because in the U.S., HIV incidence is relatively low. We were surprised to see this change in HIV status in such a short amount of time and wanted to look more closely at these clusters,” said Skaathun.
Applying a molecular clock to the clusters, they found a surprise: all of the new clusters had sequences from participants on both sides of the border, indicating that cross-border transmission was happening right when the border was closed. One cluster that grew despite the border closure included two people from San Diego that used drugs in Tijuana. “This shows that efforts to build a higher wall or policies to stop immigration will not mitigate HIV spread,” said Vasylyeva.
Structural risk is a social factor that increases harm. Skaathun says the current study shows that closing the border during the pandemic functioned as a structural risk factor. “The Frontera [border] is one integrated community that is not defined by place of residence. Efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S. also need to be integrated by extending to Tijuana,” she said.
In 2000, the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission was founded to “provide international leadership to improve health and quality of life along the U.S.-Mexico border.” Gudelia Rangel, Ph.D., serves as executive secretary for the commission. Rangel is also a co-author on the current study. “These findings confirm that HIV has no passport,” she says. Like her colleagues, she believes that establishing programs to eliminate HIV transmission at the border, such as harm reduction and substance use treatment services, is a more effective way of preventing viral spread than attempting to close a porous border.

Article: The Chicago area is likely going to escape the brunt of a system bringing strong-to-severe thunderstorms to the Great Plains on Tuesday, but pockets of gusty winds could cause tree damage, according to the National Weather Service.
That system has already sparked tornado watches in parts of Iowa and Missouri, with gusty winds and heavy rain also possible with those storms as they push toward the southeast.
As the midnight hour approaches, that system is expected to approach the Chicago area, but the storms are expected to dissipate, leaving only a chance for scattered showers if any precipitation does fall.
The threat of wind will still be present however, with wind gusts of 30-to-40 miles per hour possible overnight, according to NWS officials. “Isolated corridors” of high winds could also occur, with some gusts even exceeding 50 miles per hour.
Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.
Wind gusts of that speed have the potential to cause damage to trees and to power lines, with officials warning residents to be wary of the changing conditions between midnight and 4 a.m.
Breezy conditions are expected to persist in the area for several days, but conditions are expected to remain mostly dry on Wednesday and for most of Thursday, with several chances of rain impacting the area as the weekend approaches.
Stay tuned to the NBC 5 Storm Team for all the latest weather news and information.

Article: The first ever TV adaptation of C. J. Samson’s acclaimed "Shardlake" novels, starring Arthur Hughes as Tudor detective Matthew Shardlake, drops on Hulu from May 1. The four-part mini series centers around a gruesome murder at a monastery.
Out of the country when "Shardlake" season 1 debuts? Our guide below explains how to watch "Shardlake" online from anywhere with the help of a VPN.
Based on “Dissolution,” the first entry in Samson’s “Shardlake” saga, this brooding series introduces us to the hunchbacked-lawyer-turned-detective, who finds himself hired by Thomas Cromwell (Sean Bean) to solve a shocking murder.
Against the historic backdrop of Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries, the commissioner dispatched to St Donatus the Ascendent has been found dead – beheaded! It’s imperative that Shardlake, aided by Cromwell’s loyal henchman Jack (Anthony Boyle), expose the culprit and finish the commissioner’s job.
Adapted by Stephen Butchard (“The Last Kingdom”) and directed by Justin Chadwick (“The Other Boleyn Girl”), “Shardlake” promises to be a slam-dunk for murder-mystery fans. Not only does it boast an incredible cast, including “Game of Thrones” alumni Sean Bean as the ill-fated Cromwell and Paul Kaye as Brother Jerome, but it’s vividly evocative of the period.

Article: Newswise — LOS ANGELES (April 30, 2024) -- Artificial intelligence experts at Cedars-Sinai and the Smidt Heart Institute created a dataset with more than 1 million echocardiograms, or cardiac ultrasound videos, and their corresponding clinical interpretations. Using this database, they created EchoCLIP, a powerful machine learning algorithm that can “interpret” echocardiogram images and assess key findings.
The design and evaluation of EchoCLIP, described in a manuscript published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine, suggest that an EchoCLIP interpretation of a patient’s echocardiogram provides clinician-level evaluations of heart function, assessment of past surgeries and devices, and may assist clinicians in identifying patients in need of treatment. The EchoCLIP foundation model also can identify the same patient across multiple videos, studies and timepoints as well as recognize clinically important changes in a patient’s heart.
“To our knowledge, this is the largest model trained on echocardiography images,” said corresponding author David Ouyang, MD, a faculty member in the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute and in the Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine. “Many previous AI models for echocardiograms are only trained on tens of thousands of examples. In contrast, EchoCLIP’s uniquely strong performance in image interpretation is a result of its training on almost tenfold more data than existing models.”
“Our results suggest that large datasets of medical imaging and expert-adjudicated interpretations can serve as the basis for training medical foundation models, which are a form of generative artificial intelligence,” Ouyang said. He said this advanced foundation model can soon help cardiologists in the assessment of echocardiograms by generating preliminary assessments of cardiac measurements, identify changes that happen over time, and common disease states.
The team of investigators built a dataset of 1,032,975 cardiac ultrasound videos and corresponding expert interpretations to develop EchoCLIP. Key takeaways from the study include:
- EchoCLIP displayed strong performance when assessing cardiac function using heart images.
- The foundation model could identify implanted intracardiac devices like a pacemaker, implanted mitral valve repairs and aortic valves from the echocardiogram images.
- EchoCLIP accurately identified unique patients across studies, identified clinically important changes such as having undergone heart surgery, and enabled the development of a preliminary text interpretation of echocardiogram images.
“Foundation models are one of the newest areas within generative AI, but most models do not have enough medical data to be useful in the healthcare arena,” said Christine M. Albert, MD, MPH, chair of the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute and the Lee and Harold Kapelovitz Distinguished Chair in Cardiology.
Albert, who was not involved in the Nature Medicine study, said, “This novel foundation model integrates computer vision interpretation of echocardiogram images with natural language processing to augment cardiologists’ interpretation of echocardiograms.”
Cedars-Sinai investigator and first author Kai Christensen was also involved in the study. Other authors involved in the research include Milos Vukadinovic and Neal Yuan.
Ouyang is funded by NIH NHLBI grant R00HL157421.

Article: Jack Flaherty had a perfect start against his former team on Tuesday afternoon.
The Detroit Tigers pitcher matched an American League Record at Comerica Park when he recorded seven straight strikeouts to open their game against the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday.
By the time Flaherty was pulled from the mound in the seventh inning, he had a career-high 14 strikeouts. That matched Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow for the most thrown in a single game in the league this season, and the most thrown by a Tigers starter in a game in nearly a decade.
Only four other American League pitchers have struck out seven batters in a row to open a game. Luis Castillo was the most recent pitcher to pull that off in 2022. Miami Marlins pitcher Pablo Lopez holds the league record with nine.
"It was nice to come out and be in sync from pitch one," Flaherty said, via The Associated Press.
Despite Flaherty’s career day, the Cardinals rallied in the ninth behind RBIs from Alec Burleson and Pedro Pagés to pick up the 2-1 win.
Flaherty signed a one-year, $14 million deal with the Tigers this past offseason after spending most of his career with the Cardinals — who selected him in the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft. He made his debut with the club in 2017, and spent more than six seasons there before he was dealt to the Baltimore Orioles there. He went 8-9 with a 4.99 ERA in 27 starts last season.
The 28-year-old has yet to pick up a win in his six starts with the Tigers, but he has 50 strikeouts and five walks over 36 innings on the mound.
"He was on, and it was nasty," Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said, via The Associated Press. "He had his stuff."
The loss dropped the Tigers to 16-13 on the season, and marked their third loss in their last five outings. The Tigers and Cardinals, who ran it back immediately on Tuesday for a doubleheader after Monday’s contest was postponed, will wrap up their three-game series on Wednesday afternoon.

Rep. Shri Thanedar's campaign is alleging one of his most significant primary challengers failed to submit enough valid petition signatures to appear on the Democratic primary ballot for Michigan's 13th Congressional District this August.
In a news release sent Tuesday evening, the Democratic congressman from Detroit's reelection campaign says it's challenging the petition signatures submitted by Adam Hollier, a former state senator who finished second to Thanedar in the Aug. 2022 primary for the 13th District. Hollier, however, told the Free Press Thanedar is attempting to disenfranchise voters and is using "legal tricks" to keep him off the ballot.
Thanedar's campaign says it's challenging 791 of the approximately 1,555 signatures submitted by Hollier's campaign. It alleges several reasons why the signatures shouldn't be accepted, including potential duplicate signatures, signatures from voters registered outside the 13th District, signatures from people not registered to vote or registered at wrong addresses and potentially forged signatures.
"Some of the signatures, the handwriting, look like just one person doing it all," Thanedar said in a Tuesday interview. "It just looks, in general, like the quality of the work seems questionable."
Longtime Michigan political consultant Mark Grebner reviewed the signatures at Thanedar's request, according to an affidavit submitted by his campaign.
Thanedar's campaign says it's asked the Wayne County Clerk's office to investigate the signatures. Ultimately, it's the Board of State Canvassers that will determine who appears on the August primary ballot.
If the signature challenge is unsuccessful and Hollier ends up on the primary ballot, Thanedar said "(w)e'll be happy to engage and show the voters the work that I have done in the job for nearly a year and a half now."
The 13th District covers part of Detroit, several Downriver communities and most of the Grosse Pointe communities. Its heavily Democratic lean makes the primary extremely competitive.
Hollier is one of four primary challengers vying to oust Thanedar after a single term, in a field that also includes Detroit City Councilwoman Mary Waters. He received the second-most votes among five Democratic candidates in the 2022 primary, receiving nearly 3,800, or almost 5%, fewer votes than Thanedar.
He's touted several notable endorsements, including from Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and former U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, among others. Hollier said he ultimately believes he will end up on the primary ballot, despite Thanedar's challenge.
"I think Detroiters and people in the 13th Congressional District should be deeply frustrated that their Congressmember is trying to disenfranchise their ability to vote," Hollier said.
Along with Hollier and Waters, attorney Shakira Lynn Hawkins is running in the Democratic primary to challenge Thanedar, according to the Secretary of State's office.

Article: One of only two World Tour races in Germany, the Eschborn-Frankfurt is sticking to the course used last year set over more than 200km with two climbs of the Feldberg and three of the Mammolshainer Stich. It is officially the final classic race of the Spring so read on and we'll show you how to watch Eschborn-Frankfurt 2024 live streams from anywhere with a VPN, and potentially for FREE.
The 61st edition of this classic German race is held in and to the north west of Frankfurt. It compromises multiple laps of a series of loops around the outskirts of the city. Dominated by two climbs, the first of which is the 11km Feldberg, set on an average gradient of 4.8%, and that is followed 50km later by twin ascents of the shorter but much steeper 2.3km Mammolshain climb.
After, this the race returns once more to the slopes of the Feldberg before a final ascent of the Mammolshain some 40km from the finish line. This large distance to the end should allow gapped riders to re-join the front of the race and form a small group to fight out a sprint finish.
The key protagonists this year are going to be March Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates), Maximilian Schachmann and Emil Herzog both (BORA - hansgrohe), Mathias Vacek (Lidl - Trek) and Laurenz Rex (Intermarché - Wanty).

Article: BUFFALO, N.Y. — (AP) — Democratic state Sen. Timothy Kennedy won a special election Tuesday for the New York congressional seat vacated by Democrat Brian Higgins.
Kennedy defeated Republican Gary Dickson for the upstate New York seat, helped by a 2-to-1 Democratic registration advantage in the district, which includes Buffalo, Niagara Falls and several suburbs.
Kennedy has been in the state Senate since 2011. Describing Washington as "chaotic and dysfunctional," he said he would focus in Congress on reproductive rights, immigration and stronger gun laws like those passed in New York after a 2022 mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket.
“New York has been a bulwark against Donald Trump’s extremist MAGA agenda that has infected our politics and our nation’s capital,” he said during the campaign. “The MAGA extremists have made the House of Representatives a laughingstock.”
Registration wasn't Kennedy's only advantage. The Democrat raised $1.7 million as of April 10, compared with Dickson's $35,430 total, according to campaign finance reports. Kennedy spent just over $1 million in the off-season election, compared with $21,000 for Dickson as the candidates worked to remind voters to go to the polls.
Kennedy will serve in Congress for the rest of the year. He is on the ballot, along with Republican attorney Anthony Marecki, for the general election. On Tuesday, former town supervisor Nate McMurray, who planned to challenge Kennedy in a Democratic primary in June, said in a social media post that elections officials had removed him from the ballot because of insufficient signatures.
Earlier this year, the GOP's slim House majority was narrowed in a closely contested Long Island-area special election that followed New York Republican George Santos' expulsion from Congress. That race, won by Democrat Tom Suozzi, was viewed as a test of the parties' general election strategies on immigration and abortion.
Dickson, a retired FBI special agent, acknowledged the challenges of running in the upstate district when he announced his candidacy at the end of February, saying he was in the race to give voters a choice. He said he supports Trump as the Republican nominee for president, while describing his own politics as “more towards the center.”

Article: Apr. 30—Ector County ISD's Special Services Department is facing a lot of challenges from trying to clear up a backlog of referrals to the way it handles discipline.
At a recent ECISD Board of Trustees workshop, the board discussed discipline for multi-racial special education students. This is called significant disproportionality. Mark Gabrylczyk, executive director of special services, said they went over the risk ratio for discipline of a population of ECISD students compared to other students in the district.
When a district goes over the risk ratio, the state tells them they are being flagged for a disproportionality issue. The district has three years to fix it. If a district has three continual years of significant disproportionality, which ECISD has, the state puts the program in Targeted Assistance.
Gabrylczyk now has a meeting with the Texas Education Agency once a month to talk about how they are going to improve the risk ratio within that group of students. TEA had Gabrylczyk put together a plan that includes professional development for administrators and teachers where certain milestones have to be met.
"In addition, there's a financial element to it. The state is going to take 15 percent of the special education budget and it is now being allotted to fixing the issue of significant disproportionality. So 15 percent of the special education budget is significant in our case because it's close to $1 million. That $1 million needs to be spent on fixing that issue instead of being reinvested into another strategy or project that we need to tackle. So it's a big deal," he added.
The special education budget is about $6 million and it is separate from the general fund. It is made up of state and federal funds, which is "very controlled by the state, which is very controlled by the federal government," Gabrylczyk said. They have to use all 15 percent to fix the risk ratio.
He added that special education is very regulated and it's a complex part of the district.
"Because you're dealing with legal issues, you're dealing with financial issues, you're dealing with programming issues, you're dealing with eligibility issues. On top of that, you're dealing with kids who may have a learning disability to kids who are medically fragile," Gabrylczyk said.
Special Services also faces a backlog of evaluations. Gabrylczyk said they started the year with a carryover of 706 evaluations from last year. That didn't include any new evaluations that they were getting for this school year.
"This school year ... to date, we have received 726 new referrals. When we combine the carryover with the new referrals, we're sitting at over 1,400 referrals that we need to get done," Gabrylczyk said.
They have 570 referrals that had been completed and 436 referrals that are currently being evaluated. That means that the diagnostician, licensed specialist in school psychology, or the speech pathologist has the file folder and they've started the evaluation process, he said.
They have 900 of the 1,400 evaluations done. They have 21 diagnosticians, some of whom work virtually for the district, the others work on ECISD campuses. They have one licensed specialist in school psychology currently,
"Yes, we've done a lot of work in this area, but we still have a lot of work to do," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that the evaluation process takes a long time.
"When we receive a referral, we have 15 days to determine whether or not we're going to evaluate a student. If we decide to evaluate the student, we move forward with the evaluation and getting the consent signed to evaluate the student. If we decide not to evaluate the student, we inform the parents that we're not going to evaluate the student. So there's a 15-day window that we have for parents," Gabrylczyk said.
Special Education Supervisor Amanda Napolean said when a parent requests an evaluation, they have 15 school days to offer consent or decline to evaluate.
They have 45 school days to complete the evaluation and get the report written. They have 30 calendar days to meet on the results of the evaluation, Napolean said.
Gabrylczyk said they will be conducting evaluations over the summer. Napolean said they did them over spring break. The office was open for nine days, including weekends.
The state recently changed eligibility requirements for special education in the area of dyslexia, behavior and autism.
"It's a huge increase to what has been done in the past, not only in our school district but also throughout of the state of Texas," Gabrylczyk said.
Special Services has a process it uses to determine if students are eligible for special education.
"For example we will look at attendance, does the student have attendance issues? What are the student's academic strengths and what are their academic concerns? This is where the teacher will provide us information," Gabrylczyk said.
"We look at their MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) scores, which is really, really important. We look at their STAAR results, which is really, really important. We also look at their basic reading, math, spelling and writing scores on assessments that we give our kids. Are they weak or are they really strong?" he added.
They use a scale of 1 to 4 with 4 being the strongest and one the weakest.
"We look at for an example if the student is bilingual, or multilingual, we look at their TELPAS scores. We want to make sure that we're making consideration for both English and the Spanish language. We look at their vision screens. We look at their hearing screens. If it's a student who needs physical therapy or occupational therapy, we will go ahead and look at that," Gabrylczyk said.
"In the areas of speech, we look at their language fluency, their articulation, and also their voice," he added.
Schools use Mult-tiered Systems of Support. This replaced Response to Intervention, which focused on a student's academics.
The Multi-tiered Systems of Support looks at the whole child, including academics and behavior.
"What we also do is we look at the behavior of the kid; we look at the grade level of the students, and then we take all of this information ... and it goes to what we call a referral committee. Amanda (Napolean) sits on the referral committee," Gabrylczyk said.
Napolean said the referral committee includes the two lead diagnosticians, the two lead speech therapists, Napolean and another special services supervisor.
Napolean said she was previously a diagnostician and the other lead special education supervisor was previously a school psychologist.
The six review committee members review every file that comes in from campuses and parent requests. They take the information and make a recommendation of where to start the evaluation. If the data supports a possible learning disability, the information will be funneled down that path. If it supports autism, the information will be funneled down that path.
"From there, then we distribute them out to the evaluators to get consent and get rolling on the evaluation as quickly as possible," Napolean said.
What makes them decline to move forward with an evaluation is when, for example, a parent says their child was commended on the STAAR test last year and they just approached this year and the parent is worried about a disability, Napolean said.
When she looks through the data, Napolean said she can see that the data does not support a disability.
"It's in those those instances where ... it looks more of like a fluke than a pattern.That's what we're looking for is that true incidence of disability because that is something we take very seriously. It's a label that stays with a child forever. Anytime we see potentially that there is a disability, we will absolutely investigate to make sure," Napolean said.
Gabrylczyk said the law gives the special services department the opportunity to say they are going to evaluate a student, or they're not.
"That's why I think school districts throughout the state of Texas are really struggling, is because we have many of those types of situations," he added.
Napolean said when a student is declined, the department has to produce a notice of refusal.
"In that prior written notice, we have to outline the reason we are not accepting the request and that is exactly what we do. We say STAAR scores were this; MAP scores were this. In comparison to grade level peers, this student is not functioning below level and so we outline that very clearly and we send that to the parent. But yes, that takes a lot of time and effort as well," she added.
Parents and teachers can refer students to special services.
Napolean said teachers referring is the preferred way.
"When I say preferred, I'm not discounting anything that a parent would do. But when we get teacher requests for evaluations, we get a lot of data from the campus where they have compiled efforts of different strategies that they've tried and so as an assessor, when I get a referral that shows that they tried to teach it this way, realized the student didn't get it; tried to teach it this way, realized the student didn't get it. That is great data for me," Napolean said.
"As I start to evaluate, it helps me determine which battery would be a good measure for that student. It also tells me that it's not a knee jerk reaction ... They have tried some things first, and so it allows me as the evaluator to include that information in my report. There is a path to eligibility in the state of Texas that is lack of response to intervention. That is data in my report that I can include that says, we have formally evaluated but we also have evidence of lack of response to intervention and we feel this student needs additional supports. When I have a teacher request versus a parent request, I get all of that data and it helps me get to the bottom of that student's learning difficulties," she added.
Gabrylczyk noted that a lot of things happen in students' lives that may throw them off their academic progress.
"We know that kids have significant challenges in life, so when we see a student that, again, is doing really well, and they're scoring and then all of a sudden we see this difference. It is a concern and we take those concerns very seriously. But on the other hand, we also do have students who do have legitimate learning disabilities, and we want to do whatever we can to help them be successful in school. That's the thing about special education. Special education isn't a placement. It's a service that we provide and we all need to remember that all students are general education students first, with special education as a service, not a placement," he added.
Gabrylczyk said things have really changed over the years.
"There's been tons of court cases that went up to the Supreme Court that have really established precedents in what we do and how we do things and school systems in the area of special education. It's a very complex program in dealing with some of the situations that we deal with," he added.
Special Services serves 4,134 students and that figure is increasing.
"It's climbing because what we're seeing is about 80% of those referrals that we receive are kids going into special education and that's alarming. People always ask, why is that? Why is that happening? Nobody really has an answer and I wouldn't even feel comfortable addressing it," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that when a student is referred for special education and the decision is made to evaluate that student, that student is afforded specific protections under Section 504 of the ADA law. What those protections are, for an example, the student needs to be receiving accommodations, the students need to be receiving modifications. Even though the student hasn't qualified for special ed services yet there are protections that still need to happen with the student. What we tell our schools is this, you have a referral and yes, we're going to evaluate the student, but you need to have a plan moving forward and how you're going to accommodate and modify for this particular student," Gabrylczyk said.
The Texas Education Agency website says, "Section 504 requires that school districts provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to qualified students in their jurisdictions who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities."
"People always wonder what percentage of students should be what we determine is eligible for special ed services in school districts. Usually that number is between 10 and 12%. We're now above the 10% threshold ... so that's concerning," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that there has always been a push and pull between the federal and state government.
"If you remember back to 2016, the federal government came into the state of Texas and said, you're not qualifying enough kids. You're at 8%. Then all of a sudden, as Amanda told you this morning, there's been a change in the regulation. Now we're looking at the number is swinging to the other side of the pendulum where there's probably going to be a time where the feds come back into the state saying, well, now you're over identifying kids. So there's kind of that sweet spot, again, between 10 and 12% where we really want to be with eligibility," Gabrylczyk said.
On behavior, he said, the district has students with significant issues with behavior and they do things that are not aligned with district expectations. Gabrylczyk said there has been an increase in behavior issues, but there is no one reason for that.
Special education students fall under district policies and procedures for up to 10 days.
"A principal can discipline a student for up to 10 days for violation of policy. Once they get to that 10th day there's a mechanism within special education law called Manifestation of Determination. What we do with that Manifest Determination mechanism is call a meeting with parents, school officials and sometimes if the student is for an example, at the high school level, they will be invited to the meeting to review what is happening with the student in the areas of behavior," Gabrylczyk said.
"For an example if we are seeing a trend with the behavior, that meeting is established not for discipline, consequences but for change of placement. Is this the correct placement for the student who's having these issues? Because we've suspended the student for 10 days ... Maybe this environment is not the right environment for the student, so we have that MDR meeting, manifest determination review meeting, to determine the placement for that student. Do we move a student from a less restrictive environment to a more restrictive environment? That's what we do with that meeting. That team looks at all the data and makes that determination whether or not that student's disability had an effect on why that student did the discipline," Gabrylczyk said.
There are cases where the disability did not have an effect on the behavior. If that's the case, the student is disciplined accordingly to district policies.
"If the student's disability had an effect on the behavior, then this student is placed right where they're at and stay put. Then what we have to do as a school system is develop a plan — a better plan — to curb and eliminate that behavior and to make sure that that student is making progress in that particular area," Gabrylczyk said.
He added that no special education students can be expelled.
"What ends up happening is we have what we call special circumstances. If you have a special education student, for example, who was trafficking drugs on a campus, that is considered a special circumstance. Another special circumstance is a student who brings a weapon on campus. That is a special circumstance and then the last special circumstance deals with whether or not there was bodily harm done to either a student or a staff member," Gabrylczyk said.
"That would be a special circumstance. For an example, when you're looking at that particular special circumstance, the law says that that student assault on an individual has to have had severe bodily harm on that student. We've been advised by our attorneys who interpret the law for us ...," it's like a hospitalization; a near death experience, he added.
Gabrylczyk said a fight doesn't necessarily constitute a special circumstance.
"Even if a student is taken to a hospital or staff members taken to a hospital, that still may not be good enough, but what we've been told by our attorneys is if there's an ambulance that's involved, there could be some issues within that element of that special circumstance," he added.
Students that fall under special circumstances are placed in the Alternative Education Center for a certain amount of days.
"But with that discipline, they can't go over 40 days without having another hearing, and so more than likely the student is going to have their due process rights heard and then a decision will be made within that meeting," Gabrylczyk said.
"School discipline, and judicial discipline are two separate things. We tend to like to integrate it. So you could have a student who assaults somebody and they could end up in the judicial system ... But the only thing we're responsible for is what the law is pertaining to schools and school districts," Gabrylczyk said.

Article: The Borussia Dortmund vs PSG live stream is the first leg of what promises to be a fascinating Champions League semi-final clash between the old and the new of European soccer. You can watch it live from anywhere with a VPN.
Dortmund, who last lifted this trophy in 1997, have been consistently inconsistent in 2023/24. Edin Terzic's side have picked up four points from their last 12 domestically to drop to fifth, the weekend's 4-1 hammering at rivals RB Leipzig a devastating blow. BVB's goalscorer was Jadon Sancho, who fired his 40th Bundesliga strike to become the top-scoring Englishman in the German top flight. The Man United loanee is finding his feet back at Westfalendstadion and will be determined to put in another thrilling attacking display.
Crowned French champions for a record-extending 12th time at the weekend, PSG have their eyes firmly fixed on the prize they covet most. Since the Parisians' acquisition by Qatari backers in 2011, Champions League victory has been the goal. In the quarter-finals, Kylian Mbappe led the charge with a superb second-leg showing to win 4-1 in Barcelona and avenge the memory of 2017's injury-time capitulation. The 25-year-old will want to cement his status atop the European footballing tree.
The group stage fixtures between the sides late last year finished with a 1-1 draw in Dortmund and a 2-0 PSG win in the French capital. What will happen when it matters most? Make sure you don’t miss a single game by checking out how to watch Champions League live streams.

Article: NEW ORLEANS — (AP) — A new congressional map giving Louisiana a second majority-Black House district was rejected Tuesday by a panel of three federal judges, fueling new uncertainty about district boundaries as the state prepares for fall congressional elections.
The 2-1 ruling forbids the use of a map drawn up in January by the Legislature after a different federal judge blocked a map from 2022. The earlier map maintained a single Black-majority district and five mostly white districts, in a state with a population that is about one-third Black.
The National Democratic Redistricting Committee said backers of the new map will likely seek an emergency order from the U.S. Supreme Court to keep the new map in place while appeals are pursued.
U.S. District Judges David Joseph and Robert Summerhays, both of whom were nominated to the bench by former President Donald Trump, said the newest map violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because “race was the predominate factor” driving its creation.
Judge Carl Stewart dissented, saying the majority gave too little weight to the political motivations involved in drawing the map.
“The panel majority is correct in noting that this is a mixed motive case,” Stewart wrote. “But to note this and then to subsequently make a conclusory determination as to racial predominance is hard to comprehend.”
The ruling means continued uncertainty over what the November election map will look like. Another federal district judge, Shelly Dick of Baton Rouge, has ruled that the state is likely in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act because it divides Black voters not included in majority-Black District 2 among five other congressional districts.
But Tuesday's ruling from the divided federal panel noted that “outside of southeast Louisiana, the State’s Black population is dispersed." The majority criticized the new mostly Black district, which stretched across the state from Shreveport in the northwest into southeast Louisiana, linking black populations from the Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge metro areas.
Joseph and Summerhays said they would not rule on the feasibility of creating a second majority-Black district that would comply with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
“However, we do emphasize that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act never requires race to predominate in drawing Congressional districts at the sacrifice of traditional districting principles,” they wrote.
The panel set a May 6 status conference. Meanwhile, the case before Judge Dick in Baton Rouge is still alive, and state election officials say they need to know the district boundaries by May 15. The sign-up period for the fall elections in Louisiana is in mid-July.
The decision gives new hope to Rep. Garret Graves, a white Republican incumbent whose district was seriously altered by the new map. And it raises questions for state Sen. Cleo Fields, a Democrat and former Congress member who had declared he would run in the new district.
Rep. Troy Carter, the only Democrat and only Black member of the state's current congressional delegation, criticized the ruling.
“This is just plain WRONG,” Carter posted on the social platform X on Tuesday evening.
The new map maintains safe districts for five incumbents: Carter and four white Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise. It was challenged by 12 self-described non-African American voters, whose lawsuit said the districts amounted to unconstitutional racial gerrymandering.
Supporters of the new map said politics, not race, was the main factor driving its creation — and that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry’s support for it bolstered that argument. The plan had put Graves, who supported an opponent of Landry in last fall’s governor’s race, at a disadvantage.
The Associated Press left a telephone message seeking comment with Landry's office Tuesday night.
The majority in Tuesday's opinion acknowledged the argument. “However, given the slim majority Republicans hold in the United States House of Representatives, even if such personal or intra-party animosity did or does exist, it is difficult to fathom that Louisiana Republicans would intentionally concede a seat to a Democratic candidate on those bases,” they wrote.
The ruling was the latest development in a drawn-out legal battle over redistricting, which happens every 10 years to account for population shifts reflected in census data.
Louisiana’s Republican-dominated Legislature drew a new map in 2022 that was favorable to all six current incumbents. Then-Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, vetoed the map, but the majority-Republican Legislature overrode him, leading to a court challenge.
In June 2022, Dick issued an injunction against the map, saying challengers would likely win their claim that it violated the Voting Rights Act. As the case was appealed, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an unexpected ruling that favored Black voters in a congressional redistricting case in Alabama.
Dick sided with challengers who said the 2022 map packed a significant number of voters in one district — District 2 which stretches from New Orleans to the Baton Rouge area — while “cracking” the remaining Black population by apportioning it to other mostly white districts.
Last November, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave the state a January deadline for drawing a new congressional district. Landry, who was the state’s attorney general when he was elected to succeed the term-limited Edwards, called a special session to redraw the map, saying the Legislature should do it rather than a federal judge.
The new map does not resemble sample maps that supporters of a new majority-Black district suggested earlier, which would have created a new district largely covering the northeastern part of the state.
The opponents of the latest map filed their lawsuit in the federal court system’s Western District of Louisiana, which is dominated by Republican-appointed judges. Dick was nominated to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama. Stewart, the dissenter on the panel, was nominated to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by former President Bill Clinton.
Such cases involving constitutional issues and remapping are often assigned to panels of two district judges and an appeals court circuit judge.

Article: The world of college sports is known to spotlight some of the most talented athletes who dazzle us with their skills on the court or field. But what about their lives off the playing field? Connor McCaffery, the multi-talented athlete from the University of Iowa, and Caitlin Clark, a standout player for the University of Iowa women's basketball team, have garnered attention not only for their sporting prowess but also for their beautiful relationship. The lovers recently celebrated their one-year anniversary, as McCaffery shared a glimpse of their happy times in a sweet Instagram post. Here’s all you need to know about Clark’s boyfriend.
Connor McCaffery’s Background
Connor McCaffery is a name synonymous with dedication in collegiate sports. Born on July 13, 1998, in Iowa City, Iowa, Connor grew up in a family deeply ingrained in sports. His father, Fran McCaffery, has been the head coach of the University of Iowa men’s basketball team since 2010. His mother, Margeret McCaffery, also played college basketball at the University of Notre Dame. It's no wonder that athletics runs in Connor's blood.
Connor began making waves early in his athletic career. Excelling in both basketball and baseball, he was a highly sought-after recruit out of high school. Ultimately, he chose to attend the University of Iowa. Now, he has become a key player for the Hawkeyes' basketball team. On the court, Connor McCaffery's skills are evident. As a point guard for the Hawkeyes, Connor has showcased his leadership qualities and basketball IQ, contributing significantly to the team's success.
Hawkeye Baseball Player
Before focusing solely on college basketball, McCaffery also showcased great baseball talent. He played for the Hawkeye baseball team. Playing both corner outfield spots and first base, McCaffery often made local headlines for his plays. Although he had the potential to go big in the sport and could’ve been drafted into the Major League, his injuries and health complications hindered him. Furthermore, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, it put a stop to the baseball season that year.
Joining The Indiana Pacers
As a sports genius, McCaffery didn’t stop at just playing basketball and baseball. He has also become involved in the NBA’s Indiana Pacers. Following his graduation from the University of Iowa in May 2023, McCaffery embarked on a new chapter by joining the Indiana Pacers as a team assistant. Balancing rigorous training and competitions with his basketball and baseball teams, he also pursued degrees in finance and political science.
Connor McCaffery And Caitlin Clark
Connor McCaffery and Caitlin Clark began dating in April 2023, forming a power couple in the world of collegiate athletics. However, they chose to keep their relationship private for several months before making it public. It wasn't until Clark posted a photo with McCaffery on her Instagram in August that their fans learned about their romance. In the relationship debut photo, the two were cuddled up in a boat, and Clark captioned it: “Best end to summer.”
McCaffery on the other hand, waited until Clark’s birthday on January 22, to post her on his Instagram account. Wishing her a happy birthday, he wrote: “Happy Birthday 22. Wish I was there to celebrate with you — you deserve the best day. Golden Bday / T Swift year will be the best yet. With all that you’ve already accomplished, there is so much more in store for you and your special self. I admire you in every way and I love you.” Months later, the two lovebirds celebrated their first anniversary, with McCaffery penning a lovely post to the woman with his heart. The post read: “One year w the best. Doing life w u has been easy, and you never cease to amaze me… can’t wait to watch u live out urdreams in person. Love you.”

Article: Police surround Columbia University as antiwar protests grow at U.S. campuses
Updated April 30, 2024 at 21:15 PM ET
New York police surrounded Columbia University and activists put out calls for more protestors on social media as the chaotic pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus appeared to reach a turning point late Tuesday.
Protesters have occupied the central campus building of Hamilton Hall for most of Tuesday, after the school asked them to voluntarily disperse from an encampment.
The NYPD, with some officers seen in riot gear and carrying zip tie handcuffs, blocked off sections of Broadway near the Columbia Morningside campus late Tuesday.
Activists asked supporters on social media to "mobilize." And people have shown up. A large crowd of protesters gathered outside of the gates of the campus Tuesday evening.
The tensions are one snapshot of protests erupting at college campuses across the U.S. The students are calling for universities to sell off their investments in companies that have businesses or investments in Israel because of the country's invasion of Gaza.
The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, while Israel says some 1,200 Israelis were killed by Hamas in an assault last October. Israel says Hamas is still holding 133 hostages.
Columbia has started suspending the students who have refused to leave and they now face expulsion.
In announcing the disciplinary actions, the school saidon Tuesday that the protesters "have chosen to escalate to an untenable situation."
Two prominent New York Democrats, U.S. Reps. Jerry Nadler and Adriano Espailla, called on the school to "move quickly and swiftly to remove the students who have engaged in unlawful activity."
They wrote in a shared statement that the students are entitled to free speech, but criticized recent actions of the demonstrations at Columbia.
On the other side of the U.S., students broke into the library at Portland State University in Oregon, triggering a campus-wide shutdown.
Many such demonstrations continue with no end in sight, but administrations at Northwestern University and Brown University managed to strike deals with protesters that included agreements to examine the schools' investments.
Campuses see big protests across the U.S.
In Oregon, Portland State University closed its campus on Tuesday, after demonstrators took over the school's library. The protesters broke into the Branford Price Millar Library during the night, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports.
Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt's office said his position is that "the actions taking place have crossed into criminal behavior, and we will prosecute."
Earlier on Tuesday at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, police arrested demonstrators who refused to shut down a "Gaza Solidarity Encampment" protest that began at the Polk Place quad on campus Friday.
Police detained some 30 protesters and moved them elsewhere on campus, according to student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel, which says six people in the group were arrested. Video posted on Instagram by the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine showed UNC police chief Brian James informing protesters that they were trespassing, as they chanted, "We will not stop, we will not rest."
UNC interim Chancellor Lee Roberts and Provost Christopher Clemens sent a letter early Tuesday ordering protesters to dismantle the camp and leave, threatening arrests and potential expulsion.
On Monday, police arrested nearly 80 people protesting in support of Palestinians at the University of Texas at Austin after demonstrators set up an encampment on the south lawn, according to member station KUT.
"Police and troopers in riot gear surrounded the protesters and made arrests," KUT reports.
UT Austin says that protesters "escalated by becoming physically and verbally combative" when approached, adding that it moved against the encampment because demonstrators' tents violated school rules. The arrests were for trespassing or disorderly conduct, it said.
The Palestine Solidarity Committee in Austin, a group organizing protests, condemned school president Jay Hartzell's administration for "yet again calling police to violently suppress students" — a reference to dozens of arrests made last Wednesday.
Along with its demands related to Israel and the Palestinians, the group says Hartzell — who has Gov. Greg Abbott's support — must resign. The group says it plans to hold another demonstration on Wednesday at noon, local time.
Northwestern and Brown reach agreements with protestors
This week Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and, as of Tuesday, Brown University in Rhode Island reached deals with student protesters to deescalate the demonstrations.
Brown President Christina Paxson shared details on the agreement in a campus-wide message on Tuesday.
"The devastation and loss of life in the Middle East has prompted many to call for meaningful change, while also raising real issues about how best to accomplish this," Paxson wrote. "Brown has always prided itself on resolving differences through dialog, debate and listening to each other."
Students of the Brown Divest Coalition set up an unauthorized encampment on the school's College Green on April 24, according to the university. With this new deal to deescalate protests, the students have agreed to end the encampment by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Additionally, they will refrain from any further actions "that would violate Brown's conduct code" through the end of the school year, including Commencement and Reunion Weekend.
In return, the school said it would invite five students to meet with five members of the Corporation of Brown University, the University's governing body that includes a Board of Trustees and a Board of Fellows, in May. The students will be allowed to hold a presentation on why Brown's endowment should divest from "companies enabling and profiting from the genocide in Gaza," the agreement stated.
Paxson said she will also ask the Advisory Committee on University Resources Management, the panel responsible for reviewing whether Brown's business and investment practices follow ethical and moral standards consistent with the school's goals and values, to provide a recommendation on divestment by Sept. 30, which will then be brought to the Corporation for a vote at its October meeting.
Dozens of tents set up by protesters at Northwestern in Evanston have been removed from the school's Deering Meadow, after a pro-Palestinian coalition agreed to a deal with school leaders on Monday.
Under the agreement, the Northwestern Divestment Coalition can continue to organize limited protests through at least June 1. Protesters who aren't affiliated with the school are also barred from participating.
In return, the school agreed to transparency measures around its investments, to give support to Middle Eastern and Muslim students, and to fund the "full cost of attendance for five Palestinian undergraduates" to attend the school for four years, along with two visiting Palestinian faculty for two years.
The university also said it will look to add more support for Jewish students. It called recent reports of antisemitic and anti-Muslim/Palestinian incidents "unacceptable."
The school said its goal was to "ensure that the violence and escalation we have seen elsewhere does not happen here at Northwestern."
Columbia and protesters hit a new impasse on Monday
While demonstrators elsewhere have reached deals with their schools' administrations, campus officials at Columbia have rejected student demands to divest from companies operating in Israel.
So, students entered Hamilton Hall early Tuesday morning, chained and barricaded its doors and have been using a rope system to get supplies from supporters, reported WKCR, the university radio station.
Outside, a crowd cheered as the facade was draped with signs reading "Intifada" and "Hind's Hall" — the latter a reference to Hind Rajab, a young Palestinian girl who was killed in Gaza in January.
The university is now under what amounts to a lockdown of the campus in Manhattan's Morningside Heights, with access restricted to essential-service employees and students who live in residential halls on the campus.
"This building has now been liberated," an Instagram account affiliated with the student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest announced as it posted an image of Hamilton Hall, echoing language used during a 1968 protest.
Columbia students protesting racism against Black people and the Vietnam War were occupying Hamilton Hall and other buildings exactly 56 years ago — on April 30, 1968 — when police violently cleared the campus. More than 700 people were arrested and almost 150 people were injured.
The New York Police Department says it has officers stationed outside the university, but not on school grounds.
Tuesday's campus shutdown was mirrored by one at Barnard College, which is closely affiliated with Columbia.
Columbia's leadership has set several deadlines as it seeks to reach an agreement with demonstrators to end the encampment, as the school said it violates school policies and is a threat to campus safety, a disturbance to Jewish students and students trying to study and sleep.
Columbia seeks ways to hold graduation ceremony
Columbia's last day of classes for the spring semester was Monday, marking the start of "reading week," in which students traditionally prepare for looming final exams. Those exams are currently set to begin on Friday, with commencement planned for May 15.
Columbia President Minouche Shafik said on Monday that she wanted the protesters to "disperse voluntarily," urging them to consider that the graduating class of 2024 did not get to have their high school commencement ceremonies in person due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The president also said the school was prepared to allow demonstrations to resume after exams and commencement. But, Shafik added, protesters would need to submit an application at least two days in advance, and protests would be allowed only in designated areas.
Shafik said Columbia has supported protests and vigils that happened earlier in the year, as they were peaceful and didn't disturb campus operations.
But she added the encampment has caused an "unwelcoming environment" and "hostile environment" for Jewish students, and violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws discrimination at schools that receive federal funding.

Article: Members of Fort Worth’s ad hoc council committee on emergency medical response have recommended that MedStar employees who transition to the proposed fire department-based EMS model receive civil service benefits.
Michael Glynn, president of the Fort Worth Professional Firefighters Association, called the decision “the right thing to do,” and said it sends a message that Fort Worth is committed to caring for its EMS employees.
Tuesday’s decision comes two weeks after the committee narrowed down the EMS options under consideration to a fire-based model that would incorporate MedStar employees. If the Fort Worth City Council approves the committee’s recommendation, MedStar’s current employees would come on board as Fort Worth employees and serve as paramedics and emergency medical technicians on ambulances run by the Fire Department.
“This is going to be a great opportunity for us to work together as one team in one department,” Glynn told the Star-Telegram.
Even though the EMS workers wouldn’t serve as firefighters, their status as civil service employees would allow them to receive line-of-duty death and injury benefits, among other protections afforded to firefighters and police officers.
The Fort Worth City Council is expected to vote on adopting the ad hoc committee’s EMS recommendations and the implementation/transition plan on May 21.
MedStar has served as the sole ambulance provider for Fort Worth and the surrounding communities since 1986. Spokesperson Matt Zavadsky said MedStar will support whatever decision the council makes.
“Whatever it’s going to take to make a smooth transition and make sure that the new system is as operationally efficient, and clinically proficient as possible, we want to help facilitate that,” Zavadsky said.
Assistant City Manager Valerie Washington said the city’s goal is to make the change to fire-based EMS as easy as possible for residents.
“We’re going to do everything we can to make it a seamless process so users of the system won’t notice anything,” Washington said.
According to Washington, the transition could take up to 18 months, though she thinks that estimate is on the high end. City officials are working with Fitch and Associates, the independent consultant hired to assess Fort Worth’s EMS system, to fine tune the timeline.
A major part of the transition, according to Washington, will be the hiring and onboarding of employees to staff the ambulances.
“We would anticipate sitting down with all of the (MedStar) employees and determining, you know, which ones can move over,” Washington said. “We’re anticipating that many of them will.”
According to Zavadsky, the ambulance service currently employs around 400 paramedics and emergency medical technicians. Around 100 more employees work in dispatch and various support roles, including logistics, human resources, payroll and those who re-stock the ambulances.
It’s not clear where those who serve in support roles at MedStar would fit into the new EMS model, but Washington said some of those functions may go to other city departments outside the Fire Department.
Another part of the transition, Washington said, will be working with local hospitals and other healthcare facilities to manage their own inter-facility transports. MedStar currently provides all inter-facility transports for Fort Worth and the 13 member cities.
Officials said Tuesday that an inter-facility transfer working group will identify vendors and help coordinate the details for this portion of the transition.
“That’s definitely one of those processes that we want to make sure is solid,” Washington told the Star-Telegram.
Fort Worth is also working toward streamlining its 911 service. Currently the Fort Worth Police Department, Fire Department and MedStar each use separate communications and dispatch centers. Washington said the goal is to get all of the area’s emergency services using the same technology and eventually bring them under the same roof.
“Our goal is making sure the 911 process is as efficient as possible and making sure the end users get the fast service that they need,” Washington said at Tuesday’s meeting. “We know that time matters, and so we’re trying to find where there are minutes, seconds in the process that we could shave this down.”
