Error in completion_gradient: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 112.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 19.58 GiB of which 109.06 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 19.44 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 19.08 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 129.90 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
