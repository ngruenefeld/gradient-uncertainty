You have loaded an AWQ model on CPU and have a CUDA device available, make sure to set your model on a GPU device in order to run your model.
`low_cpu_mem_usage` was None, now default to True since model is quantized.
huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used. Disabling parallelism to avoid deadlocks...
To disable this warning, you can either:
	- Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible
	- Explicitly set the environment variable TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)

torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 7.82 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 19.71 GiB of which 6.20 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 13.48 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.99 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 1.26 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
