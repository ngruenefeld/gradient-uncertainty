Loading model: bert-base-uncased
BertForMaskedLM has generative capabilities, as `prepare_inputs_for_generation` is explicitly overwritten. However, it doesn't directly inherit from `GenerationMixin`. From 👉v4.50👈 onwards, `PreTrainedModel` will NOT inherit from `GenerationMixin`, and this model will lose the ability to call `generate` and other related functions.
  - If you're using `trust_remote_code=True`, you can get rid of this warning by loading the model with an auto class. See https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#auto-classes
  - If you are the owner of the model architecture code, please modify your model class such that it inherits from `GenerationMixin` (after `PreTrainedModel`, otherwise you'll get an exception).
  - If you are not the owner of the model architecture class, please contact the model code owner to update it.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForMaskedLM: ['bert.pooler.dense.bias', 'bert.pooler.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForMaskedLM from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

Original sentence: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.

Original sentence: People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb.

Original sentence: People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb.

Original sentence: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.

Original sentence: People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb.

Original sentence: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.

Answer: In the case of Inspector Phillip Estreich v Hannas Civil Engineering Pty Ltd and Afram Hanna [2009] NSWIRComm 168, the defendants were charged under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 for a serious breach of safety. The incident involved a worker who was injured while cutting an orange conduit that was assumed to hold no energised cable or services, but in fact held an 11,000 volt electric cable. The work was not performed in accordance with the company's documented safety system and the risk was foreseeable. Both the company and the contracted supervisor pleaded guilty. The company had a prior record, while the supervisor did not. The company showed contrition, entered an early plea, and took numerous remedial steps after the accident. The supervisor changed his original plea, but the circumstances warranted a significant discount. Penalties were imposed considering the company's good industrial record, good corporate citizenship, and co-operation with the WorkCover Authority.

Answer: In Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1329, the Commonwealth argued that habeas corpus did not apply as the rescuees were not detained. They contended that for a detention to occur, the detainer must subject the detainee to a total restraint of movement, and that partial restraint or obstruction from going in a particular direction does not constitute detention. They further argued that the rescuees were only prevented from going to their preferred destination and were free to go elsewhere, thus not constituting detention. However, this argument was not accepted by the court, which disagreed with the suggestion that a "total restraint of movement" is necessary to constitute detention amenable to habeas corpus.

Original sentence: Question: What is the test for determining a "genuine" dispute or claim in the context of section 459H, as interpreted by Australian Commonwealth courts?
Answer: The test for determining a "genuine" dispute or claim under section 459H, as interpreted by Australian Commonwealth courts, is often phrased as "whether there is a serious issue to be tried". The test is not a particularly high one, but the court must be satisfied that there is a claim that may have some substance. This interpretation has been the subject of much judicial consideration, as seen in cases such as Mibor Investments Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Ltd, Scanhill Pty Ltd v Century 21 Australasia Pty Ltd, Chadwick Industries (South Coast) Pty Ltd v Condensing Vaporisers Pty Ltd, Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd, and Chase Manhattan Bank Australia Ltd v Oscty Pty Ltd.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of the Anti-Discrimination Act (AD Act) in New South Wales, how is the term "incite" interpreted in relation to the offence of serious racial vilification?
Answer: In the case of John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd -v- Kazak (EOD) [2002] NSWADTAP 35, it was argued that the term "incite" in section 20D(1) of the Anti-Discrimination Act, which creates the offence of serious racial vilification, requires an intention to incite. This interpretation is established by authority with respect to criminal offences relating to incitement. However, the same term in other provisions of the Act may not be construed in the same way, as the context within which the word "incite" appears in different provisions of the Act can affect its interpretation. The presumption that the same word is intended to have the same meaning in each case is of little weight and readily yields to the statutory context.

Answer: Under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW), the New South Wales Crime Commission can apply for a restraining order in respect of certain interests, such as property interests.

Answer: Under the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme Amendment Act 2016 (Cth), if a person's application for a payment under the BSWAT payment scheme was refused before the commencement day due to a determination that the payment amount for the person was nil, the Secretary is required to review the original determination as soon as practicable after the commencement day. The review should be conducted under section 23 of the BSWAT Act, on the basis that the payment amount for the person is to be worked out using the 70% principle. If the payment amount worked out on review is more than nil, the Secretary must substitute a new determination of the payment amount and make an offer to the person under section 19 of the BSWAT Act. This applies even if paragraph 23(2)(c) of the BSWAT Act would otherwise prevent the Secretary from reviewing the determination.

The court reasoned that there was no need to include these details in the forms she signed as they only requested the description of the accident, not the events leading up to it. Furthermore, the court found that what was recorded in the forms and the histories by the doctors was completely consistent with the version of the accident given by the plaintiff in her sworn evidence.

Answer: In the case of Collins v The Queen [2018] HCA 18, the Court of Appeal considered three main considerations to conclude that the prosecution case was strong and guilt had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. First, despite some inconsistencies in the complainant's account, the complainant had given "a relatively robust and unvarying account of the essential features of the conduct making up the offences". Second, the physical evidence of the clippers supported parts of the complainant's account. Third, preliminary complaints had been made not only to Ms M but also to AJ and Ian Haberfield. The Court of Appeal also noted that the two aspects of the 2007 account that were inconsistent with Ms M's evidence in chief were not put to the complainant in cross-examination, and the complainant's account of the telephone call was not challenged. The Court of Appeal stated that the lack of challenge to the complainant's account of the telephone call considerably weakened the proposition that the jury was deprived of the chance to consider the 2007 account in assessing the complainant's evidence.

Answer: In the decision of Amir v Director of Professional Services Review [2021] FCA 745, the term "decide" in s 88A(1) is construed as an externally manifested communication by the Director of an irrevocable commitment by her whether or not to undertake a review. This externally manifested communication of an irrevocable commitment by the Director might be to her staff or others, or by the giving of notice as required by s 88A(4). Everything which occurs before either of these events does not involve the Director “making up” the Director’s mind because such acts, of necessity, are not final and are not irrevocable. They are subject to change as and when the Director determines within the period of one month provided for the making of the decision.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of the Australian Commonwealth jurisdiction, when is a debt considered to be contracted by a company in relation to the purchase of shares?
Answer: In the decision of Shapowloff v Dunn [1981] HCA 21, it was concluded that a debt as spoken of in s. 303 (3) was contracted by the company on the date when the broker bought the shares. On that day, the broker began and completed the execution of the company's buying order and the company became liable to indemnify the broker for the purchase price of the shares. This liability was contingent on the delivery of the scrip by the selling broker. Such a contingent liability falls within s. 303 (3) and is enough to constitute a debt falling within that section.

Answer: In the case of JONES v MARTIN [2000] NSWSC 1112, it was noted that there needs to be evidence that one of the parties had in some way contributed to the other's superannuation entitlements.

Answer: In the case of Diakovasili & Anor v Order of AHEPA NSW Incorporated [2023] NSWSC 1282, the second aspect of the Plaintiffs' proposed case was a claim that continuing fiduciary duties owed by the Nine Defendants were breached when four of them, Messrs Kallimanis, Premetis, Fandakis and Papanagiotou (“Four Defendants”) were involved with RPS in the RPS DOCA which allegedly had the result that RPS acquired the Rockdale Properties at undervalue. The claim was only proposed to be made against the Four Defendants and RPS. The Plaintiffs' case was opened on the basis that the Four Defendants, with the knowing assistance of RPS, breached the fiduciary duties they owed to AHEPA NSW by misusing their position as committee members/former committee members by causing the administrators to agree to sell the Rockdale Properties owned by AHEPA NSW to RPS at a gross undervalue, despite knowing the true value of the properties at the time of the transaction. The properties were sold for a price of $4.4 million when the true value at the relevant time was at least $6 million.

Answer: In the case of Fulton v Chief of Defence Force [2023] FCAFC 134, the court considered several factors in deciding whether to grant relief to FLTLT Fulton under s 16 of the ADJR Act. One factor was the lapse of time since the termination decision was made, which was over two and a half years ago. However, the court did not view this delay as a factor against granting relief as the trial of the proceeding in the original jurisdiction was consensually deferred. Another factor was FLTLT Fulton's repeated failure over a lengthy period to pass a PFT. However, the court found it odd that despite this, FLTLT Fulton was retained in the RAAF for some 18 years, promoted and deployed on operational service, which involved a waiver of a requirement to pass a PFT. The court also noted that there were other instances in FLTLT Fulton’s service history where a requirement to undertake a PFT was deferred for medical reasons. Furthermore, his most recent PPRs (2018 and 2019) did not rate him as unsuitable, rather the reverse.

Original sentence: Question: What were the two issues in the appeal case of Millar v Commissioner of Taxation [2016] FCAFC 94 in the Commonwealth jurisdiction?
Answer: In the appeal case of Millar v Commissioner of Taxation [2016] FCAFC 94, the two issues were: firstly, whether the primary judge was correct to hold that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not err in law in concluding that the appellants had not discharged their onus of proving that a loan arrangement they had entered into with a Samoan entity, Hua Wang Bank Berhad, was not a sham. The second issue was whether the primary judge was correct to hold that the taxpayers were required by s 12-245 of Sch 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) to pay withholding tax on the interest that was capitalised under the terms of that loan arrangement, and the failure to do so meant that the taxpayers were precluded by s 26-25 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) from deducting the interest. The withholding tax issue only arises if the conclusions of the Tribunal and the primary judge were in error on the sham issue.

Original sentence: Question: What is the importance of procedural fairness in the context of litigation according to the decision in Seltsam Pty Limited v Ghaleb [2005] NSWCA 208?
Answer: In the decision of Seltsam Pty Limited v Ghaleb [2005] NSWCA 208, it was highlighted that procedural fairness is crucial to both the reality and the appearance of justice. It involves affording a reasonable opportunity to present or meet a case. This opportunity is vital as just outcomes are grounded upon the court or tribunal addressing the issues presented, particularly where litigation proceeds according to the adversary principle. A lack of procedural fairness can occur when an adjudicator hears evidence or receives argument from one side without the knowledge of the other, or refuses to entertain a relevant argument that one party wishes to put. The reasons for this are twofold: firstly, the appearance of fairness has been shattered in a material respect; secondly, the risk of prejudice is enough to warrant concern, regardless of whether the evidence or representations did work to the party's prejudice.

Answer: In the case of Au v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs [2021] FCA 1240, the Tribunal's assessment of the applicant's likelihood of reoffending was influenced by its evaluation of the applicant's drug habit as the root of his criminal offending.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, does a "C" mandate confer the nationality of the mandatary on the inhabitants of the territory?
Answer: No, a "C" mandate does not confer the nationality of the mandatary on the inhabitants of the territory. This point was discussed in the case of Wong Man On v Commonwealth [1952] HCA 27, where it was noted that there seems to be near unanimity among international jurists that a Territory the subject of a "C" mandate does not become part of the dominions of the mandatary in such a sense as to confer on the inhabitants the nationality of the mandatary. This view is also supported by the Council of the League's resolutions adopted in April 1923, which state that the inhabitants of "B" and "C" mandated areas have a distinct status from that of the mandatary's nationals and do not automatically become invested with its nationality.

Original sentence: Question: What does Section 118 of the Australian Constitution dictate in relation to State choice of law rules and how does it affect the application of law in cases of intranational torts?
Answer: According to the decision in McKain v RW Miller & Co (South Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 56, Section 118 of the Australian Constitution dictates that State choice of law rules must conform to a certain consequence. The law of a State or Territory is applied in another State or Territory not by reason of extended or extraterritorial operation of that State or Territory law, but by operation of the choice of law rule applicable in the State or Territory where the matter falls for adjudication. The conflict of law rules which would otherwise be applied by a court of the forum are modified (or replaced) in their application to torts occurring within Australia in consequence of the effect attributed to Section 118 of the Constitution. This approach creates a unitary national legal system which attributes to the laws of the respective States the function of regulating conduct and things within their respective territories. The laws of the Territories, like the laws of the States, are part of the national legal system and are subject to like limitations on their territorial operation. In cases of intranational torts, the courts of the forum are not troubled by conflicts of law as there are no conflicts. In a particular case, the same relevant part of the national law alone applies to determine substantive liability, the law of the forum contributing only the procedural or adjectival law applicable to the proceedings.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of Australian immigration law, what is the significance of the "real chance" test and how does it relate to the concept of a "well-founded fear of persecution"?
Answer: In the decision of Buchari v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 432, it was noted that while the "real chance" test can be helpful, the Convention actually refers to a "well-founded fear of persecution". The Tribunal must address this issue and it is not necessarily problematic if it did not specifically apply the "real chance" test. The High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo (1997) 144 ALR 567 at 576 warned that the term 'real chance' should not be used as a replacement or substitution for 'well-founded', but rather tribunals should apply the language of the Convention. They should bear in mind that a fear of persecution may be well-founded even though the evidence does not show that persecution is more likely than not to eventuate.

Answer: In the case R v Alchin [2015] NSWSC 2112, two factors were identified in support of finding that Ashley James Alchin has shown cause for his release application. The first factor was the birth of Alchin's first child, who was three months old at the time, which was considered a motivating factor for him to comply with conditional bail. The second factor was the likelihood of a lengthy period on remand awaiting the trial date, during which Alchin would see very little of his child if bail was refused. This was seen as a factor likely to perpetuate the cycle of disadvantage and deprivation notoriously faced in indigenous communities and specifically faced in Alchin's family.

Answer: In the case of McMullin, Brian and Anor v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd & Ors [1996] FCA 991, the counsel for the applicants argued that it was unnecessary for him to call evidence from each of the group members in order to obtain findings against the respondents. He conceded that some of the group members must be called, particularly because some of the causes of action include a personal element such as reliance, causation or damage. However, his argument was that if these ingredients are established in connection with some group members, and the factors of general application are also proved, the applicants will be entitled to findings in their favour on liability. It would then be appropriate to move to the next stage of the trial: a one by one examination of the circumstances of each group member, this member being called to prove reliance or causation, as the case may be, and the precise extent of his or her damage.

Answer: In the case of R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289, the Crown's complaint about special circumstances was that the finding and the variation of the non-parole period amounted to double counting. The respondent addressed this by asserting that the discount was inadequate and that there were particular factors that warranted a finding of special circumstances. The respondent argued that a fair reading of the judge's remarks would suggest that no double counting can be demonstrated as the issues of a new identity and relocation were taken into account on the question of special circumstances and not otherwise. The respondent also suggested that the 55 per cent discount would, and should, have been higher if this were not so.

Original sentence: Question: What is the general approach to the construction and application of clauses in a document, as discussed in the case of JOHN DORAHY'S FITNESS CENTRE PTY LTD v BUCHANAN [1996] NSWCA 278?
Answer: In the case of JOHN DORAHY'S FITNESS CENTRE PTY LTD v BUCHANAN [1996] NSWCA 278, it was discussed that the approach to the construction and application of clauses in a document should be based on the intention of the parties, as determined by the proper construction of the document in its context. This principle is applicable to written documents generally. However, in the case of a clause that restricts the rights which ordinarily a party would have, the courts tend to look carefully at the precise terms of a document which limit, restrict or release rights, and give effect to such clauses only as far as and not beyond the limits of the clause.

The first respondent submitted that the first two grounds, alleging a breach of s 424A of the Act, were bound to fail because the Tribunal relied upon information supplied by the applicant and upon country information to reach its decision, and these two categories of information are excluded from the provisions of s 424A(1) by s 424A(3) of the Act. In relation to the third ground of appeal which alleges a breach of procedural fairness, the first respondent submitted that this ground was bound to fail because s 422B of the Act exhaustively sets out the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule and the Federal Magistrate made no error in concluding that the Tribunal had met those requirements.

Answer: In the case of Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Geeves [2004] FCAFC 166, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal determined that Mr Escott's beneficial interest in the trust was an asset within the meaning of s 11 and s 198D of the Act but that it was an excluded trust within the meaning of the amended s 198E. As a result, Ms Geeves was entitled to the carer payment at the time of cancellation. The primary Judge did not accept the Secretary's argument that the trust was already covered by the ordinary assets test, stating that the trust for Mr Escott is an "excluded trust" and therefore not a "designated private trust" for the purposes of Pt 3.18.

Answer: In Bhullar v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 1337, Mr Bhullar made an incorrect application due to a reasonable mistake of thinking he could appeal from the Tribunal’s decision. This misunderstanding was based on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) which suggests that such an appeal is available. However, section 483 of the Migration Act 1958 outflanks that provision, indicating that one must apply for constitutional writs where the Tribunal affirms a visa cancellation decision on character grounds. The court regarded Mr Bhullar’s position as being reasonable for a lay person.

Answer: In the case of SZNNK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1386, the Federal Magistrate found that the appellant had not particularised the jurisdictional error alleged and it was not appropriate for the Court to make an assumption about what he intended. The appellant's oral submissions seemed to be a request for impermissible merits review of the Tribunal decision and did not point to a jurisdictional error. The Federal Magistrate was unable to find any breach of procedural fairness because no particulars were provided. Regarding the appellant’s oral submissions about interpretation, the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the appellant was not prevented from presenting his case due to any failure in interpretation and found that the Tribunal had complied with its obligations pursuant to s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). The Federal Magistrate concluded that the Tribunal decision was free from jurisdictional error and dismissed the application.

Answer: In the case of Inspector Stevens v Ford [2011] NSWIRComm 10, the defendants opposed the amendment to the application for order for several reasons. Mr Moses, representing one of the defendants, relied on the judgment of the High Court in Kirk and the observations of the Full Bench of this Court in John Holland, arguing that the charges and particulars were "uncertain and gross" and therefore the prosecutor should not be allowed to amend. Senior counsel contended that the particulars in the prosecution against the defendant Harrison failed to inform the defendant either directly or by inference as to what measures it had failed to take. Mr Beazley opposed the amendment on the ground that it would not be in the interests of justice, noting that the act or omission occurred on 23 August 2005, the coronial inquest concluded on 23 August 2007 and that the proceedings were not commenced until 21 August 2009, two days before the statutory time limit.

Answer: In Al Toubi v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1381, it was stated that the applicant was not at risk of deportation from Syria because Arabs can remain in Syria indefinitely and are not at risk of refoulement. The exception to this is if a person has committed a crime or is a security risk. However, the applicant had lived in Syria for three consecutive years without being of concern for either of those reasons, so any chance that he would be deported was both remote and insubstantial. Furthermore, the applicant's wife continues to live in Syria legally and is in a position to 'sponsor' the applicant to return. The applicant's claim that his passport was false was not accepted, and it was established that the Syrian authorities do not require Arabs to have passports to enter the country. The applicant had satisfied the Syrian authorities that he does not pose a security risk and has observed all of the conditions to enter and exit the country legally.

Answer: In the case of Health Care Complaints Commissioner v Chamberlain [2017] NSWCATOD 122, the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal concluded that Dr. Chamberlain's conduct in documenting his medical records, specifically his assessment and treatment of Patient A from 2 May 2000 to 11 September 2012, fell significantly below the standard reasonably expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level of training or experience. The Tribunal found that he engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct on each of the bases particularised in respect of Complaint One B, either taken alone or in combination. This was because he contravened a provision of the NSW regulations made under s 247A(2)(d) of the National Law, within the meaning of s 139B(1)(b).

Answer: In the case of FFR v Commissioner of Victims Rights [2022] NSWCATAD 103, the issue for determination was whether the act of arson that occurred on 25 February 2021, and the injuries arising as a result of that act, made FFR eligible for victims support under Pt 4 of the Act. The tribunal decided that FFR was not eligible for victims support. This decision was based on the interpretation of the term "act of violence" as defined in s 19 of the Act and the definition of "injury" in s 18 of the Act, which was found to exclude an injury arising from loss or damage to property. Furthermore, the tribunal found that the evidence did not support a finding that the act of arson was either such as to cause personal intimidation or intended to cause intimidation or submission of FFR.

The court noted that the parties contracted at arm's length and that the plaintiff, a large commercial entity with considerable commercial experience and influence in the printing industry, should not have the terms of its contracts modified in favour of its customers simply because of its size and reputation. The court also stated that acceptance of the plaintiff's standard terms and conditions did not automatically work any discernible injustice upon the defendants.

Answer: In the case of Gunns Finance Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) v Marks-Isaacs (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 350, the court identified two issues with Mr Marks-Isaacs' hardship program application. Firstly, the hardship program was still available after the judgment, and the existence of the judgment did not prevent the alternative form of ex gratia relief from potentially being available to him. Secondly, Mr Marks-Isaacs did not appear to have reasonably pursued his hardship application.

Answer: In the case of SZQRC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012] FCA 851, the Minister's delegate decided on 24 March 2011 to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant. The delegate found the appellant not to be a witness of truth and that she had not provided a plausible or credible account of her circumstances in China. The delegate also found that the appellant’s claims were vague, inconsistent, lacked credible detail, and that her evidence was contradictory. The delegate also pointed to the appellant’s 18 months delay in applying for a protection visa after her arrival in Australia as being inconsistent with her claims to hold a genuine and significant fear for her life and safety in China.

The court further stated that the real reason the application for an extension of time should be refused was because it would have no utility, given the view that leave to appeal should also be refused.

Answer: In the case of Australis Construction Company v Leichhardt Municipal Council [2006] NSWLEC 38, the proposal resulted in a floor space ratio (FSR) of 0.6:1, which exceeded the 0.5:1 development standard by 20%. The objectives of the FSR standard, as set out in Clause 17(a) of LEP 2000, are to ensure that the density and landscaped areas of new housing are complementary to and compatible with the style, orientation and pattern of surrounding buildings. The proposal substantially failed to respect the built form requirements of Part B1.2 of DCP 2000 and was inconsistent with the existing and desired future character of the Nanny Goat Hill Distinctive Neighbourhood. The applicant did not demonstrate why the proposal should not comply with the standard, nor that a better planning outcome would be achieved by non-compliance. The proposal presented a built form directly contrary to the desired future character established under the DCP, using a significant non-compliance with the FSR standard to achieve this.

Original sentence: Question: Under the HREOC Act, can a new party be added as a respondent to a terminated complaint in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission?
Answer: According to the decision in O'Donoghue v State of Western Australia [2013] FCA 903, under s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, an application to the court may be made only in relation to “unlawful discrimination by one or more of the respondents to the terminated complaint”. The “terminated complaint” to which the section refers is the complaint in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the termination of which gave rise to the court's jurisdiction. In this case, none of the parties proposed to be added was a respondent to the applicant's complaint in the commission. Therefore, none could have been joined as a respondent to these proceedings, and none can now be joined upon the basis that they ought to have been joined originally under para (b) of r 8(1) of O 6 of the Rules of Court.

Answer: In the case of Orcher v Bowcliff Pty Ltd (No 4) [2011] NSWSC 862, Mr Sexton argued that the need to consider the matters that section 64 emphasises overrides any error in his previous statement. He believed that the case was not untenable and the need for a special relationship as the touchstone for the existence of vicarious liability was not yet settled. He further argued that the existence of some necessary relationship of employment or other agency or agreement was in this case established by or derived from the sale of liquor. According to him, Mr Paseka was someone engaged by or on behalf of Mr Keough in his capacity as the licensee of the Bridge Hotel to ensure that he did not permit intoxication, or any indecent, violent or quarrelsome conduct, on his licensed premises contrary to section 125(1)(b) of the Liquor Act. He also argued that the actions of Mr Paseka beyond the boundaries of the licensed premises of the Bridge Hotel did not prevent the actions of Mr Paseka falling within the terms of section 125(1)(b), to the extent that the assault was relevantly capable of being considered, in the context of an action taken for the benefit of the licensee for the purposes of the section, wherever it may physically have occurred or taken place.

Original sentence: Question: What is the calculus of risk approach in the context of New South Wales legal decisions, and how does it apply when the nature of the harm is severe?
Answer: In the context of New South Wales legal decisions, such as in the case of NSW Police Force v Alameddine (No. 2) [2023] NSWSC 633, the calculus of risk approach requires the court to consider the nature, imminence and degree of likelihood of harm occurring to the relevant person. If the prospective harm is very severe, such as death, it may be more readily concluded that an order is necessary even if the risk does not rise beyond a mere possibility. Under this approach, the nature of the harm carries weight in the calculus of risk, meaning that it would not be necessary for the court to be satisfied that it was probable that the threats would be carried out. The fact that the possible harm was so serious would lead to the court’s being satisfied under s 8(1)(c) that an order was necessary in circumstances where it could not be said to be probable that the threats would be carried out.

Original sentence: Question: What is the requirement for SAAB SF340 Series Aeroplanes as per the AD/SF340/6 Amdt 1 - Flap 20 Degree Limit Stop under the Commonwealth of Australia's Civil Aviation Regulations 1998?
Answer: Under the Commonwealth of Australia's Civil Aviation Regulations 1998, specifically AD/SF340/6 Amdt 1 - Flap 20 Degree Limit Stop, the requirement for SAAB SF340 Series Aeroplanes, specifically SF 340A with S/Nos. 004 to 138 not incorporating Modification No 1462 and 1784, is to take action in accordance with S.B. SF 340-27-036. This is due to the established fact that an insufficient margin of flow separation exists on the right hand stabilizer during certain icing conditions that need not be severe. Furthermore, it was found that the flight manual restriction was insufficient as pilots were having difficulty in determining if an ice degraded condition existed. Amendment 1 provides for the restoration of full flap travel in modified aircraft and extends aircraft effectivity. Compliance is required prior to further flight after 5 May 1986.

Answer: In McGrath v Mestousis [2017] NSWSC 995, the court was satisfied that the use of 32 Darwin having the benefit of the easement was not inconsistent with the public interest. The court noted that the easement was part of a common type of development in many areas of Sydney and there was no evidence to suggest that the development, including the use of the easement, would be contrary to the public interest. On the contrary, the development and use were in accordance with the Council consent given on 11 May 2017. The court assumed that the consent was given after consideration by the Council of the matters required to be taken into account under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW). The evidence of Mr Kenny concerning the merits of various alternative routes for an easement further supported this conclusion.

Answer: In the case of Passion Projects (ALLYOUNEEDISLOVE) Pty Ltd v Concept Moulding Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 415, the principles governing the grant of leave as identified in Be Financial Pty Ltd as Trustee for Be Financial Operations Trust v Das [2012] NSWCA 164 were referenced. These principles include: (a) The applicant for leave must demonstrate something more than that the trial judge was arguably wrong.

Original sentence: Question: In the case of Dowsett v King (No 2) [2020] NSWSC 6, what was the nature of Mrs Dowsett's claim and how did it relate to the court's jurisdiction?
Answer: In the case of Dowsett v King (No 2) [2020] NSWSC 6, Mrs Dowsett's claim was for a sum of $140,000 plus interest, which she argued was owed to her as a result of a breach of trust. However, the pleadings did not seek a declaration that a trust existed over that sum, but rather that Donna "pay" the sum to Mrs Dowsett. This suggested that Mrs Dowsett's monetary entitlement arose as a consequence of a breach of trust, which could be described as equitable compensation. According to the District Court Act, a claim for equitable compensation arising from a breach of trust falls within s 134(1)(e). However, because the proposed equitable claim in this case exceeded the $20,000 limit in that section, the District Court did not have jurisdiction to determine that claim as it was precluded from falling within the residual equitable jurisdiction in s 134(1)(h) of the Act.

Answer: According to the decision in Wyvill v Law Society Northern Territory [2019] FCA 2050, after completing an investigation of a complaint against an Australian legal practitioner, the Law Society must either start proceedings in the Disciplinary Tribunal under the relevant Chapter, dismiss the complaint under the same Chapter, or take action under section 499 of the Act.

However, the court did not suggest that any order for further provision is, or should be seen as, reparation or compensation for any such conduct in the past. Rather, it is an order that follows the evaluative process set out in the Succession Act.

Answer: In the case of Williams (formerly Turco) v Mortgage Ezy Australia Pty Ltd [2020] FCA 1567, the third ground of appeal was that the primary judge erred in law or in fact in holding that if the Appellant does succeed in the proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, the Appellant's ability to pay her debts would not be materially different.

Answer: In the case of Bindaree Beef Pty Ltd v Riley [2013] NSWCA 305, the Court of Appeal, with Chief Justice Bathurst and her Honour Justice Beazley, considered the meaning of "substantial and operative reason". They held that the question of whether the injury was a substantial and operative cause of the worker's dismissal is a question of fact to be decided by reference to all the circumstances, including the employer's evidence as to such cause. The term "operative" is not superfluous in the section, and there could be more than one cause for the dismissal. The presumption will be rebutted if it is shown that the injury is not a substantial cause and one that is operative on the decision-maker at the relevant time.

Original sentence: Question: In the case of Clurname Pty Limited v McGraw-Hill Financial, Inc [2017] FCA 1319, how did the court determine the location where a statement was made, when it was initiated in one place and received in another?
Answer: In the case of Clurname Pty Limited v McGraw-Hill Financial, Inc [2017] FCA 1319, the court determined the location where a statement was made by considering the events and asking where, in substance, the act took place. If a statement is directed from one place to another where it is known or even anticipated that it will be received by the plaintiff, the statement was, in substance, made at the place to which it was directed. This is true even if the statement is directed to a place from where it ought reasonably to be expected that it will be brought to the attention of the plaintiff, even if it is brought to attention in some third place. The court rejected the argument that the act took place in New York because that was the place where Standard & Poor’s determined its ratings methodologies, criteria and model assumptions. The court found that the relevant tortious conduct was Standard & Poor’s making the S&P Ratings Representations and the S&P Independence Representations in circumstances where it knew and authorised the communication of those representations to investors in Australia, or where it knew or could reasonably expect that the representations would be received and relied on by investors in Australia.

Answer: In the case of Searle v Transport for NSW [2017] NSWCATAD 256, it was found that the public interest considerations in favour of disclosing information about the Sydney Light Rail Delivery Office's problems with stakeholders outweighed the public interest considerations against such disclosure. This decision was made under the Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW), section 13. However, the decision was subject to a proviso that the court had not yet determined whether there was an overriding public interest against disclosure of the information identifying interviewees, which was contained in a schedule to each document. The court also found that the respondent, Transport for NSW, had not discharged its onus of demonstrating that there was an overriding public interest against disclosure of the information sought by Mr Searle.

Answer: In the case of NVP [2016] NSWCATGD 1, the Tribunal was puzzled because the cognitive impairment related to Huntington's disease is not a mental illness. This means that a patient cannot be made an involuntary patient under the Mental Health Act. The Mental Health Act limits the powers that the Tribunal can give a guardian for a person in a gazetted unit. If the unit was not gazetted, if appropriate, the Tribunal would have clear authority to give a guardian coercive powers in relation to accommodation and medical treatment decisions.

Answer: According to the decision in R v DX (No 2) [2011] NSWDC 165, the court should consider whether the document was made or written or verified by the witness as accurate at a time when the facts were fresh in the memory of the witness. This interpretation is supported by the Australian Law Reform Commission's Report (ALRC 26, volume 1, para 165). The court should be cautious of documents made many years after the events recorded, as they may not accurately reflect the witness's memory when the events were fresh.

Answer: In the case of Tyndall v ACN 062 895 774 Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 102, it was observed that an intermediate court of appeal should consider several factors when deciding whether to grant a stay or injunction. These include the prospects of success in the case, the likelihood of a grant of special leave, and whether a successful appeal would make any practical difference to the rights and interests of the appellant unless a stay or injunction was granted. The court should also consider the effect of not granting a stay or an injunction on the rights, obligations, or interest of the putative appellant. One of the formulations adopted in certain circumstances is that of preserving the subject matter of the litigation.

Answer: In the case of Stevanovic v Stjelja & Ors [1999] NSWSC 29, the court awarded damages against the defendants based on their respective responsibilities for the plaintiff's condition. The first defendants were considered to have a considerably higher responsibility, and were therefore ordered to pay $100,000. The second defendant was ordered to pay $40,000. The third defendant's liability was determined under the Act, with the plaintiff entitled to 16% of the maximum amount under s79(3) of the Act. The maximum amount was $250,000, 16% of which is $40,000. After a deduction of $20,500 in accordance with s79(5), the resultant figure was $19,500. Half the amount awarded against the first defendants was considered referable to the past and attracted interest at the usual rate of 2%. The awards against the second and third defendants did not attract interest, as per s35D(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act 1942 and s73(3) of the Motor Accidents Act respectively.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of New South Wales law, under what circumstances can a party withdraw an admission they have made in court?
Answer: According to the decision in SLE Worldwide v WGB & Ors [2005] NSWSC 816, a party can withdraw an admission they have made in court under certain circumstances. If a party without any apparent disability makes a clear and distinct admission that is accepted by its opponent and acted upon, an application to withdraw the admission should not be freely granted, especially at appeal. However, the question of whether to allow the withdrawal of an admission is one for the reviewing judge to consider in the context of each particular appeal. The general guideline is that the person seeking to withdraw a concession made should provide some good reason why the judge should disturb what was previously common ground or conceded. Furthermore, if a court is satisfied that admissions have been made after consideration and advice such as from the parties’ expert and after a full opportunity to consider its case and whether the admissions should be made, admissions so made with deliberateness and formality would ordinarily not be permitted to be withdrawn. The court will not lend its approval to the withdrawal of admissions where this is actuated by purely tactical reasons.

Original sentence: Question: In the case of Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community & Ors v The State of Victoria & Ors [1995] FCA 1173, what does section 84(2) of the Act provide for and what is the issue raised by the motions brought pursuant to this section?
Answer: In the case of Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community & Ors v The State of Victoria & Ors [1995] FCA 1173, section 84(2) of the Act provides that a person may seek leave of the Federal Court to be joined as a party to proceedings if the person's interests are affected by the matter or may be affected by a determination in the proceedings. The motions brought pursuant to this section raise the issue of whether the interests of those seeking leave to be joined as a party may be affected by a determination in the proceedings. To resolve this issue, it is necessary to consider the true construction of s 84(2) and to apply the subsection to the facts established in each case. The construction issue relates to the meaning of the words "the person's interests".

Answer: In the case of Soufflet Beheer v AWB Ltd (ACN 081 890 459) [2006] FCA 51, the court explained that the fundamental distinction between accord executory and accord and satisfaction is that the former does not operate to discharge existing rights and duties unless and until the accord is performed, whereas the latter operates as a discharge immediately the accord (or agreement) is achieved. Accord and satisfaction is the compromise of an existing cause of action in return for a promise while accord executory requires that something be done before the cause of action is compromised.

Answer: In the case of State of New South Wales v Hill [2016] NSWSC 913, Dr Eagle expressed concern about the individual's risk of re-offending. Despite the individual's time in custody and under supervision, Dr Eagle noted that the individual still found it difficult to control his own actions and comply with the basic requirements of the supervision order. Dr Eagle suggested that if the supervision order was lifted, the individual might continue to engage in risky behaviour, such as substance use and exposure to vulnerable victims, potentially at a higher frequency. This could lead to a high risk of re-offending, particularly when the individual is intoxicated and his control is reduced.

Answer: In the case of Karras, Monserrat Gonzales v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs Cabal, Teresa Pasini v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1705, the decisions resulted in each applicant remaining in detention pending resolution of her application for a protection visa.

Original sentence: Question: What is the extent of government control over religious organisations in China as described in the case of Zhang v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1682?
Answer: In the case of Zhang v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1682, it was noted that the government control over religious organisations in China is primarily exercised through a registration process administered by the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau. This process allows the government to monitor membership in religious organisations, locations of meetings, selection of clergy, publication of religious materials, and funding for religious activities. The government also undertakes annual inspections of registered religious organisations. Failure to register can result in the imposition of fines, seizure of property, razing of ‘illegal’ religious structures, forcible dispersal of religious gatherings, and, occasionally, short term detention. While long-term imprisonment, violence and physical abuse by security forces against religious activists still occur, they appear to be less frequent than they were at the time of the first Human Rights Watch study of religion in China in 1992.

Original sentence: Question: In New South Wales, how is the percentage of permanent impairment directly attributable to a work-related injury calculated for psychiatric injuries according to the Guidelines made under s 376?
Answer: According to the Guidelines made under s 376, as referenced in the decision of Marks v Secretary, Department of Communities and Justice (No 2) [2021] NSWSC 616, the impairment caused by a work-related psychiatric injury is measured by a psychiatrist who calculates the proportion of whole person impairment (WPI) due to a pre-existing condition. This pre-existing impairment is calculated using the same method for calculating current impairment levels. The psychiatrist uses all available information to rate the injured worker’s pre-injury level of functioning in each of the areas of function. The percentage impairment is calculated using the aggregate score and median class score using a conversion table. The injured worker’s current level of WPI % is then assessed, and the pre-existing WPI % is subtracted from their current level, to obtain the percentage of permanent impairment directly attributable to the work-related injury.

Answer: In the case of Searle B A v Keayes P & Ors [1994] FCA 1063, Brisalebe's defence did not admit the matters alleged in the statement of claim and claimed that Brisalebe is entitled to 23 per cent of the capital of Brisalebe AG, a Swiss corporation.

Answer: In Leone v Minister for Home Affairs [2019] FCA 1610, the Tribunal did not consider the financial consequences to Alexia of her father’s deportation as a material factor in its decision. The Tribunal primarily focused on Alexia's emotional well-being and found that it would be in her best interests for Mr Leone’s visa cancellation to be revoked. The potential future financial assistance from Mr Leone to Alexia was not seen as a factor that could have realistically affected the Tribunal’s overall assessment.

Answer: In Sheather v R [2020] NSWCCA 162, the court considered the use of statistics in determining the sentence for the offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine under s 25 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act. The court referred to statistics as a blunt instrument and an opaque tool, particularly when there are a smaller number of cases making up the set. The court used the statistics as a yardstick to assess the proposed sentence but did not allow them to define the outer bounds of permissible discretion. The court was mindful to use the statistics in accordance with decisions such as Hili, Jones v R [2010] HCA 45 and Brown v R [2014] NSWCCA 215 at paras 80 to 80 per Garling J and more recently SS v R [2016] NSWCCA 197.

Answer: In the decision of Meaden v Bell Potter Securities Limited (No 4) [2012] FCA 1469, the court identified structural problems with paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the proposed subpoena. The court found it difficult to identify relevant documents as there were a number of preconditions to fall within paragraph 1. The documents had to be in some sense in respect of an investigation conducted by ASIC, and that investigation had to relate to either the respondent, its directors, its officers or its agents, recommending the acquisition of PGL shares during that period. The court found it difficult to see how sub-paragraphs 2(k), 2(l), 2(m), and the Roman numerals (i), (iv), and (v) could be a subset of a recommendation to acquire PGL shares. The court also questioned the relevance of these sub-paragraphs, such as the hiring of employees and how they relate to the pleaded issue.

Answer: In the case of Vumbaca v Sultana [2012] NSWDC 237, the document alleges that the Costs Review Panel and the Costs Assessor made several errors in law. These include failing to properly consider certain documents such as the Costs Agreement between Turner Freeman and Mr Spiro Tzouganatos, the Barrister it briefed to conduct the Defendant's case in the Dust Diseases Tribunal, and the Terms of Settlement that the Defendant entered into in the substantive proceedings in the Dust Diseases Tribunal. They also allegedly erred in not reversing the findings of the Costs Assessor, in circumstances where there was no evidence that the Defendant had paid the costs the subject of assessment or that a bill had been rendered to it for those costs. Furthermore, they are accused of failing to take into account the contents of the "Assessed Tax Invoice", dated 8 April 2011, issued by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. Lastly, they are said to have erred in assessing the costs by an "item by item" approach to the document headed, "PARTY/PARTY BILL OF COSTS", instead of assessing the entirety of the costs the subject of the Application.

The court also noted that the disclaimer at the bottom of the homepage of Digital Post Australia's website stating that it is not an Australia Post business should be considered.

Answer: In the case of BRZ17 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2019] FCA 677, it was established that in order to prove jurisdictional error arising from legal unreasonableness, the following steps are necessary: (a) the appellant must identify the alleged failure with precision; (b) the terms, scope and purpose of the statutory power that the IAA failed to consider must be examined; and (c) the alleged failure must be evaluated to see whether it has the character of being legally unreasonable, for example because it lacked a rational foundation or an evident or intelligible justification, or because it was plainly unjust, arbitrary, capricious or lacking in common sense.

Answer: In the case of Timberland Property Holdings Pty Ltd v Julie Bundy [2005] NSWCA 419, evidence was provided by Ms Danielli who described the car park as having a grease patch where the plaintiff's heel had slipped through. She noted that the lighting was "very dim, very dark" and the time was "about 4 in the afternoon" on a stormy and "quite cloudy" day.

Answer: In the case of Piatti v ACN 000 246 542 Pty Ltd [2020] NSWCA 168, the court interprets the use of tenses in section 15B as a way to assess the conditions for an award of damages.

Despite the use of tenses in section 15B being considered clumsy, the court believes that this is how the section must be read.

Answer: In Buckley v R [2021] NSWCCA 6, the court did not find the applicant's mental health issues, including schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression, to lessen his moral culpability for the offences he committed, as there was no evidence that these issues were causally related to his offending.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of Australian Corporations Law, is the requirement of exact coincidence of date for verification of the statutory demand considered an essential integer of a demand?
Answer: In the case of Dolvelle v Australian Macfarms Pty Limited (1998) 43 NSWLR 717; 28 ACSR 175, it was held that the requirement of exact coincidence of date for verification of the statutory demand, though important, was not to be treated as such an essential integer of a demand that its absence meant that there was no demand at all. This view was influenced by the reference in the Corporations Act that includes within the concept of a "demand" one that is a "purported demand". However, this conclusion was drawn in the context of winding up proceedings where it was no longer open to set aside the statutory demand, and the presumption of insolvency had already arisen. It does not necessarily apply to a timely application to set aside a demand.

Answer: In the case of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 12, the High Court, by majority, held that the Tribunal had erred by not making findings on Mrs Khawar's claims. Mrs Khawar, a Pakistani woman, had applied for a protection visa, claiming that her husband had assaulted her violently on multiple occasions and that her complaints to the police were not seriously entertained. The Tribunal had determined that even if Mrs Khawar’s version of the facts was accepted, she would not have established that she was a member of a particular social group. The High Court disagreed, stating that if the facts were as alleged by Mrs Khawar, she may have established membership of a particular social group. Gleeson CJ even suggested that it would be open to the Tribunal to conclude that women in Pakistan are a particular social group.

Answer: According to the decision in Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2003] FCA 388, there is a distinction between the purpose of a provision and its effect or likely effect. The purpose to which a provision refers is the subjective purpose of those engaging in the relevant conduct. The effect or likely effect of a provision is to be determined by reference to what can reasonably be expected to be its consequences. The term "likely", as used in this context, means a real chance or possibility, rather than more likely than not. The purpose or effect of a provision is to be assessed at the time the agreement is made or the provision comes into effect.

Answer: In the case of EHT17 v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs [2020] FCA 309, the appellant argued that his migration agent had mistakenly stated in his visa application that his parents were dual citizens.

He also claimed that the two extracts were mistaken in stating his place of birth as Tartous and that his father did not have Syrian citizenship or identification documents. The appellant reasserted that he was a Lebanese and not a Syrian citizen. He explained that his adverse admissions to his Honour occurred because he was scared and that that had been his first time in court, but that he was telling the truth about his heritage.

Answer: In the case of Li v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1527, the Tribunal expressed skepticism towards the applicant's allegations of domestic violence due to several reasons. These included inconsistencies in the applicant’s account of events reported by Senior Detective Searle, the absence of any complaint of sexual assault when the applicant first spoke to the police, the absence of any medical evidence to support her account of sexual assault, and allegations by the person who accompanied her to the police station that she had been lying. The Tribunal also referred to a statement of Senior Detective Searle doubting the validity of the applicant’s allegations and concluded that the applicant had made them against the nominator in order to remain in Australia. The Tribunal also found no evidence of complaints of violence to the applicant’s friends, was critical of the evidence of the psychologist, and gave little weight to the applicant’s reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety.

Answer: According to the decision in the matter of Techfire NSW Pty Ltd [2020] NSWSC 1206, an order for indemnity costs can be made when the Court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to have subjected the defendant to the expenditure of costs. This is not done to punish an unsuccessful plaintiff for persisting with a case that fails, but to compensate a successful defendant fully for costs incurred. Whether an indemnity costs order should be made depends, at least in part, on whether there was a relevant delinquency on the part of the unsuccessful party.

Answer: Under the Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994 (WA), regulations may be made to provide for a levy, which may be of the nature of a tax, to be payable to the State for the costs of administering the Work Health and Safety Act 2020 in relation to mines and mining operations.

Answer: In the matter of Leroy (Trustee), in the matter of Vitale and Vitale (Bankrupts) [2016] FCA 999, Mr Leroy sought several declarations. Firstly, he sought a declaration that the issue of units in the Vitale Future Generation Trust was beyond power and void. Secondly, he argued that the loan by Vitale Future Generations to Mr and Mrs Vitale to fund the subscription for those units was therefore void, or failed because there was a total failure of consideration. Thirdly, he sought a declaration that the mortgage granted by Mrs Vitale, purportedly to secure the purported loan to Vitale Future Generations, did not secure any debt or obligation, and was accordingly void or should be set aside. His case was not based on the contention that the loan and mortgage were entered into to defraud or defeat creditors, but rather that the issue of the units was not provided for, or properly provided for, in the trust deed, and was therefore beyond power. As a result, the loan that was purportedly made to fund the subscription for those units failed for want of consideration, as did the mortgage that purportedly secured it.

Answer: In Wu v R [2016] NSWCCA 96, the Crown conceded that one might infer that the discount given for past assistance in Mr Wu’s case was 5%. However, they argued that even if the relevant discount was 5% for past assistance and 5% for future assistance, this does not demonstrate that there was an error in the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion. The Crown's submission was that, had the judge given a greater discount for the combined assistance and plea, it nevertheless could not have led to a situation where no custodial sentence was imposed at all because that would fail to reflect the principle of general deterrence. The Crown also pointed to the need for the discounted sentence not to be disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender. They argued that it is both artificial and wrong in principle for Mr Wu to seek to demonstrate error by dissecting the combined discount into percentages that were purportedly allowed for the guilty pleas and for assistance.

It was stated that no conclusion of negligence could be arrived at until, first, the mind conceives affirmatively what should have been done. In other words, before there can be a conclusion that a respondent has failed to exercise due care and skill there must be an identification of what a reasonable person in the same position of the respondent would have done. This involves identifying, with some precision, what a reasonable person in the position of the defendant would do by way of response to the reasonably foreseeable risk.

The court also noted that there is no deception between the bank and the customer in such cases, as the bank has credited certain funds to the account and the customer was entitled to withdraw those funds.

Answer: In Steinberg v Mosman Municipal Council [2008] NSWLEC 63, the court decided that the proposed balcony extension could maintain its alignment with the existing balcony. The court reached this conclusion because it believed that the benefits from the proposed modified screen would sufficiently overcome any adverse impacts that might result from the intensive use of the extended part of the balcony. The court also took into account that the use of this part of the balcony in a manner that might adversely affect the neighbour’s amenity was unlikely to occur on an unacceptably frequent basis. Therefore, the court upheld the appeal and decided to amend the development consent as sought by the applicant.

The Tribunal also found that even if the appellant continued with the ANP, the chance he would be seriously harmed by the Taliban or other terrorist groups for reasons of his actual or imputed political opinion or because he was Pashtun was remote.

Answer: In the case of Kostov v Gibson [2018] NSWSC 428, Ms Kostov sought an adjournment on the grounds that she needed more time to prepare to resist the defendants’ application for summary dismissal. She cited personal matters and the stress of litigation as reasons for needing more time. She also stated that she needed further time to prepare evidence and undertake research in relation to cases that might support her contention that the defence of absolute privilege is not absolute. However, the court found that Ms Kostov had had a reasonable amount of time to prepare to resist this application and that granting further time would be futile, given the absolute privilege attaching to Judge Gibson's judgments and their publication. The court was satisfied that Ms Kostov had had a more than reasonable opportunity to prepare to meet an argument based on what it considered a fatal flaw in her proceedings.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of New South Wales planning law, under what circumstances would a court not interfere with a council's decision regarding development consent?
Answer: According to the decision in Hunter Valley Vineyards Association & Anor v Council of the City of Cessnock & Ors [1988] NSWLEC 20, a court in New South Wales would not interfere and declare invalid a decision of a council regarding development consent if the decision is one which was reasonably open to the council to make. This is based on the principle that Parliament has entrusted to elected local government bodies the function of administering the planning laws of the State. Therefore, a court should not declare invalid a decision of a council which was reasonably open to it on the facts before it merely because the Court, on the facts before the Court, would have reached a different conclusion.

Answer: In the case of Yildiz v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2021] FCA 1550, the Tribunal found that while it was satisfied that the complainant and his wife did not sign the forms that were submitted to the Department, it was unable to form any conclusive views as to whether the applicant had forged the signatures, and therefore made no finding that the applicant had breached clause 2.9 of the Code by forging signatures. However, the Tribunal found that the applicant had not dealt with the complainant competently, diligently and fairly in all aspects of her handling of the application, and had breached clause 2.1 of the Code. The Tribunal also found that the applicant had misled the Authority in its investigation in respect of information about an application that she had made in Turkey on behalf of the complainant, breaching clause 2.9A of the Code. Furthermore, based upon evidence of WhatsApp messages passing between the applicant and the complainant’s brother, the Tribunal found that the applicant had attempted to coerce and intimidate the complainant, by threatening him through his brother, in order to have the complainant withdraw his complaint against her, breaching clause 2.15 of the Code.

Answer: In the case of Hunter v Sutherland Shire Council [2008] NSWLEC 1115, the court raised several concerns about the proposed subdivision. The court was not satisfied that the subdivision would provide for appropriate future development. The court also considered the site's capacity and capability of accommodating a dwelling envisaged and contemplated by council’s planning controls, including the existing 2000 LEP and the 2006 zone objectives for the area. The court also noted that while one does not necessarily need to screen out built forms in an environmentally sensitive area, canopy trees must be able to filter the visibility of built forms from the waterway. The court also took into account the engineer’s evidence that there would be up to 6 metres of excavation required over the site and the gradients over various parts of the site. The court also noted that the site very steeply rises from the end of Boomerang Avenue and that for the minimum width, it is also important in the circumstances of this case that there be a greater width to allow for a greater setback to the street than that proposed in the concept dwelling which has a 3.5 metres setback. The court concluded that this would not have the ameliorative effect of providing a landscaped setting or a suitable landscaped setting contemplated by council’s controls.

Answer: In the case of Luo v Jemmeson & Fisher Solicitors & Accountants [2017] NSWCATCD 33, the issue regarding the payment of stamp duty arose when Mr Luo's parents, who were Chinese citizens with Australian visas, were involved in a property purchase. The initial stamp duty assessment was made on the basis that all purchasers were Australian citizens or permanent residents. However, Mr Luo later informed Elizabeth, presumably a representative of Jemmeson & Fisher Solicitors & Accountants, that his parents were not Australian citizens. This led to a discussion about the potential liability for Surcharge Purchaser Duty unless certain exemptions were met. Elizabeth responded that Mr Luo should have instructed her to give advice about this before signing the contract or when he first spoke to her.

Original sentence: Question: What changes were made to Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in New South Wales after 1 February 2003?
Answer: After 1 February 2003, Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in New South Wales was amended to prescribe a different manner of imposing sentences for offences. The new form of the section requires the court first to set a non-parole period and then the balance of the term of the sentence. The balance must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless special circumstances justify it. This is a change from the old form of the section, which required the court to set the term of the sentence and then to set a non-parole period, with the non-parole period having to be not less than three quarters of the term of the sentence unless special circumstances justified its being less. This was established in the decision Regina v HALA aka BLACK [2004] NSWCCA 329.

Answer: In the case of Meeuwissen v Boden, Basten JA made several observations about the operation of s 63 of the Act. These observations, as summarised in Cowcher v Allianz Australia Insurance Limited [2019] NSWSC 572, include: 1. The medical assessment, not the resulting certificate, must be incorrect in a material respect; 2. The phrase 'in a material respect' is less precise than 'capable of having a material effect on the outcome of the previous assessment', which is the language of s 62(1A); 3. The power given to the Proper Officer is not discretionary, meaning that once the relevant matter is satisfied, the Proper Officer must arrange for the application to be referred to a medical panel; 4. The Proper Officer must be satisfied not that the medical assessment was incorrect in a material respect, but only that there is reasonable cause to suspect that it was. This language does not require the Proper Officer to carry out an assessment or calculation, but rather to identify possible error.

Answer: In the case of Chong v R [2011] NSWCCA 182, the court considered several factors in determining Ms. Chong's sentence. These included her personal history, her addiction to a severely mind-altering substance, her clouded judgment, the emotional pressure placed on her, and her lack of understanding and rationalisation of her actions. The court also took into account the lack of substantial planning, lack of a cover story, the lack of sophistication about the whole operation, and the fact that she was carrying drugs in her own handbag. Her past record was also considered, but it did not entitle her to any particular leniency. The court also considered the amount of drug imported and the issue of general deterrence.

Answer: In the case of Hale v Mosman Council [2007] NSWLEC 788, the issue was an appeal against an order under s121B of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. The order was made in respect of an unauthorised screen and fence attached to the top of the tennis court fence at the western side of the allotment at 18 Burrawong Avenue, Mosman. The screen and fence in question was an extension, about 20m long, which brought the existing 3.6m height of the fence to 5m above the level of the tennis court. The entire structure was lined with a synthetic material called “instant picket hedge”.

Answer: In Prodanovich v Mukherjee [2013] NSWSC 1833, the issue with the judgment that was entered by consent between the Plaintiff and the Second Defendant was that the First Defendant was not consulted about the entry of judgment. The High Court in James Hardie & Co v Seltsam Pty Ltd (1998) 196 CLR 53, made clear that another party to the proceedings was entitled to be notified and, if necessary, heard on any application for a judgment that would preclude that party from pursuing the Defendant against whom judgment was to be entered in their favour. The Second Defendant did not oppose the judgment being set aside and, in fact, consented to that course. The Plaintiff also did not oppose the judgment being set aside but was not in a position to consent to the judgment being set aside due to the legal advisers' view that they did not have reasonable prospects of success against the Second Defendant.

Answer: In the case of Gao v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Zhu) [2002] FCA 1363, the applicant sought the removal of the trustee under s 156A(4) of the Act on the ground that the trustee was dealing with the bankrupt’s property otherwise than in the interests of the unsecured creditors. The applicant's complaint was that the trustee was "transferring" to the Bank the trustee’s power to sell the property or "instructing" the Bank to sell it. The court dismissed this complaint as misconceived, stating that there was no prospect of the applicant obtaining this aspect of the relief sought. The court also noted that Section 156A(4) does not apply to the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy, but only to registered trustees.

Answer: In the case of Australian Medico-Legal Group Pty Ltd v Claireleigh Mosman Pty Ltd [2017] NSWCA 218, the court considered the communications between the borrower and the director as the most important factor in determining the identity of the lender.

Answer: In the case of Australian Solar Mesh Sales Pty Ltd v Anderson, Neville John & Ors [1997] FCA 1432, the court decided to handle the motion for costs as if the transfers of shares had not occurred and the shareholding was as it stood when the proceedings commenced. The court reasoned that the shareholders existing at the commencement of the proceedings, other than Mr Ivory, either have no interest in the applicant company or this litigation or that what occurred is a mere ploy to bring about the situation whereby it would appear that the applicant and the one shareholder in the company was insolvent, so that the applicant could rely upon the poverty rule. On this basis, it was not shown that security could not be provided. Indeed, even at that time, it was not shown that Mr & Mrs Smith, who remain as shareholders, were not in a position to offer security.

Answer: In the case of Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, New South Wales Branch (On Behalf of B Winiorczyk and others) v Ace Scaffolding Pty Ltd [2004] NSWIRComm 13, section 210(2) of the Act was referred to as a presumption that can be rebutted if the respondent "satisfies the Commission that the alleged matter was not a substantial and operative cause of the detrimental action".

Original sentence: Question: In the case of Ridolfi v Hammond [2012] NSWCA 3, what was the court's view on the appellant's decision not to undergo recommended surgery for his degenerative condition?
Answer: In Ridolfi v Hammond [2012] NSWCA 3, the court did not find the appellant's decision to refuse surgery for his degenerative condition unreasonable. The court did not believe that this decision ended any causal relationship that existed between the accident and the appellant's incapacity for work in November 2008. Furthermore, the court did not intend to convey that the appellant was solely responsible for his deteriorating condition due to his refusal to undertake the surgery. The court acknowledged that while doctors may recommend major surgery to arrest a progressive condition, it is another matter to characterise a refusal to undergo the surgery as unreasonable, especially when the surgery carries significant inherent risks and may produce serious complications later on.

Answer: In the case of 88 Gregory Pty Ltd v Randwick City Council [2018] NSWLEC 1020, the court did not accept the suggestion of reducing the building height by 500mm to retain the views of the neighbours. The court found that the rear portion of the building would have to be reduced in height by at least 700mm and perhaps up to 1m to retain the current views from the ground floor living areas of the neighbouring dwellings. However, this would require excessive excavation, contrary to the DCP controls, and would result in poor amenity to the occupants of the dwelling due to the height of retaining walls that would be required. The court deemed the impacts of such a wall to be unacceptable if the site was excavated by a further 700 to 1000mm.

Answer: In the decision of SafeWork NSW v Astute Earth Works Pty Ltd [2023] NSWDC 12, it was noted that constraining a party to cross-examine a witness by video link may sometimes involve a degree of unfairness, depending on the circumstances of the case. Relevant circumstances may include the importance of the witness, whether the witness's credibility was in issue, the nature and extent of documents involved, whether translation of documents or oral evidence is necessary, time differences in the other forum, and the quality of technology. In certain cases, depriving the cross-examiner of the reassurance that the gravity and immediacy of the moment, and of the supervising presence of the judge, are not lost on the witness and the cross-examination is not thereby rendered any less effective, to the possible prejudice of the cross-examining party, may also work relevant unfairness.

Similarly, the fact that Tindall was the sole director and secretary of the fourth defendant, Jadam, was not a sufficient basis for a winding up order. The court stated that more evidence would be needed to justify such an order. While the court accepted that winding up was almost inevitable in the long run, it did not believe it should be ordered at that time due to insufficient evidence.

Answer: In the case of BWO18 v Minister for Home Affairs [2020] FCA 329, the issue on appeal was whether the Federal Circuit Court should have held that the Immigration Assessment Authority erred in assuming that the information it relied on was not "new information" as defined in section 473CD of the Act. The appellant argued that the information was "new" because it was not mentioned, discussed, commented upon, considered, or referred to, in the delegate's decision, despite the information being contained in publications cited in footnotes to the delegate’s reasons. The scope of material which may be considered by the Immigration Assessment Authority on a fast track review is limited by Subdivision B and C of Division 3 of Part 7AA (comprising sections 473DB-473DF). The effect of these provisions is that the Immigration Assessment Authority conducts the fast track review on the papers by reference to the material before the Minister (or the Minister’s delegate) subject to an exception pursuant to which the Immigration Assessment Authority may consider new information under section 473DC only where the criteria in section 473DD are met. The appeal was dismissed.

Original sentence: Question: In the case of Brebrich as Trustee for S & A Superannuation Fund v Maxpower Mortgage Services Pty Limited [2008] NSWSC 454, what was the defendant's argument regarding the non-redemption of units and the damages claim?
Answer: In the case of Brebrich as Trustee for S & A Superannuation Fund v Maxpower Mortgage Services Pty Limited [2008] NSWSC 454, the defendant argued that all documents in their possession had been produced as required by the orders. They noted that some documents were in the custody of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. They pointed out that the unit certificate the plaintiffs obtained referred to the trust deed and that the plaintiffs had invested in a unit trust. By definition, a unit trust requires a deed regulating the respective rights and obligations of unit holders and the trustee. The trust deed specifies that the trustee is entitled to refuse to redeem units in its discretion (cl 8(b)). The trustee’s reasons for not doing so in this case were clear; there were no funds available. With respect to the damages claim, cl 14 of the trust deed operates. There was no pleading or evidence relating to alleged misleading or deceptive conduct or in relation to any alleged breach of requirements for a managed investment scheme. Accordingly, the declarations and orders sought could not be made.

Answer: In the case of Su v Agarwal [2023] NSWCATAP 92, the grounds of appeal were as follows: 
1. Procedural unfairness: the tenant was significantly disadvantaged by the landlord’s managing agent appearing in person when the hearing was notified to be by AVL, the AVL did not work and the hearing continued with the tenant on an indistinct telephone line where he could not properly hear and be heard and through this spoke over other speakers; partly from the difficulties, the primary member hearing the matter favoured the person physically present and effectively advised him on case presentation. 
2. The primary member simply accepted at face value quotations and the landlord’s evidence without dealing with the absence of supporting evidence (such as photographs and actual expenditure) of actual damage and saying why he did not accept the competing photographic and other evidence. 
3. The primary member accepted the landlord’s evidence on rent without saying why, if the landlord had a new tenancy in place from 9 September 2022, the landlord should receive rent from then to 11 September 2022 from the tenant. 
In substance, these grounds raised questions of law in the form of alleged procedural unfairness and alleged absence of proper reasons. The same arguments were also put forward as the reasons for a grant of leave to appeal for alleged errors of fact that made the decision against the weight of evidence and not fair and equitable.

Answer: In R v Rodney BOATSWAIN [2015] NSWSC 878, the court found it difficult to assess the strength of the Crown's case without conducting a more detailed inquiry into the material and evidence available concerning Mr Boatswain’s car and its movements as well as scrutinising the evidence given by Ms Dawson’s neighbours. The court concluded that the Crown case appears to be reasonably strong but certainly not overwhelming. It was also noted that the Crown has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

Answer: In the case of Krishnan v Estee Lauder Pty Ltd [2022] FCA 273, Ms Krishnan alleged that the 'CABS 3 set system' was advertised on eight Australian websites, including the Clinique Australia website and several third-party sites. She claimed that these websites inconsistently listed the ingredients of the product, with some including salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, and others not listing the ingredients at all. However, she did not allege that Clinique was obliged to disclose all ingredients or that it was responsible for the marketing decisions made by third parties on their websites. Ms Krishnan also alleged that the 'Acne Solutions treatment' products, which contain salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, were being advertised and sold on five Australian websites, despite being meant for sale in the United States and Canada only. However, there was no evidence that these products were in fact sold in Australia.

Answer: In Whitfield v State of NSW (NSW Police Force) [2011] NSWADT 265, Constable Lobb, who was medically retired and appeared to be suffering from a back injury, gave evidence. He admitted that he had suggested to Mr Whitfield that he should move to a caravan park, a detail that was not included in the COPS report. His testimony was criticised as being bland and formulaic, with little effort made to recollect the relevant events. However, the court did not fully agree with this characterisation, noting that while the COPS entry was generally accurate, it omitted critical detail about whether he or Mrs 't Hart conveyed to Mr Whitfield that he should move out and the vehemence with which that message was conveyed.

Answer: In the case of Police V Dare [2010] NSWLC 23, the applicant was charged with firing a firearm with disregard for the safety of the victims. The categorisation of the objective seriousness of this offence was a matter for the evaluation of the sentencing judge. It was difficult to categorise the offence as a worst case given the range of offences covered by the provisions of s93G(1)(c). The offence charged was of firing a firearm “with disregard for the safety of any other person”, and not of firing it in a manner likely to injure or endanger the safety of such a person, offences which also fell within s93G and which were inherently more serious than that with which the Applicant was charged.

Answer: In the case of Insurance Australia Limited trading as NRMA Insurance v Helou; Helou v NRMA Insurance Australia Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1451, the Assessor made several errors of law. These included: a. The Assessor's refusal to apportion Mr Helou’s disability referable to his cervical and lumbar spine, in circumstances where he was obliged, as a matter of law, to do so in order to work out the appropriate quantum of damages to which the defendant was entitled; b. The assessment of damages for future care was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker could have arrived at it, indicating that the Assessor failed to discount damages for future care by reference to his finding; c. The Assessor purported to base his finding that the subject motor vehicle accident made a material contribution to Mr Helou’s lumbar spine condition on the opinion of Associate Professor Sheridan, when such opinion was either irrelevant to such finding because it did not address the question, or by its silence, provided some support for the contrary proposition; d. The Assessor based his finding that the subject motor vehicle accident made a material contribution to Mr Helou’s lumbar spine condition on an erroneous reading of Dr Couch, the MAS Assessor.

Answer: In the case of Cominos v Cominos [1972] HCA 54, the invalidity of the challenged provisions was asserted on the ground that each of them purported to confer upon the Court a power or function which is non-judicial. It was argued that it is beyond the competence of the Parliament of the Commonwealth to confer such a power or function upon the Supreme Courts of the States. The respondent's counsel submitted that the powers conferred by the challenged provisions are not within the scope of judicial power because the discretion given to the court is so complete and unfettered that it may be said that the legislature has attempted to delegate to the court a legislative function. It was further argued that judicial power cannot be exercised unless what the court may do is governed and bounded by some ascertainable test or standard.

Original sentence: Question: Under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1970 (Tas), what is the process for declaring a private nature reserve in Tasmania?
Answer: Under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1970 (Tas), the Governor of Tasmania, acting with the advice of the Executive Council and on the recommendation of the Minister, can declare a land to be a private nature reserve with the consent of the land owner. This declaration is made under section 14A of the Act. The land to be reserved is specified in a schedule to the proclamation. The reserved land is also given a name. However, the proclamation does not take effect until it is registered in accordance with section 16A of the Act. An example of this process can be seen in the proclamation made on 6 September 1999, where the land was declared as the Long Spit Private Nature Reserve.

Answer: According to the decision in Yango Pastoral Co Pty Ltd v First Chicago Australia Ltd [1978] HCA 42, if a contract that a plaintiff seeks to enforce is expressly, or by implication, forbidden by the statute or common law, no court will lend its assistance to give it effect. This is particularly the case where the consideration for the promise or the act to be done was illegal, as being against the express provisions of the law, or contrary to justice, morality and sound policy. However, if the consideration and the matter to be performed are both legal, a plaintiff has not been precluded from recovering by an infringement of the law, not contemplated by the contract, in the performance of something to be done on his part.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of Australian law, how can the courts balance the need for procedural fairness with the need to keep sensitive information confidential?
Answer: According to the decision in HT v The Queen [2019] HCA 40, there is a distinction to be drawn between a court having jurisdiction and the exercise of that jurisdiction. The question in cases of this kind is how power should be exercised. It should not be assumed that procedural fairness should altogether be denied in order to keep sensitive information confidential. The courts have modified and adapted the content of the general rules of open justice and procedural fairness in particular kinds of cases. Orders for non-publication and the non-disclosure of evidence in wardship cases are examples of this. More relevant for present purposes is litigation concerning trade secrets where disclosure is sometimes limited, for example with "confidentiality rings" being placed around disclosure and the persons who are permitted to see the confidential material. Each case has to be decided on its own facts and on the broad principle that the court has the task of deciding how justice can be achieved taking into account the rights and needs of the parties. The relevant party should have as full a depth of disclosure as would be consistent with the adequate protection of the secret.

Original sentence: Question: In New South Wales, can a valid contract for the sale of land be silent about the date for completion?
Answer: Yes, in New South Wales, a valid contract for the sale of land can be silent about the date for completion. This is because a valid "open contract" for the sale of land can be brought into existence provided the parties have agreed upon the bare minimum essentials, such as the identity of the vendor and purchaser, the description of the land, and the purchase price. Where the contract is silent, the fixing of a date for completion is part of the common law and is a matter which arises after the title had been accepted or after the inquiry as to title. This was discussed in the decision of Hills Central Pty Limited v Anthony Gerard Hagerty & Catherine Elizabeth Hagerty t/a the Executors of the Estate of the late Gladys Delores Hagerty [2018] NSWSC 789.

Answer: According to the decision in R v Glenn (a pseudonym) [2015] NSWSC 1888, in New South Wales, a reference to an Act or instrument in any Act or instrument extends to the other Act or instrument, as in force for the time being. This applies whether or not the reference includes a reference to subsequent amendments of the Act or instrument.

Answer: In the case R v Feroz; R v Ho; R v Hoang; R v Nguyen; R v Trinh [2020] NSWSC 341, it was noted that Mr Nguyen's criminal behaviour was influenced by several factors. These included his traumatic family background, dislocation during his teenage years, and an incident where he was shot in a bar in Marrickville. These experiences led to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as flashbacks, hypervigilance, diminished impulse control, a loss of trust in others, and anticipatory anxiety and depression. These symptoms were not treated, leading him to use drugs. His character trait of being "easily led by others in adverse peer group situations" was also reflected in his conduct.

Answer: In the case of Regina v Moussad [1999] NSWCCA 337, the Crown argued that Walsh had dishonestly claimed incapacity for work and maintained this claim by presenting medical certificates and receiving payments under the statute. The Crown contended that this amounted to a single, comprehensive false pretence of incapacity for work. However, Justices Gaudron and Gummow interpreted the statute differently. They held that Walsh had not been charged with any offence created by the statute because the section created a discrete offence upon the receipt of any one payment or benefit. These words did not encompass multiple payments or benefits. Justice Kirby, the other member of the majority, agreed, stating that the Act under which Walsh was charged clearly contemplated that obtaining each payment or benefit was a separate offence.

Answer: In the case of Inspector Dall v Caines [2011] NSWIRComm 166, the counsel for the prosecutor argued that the offence created by s 136 and in particular sub-section (1)(b) was, at least, within the second category as referred to in the judgment of R v Wampfler (1987) 11 NSWLR 541 at 546. This category is an offence where mens rea will be presumed to be present unless and until material is advanced by the defence of the existence of an honest and reasonable belief that the conduct in question is not criminal. In such a case, the prosecution must undertake the burden of negating such belief beyond reasonable doubt. It was also argued that the s 136(1)(b) offence could potentially fall within the third category identified in Wampfler, namely, it was an offence in which mens rea played no part and where guilt was established by proof of the objective ingredients of the offence. The counsel continued to submit that this offence was not in the first category where there was an original obligation on the prosecution to prove mens rea.

Answer: In the case of CBL v Southern Cross University [2017] NSWCATAD 125, the Respondent's position was that the discretion under subsection 53(4) should not be exercised in circumstances where alternative remedies could be more properly utilised. The Respondent submitted that this was one of the circumstances where an appeal under Part 6 was the more appropriate procedure. The Respondent also argued that as the decisions that CBL complains of are interlocutory decisions, and final decisions have been made in the proceedings, the appropriate process was for CBL to appeal the final decisions.

Answer: In the decision of KRM v The Queen [2001] HCA 11, the Court identified several risks associated with the trial of a relationship offence. These include the fact that evidence often comprises nothing more than the accusation of the complainant and the denial of the accused, and that the accused, who stands in peril of a conviction and who, if convicted, will almost certainly be deprived of liberty, cannot easily present an effective defence without specific details of dates and circumstances. The Court also noted the additional risk that, without clear directions, the jury may confuse the evidence relevant to any particular charges with that relevant to the relationship offence; that they may impermissibly use evidence of uncharged acts tendered to support the relationship offence; or that they may reason that, because the accused is guilty of one or more of the specified offences, that therefore he or she is guilty of the relationship offence or from such proof might reason that he or she is the kind of person who would conduct the relationship the subject of the offence and therefore did so as charged.

Answer: In the context of sentencing in New South Wales, as per the decision in Camilleri v R [2023] NSWCCA 106, the court should take into account the mental condition of the offender. This includes considering principles from Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194 at 43 [177]. The court should consider all relevant sentencing factors, including any significant mental illness from which an offender was suffering in assessing objective seriousness. This could include determining whether the actions were planned or spontaneous or arose from a complete loss of control due to the mental illness. However, the court must also have due regard to the basis of the conviction, such as s 23A of the Crimes Act. The extent of the mental illness or cognitive impairment may also influence the sentencing.

Original sentence: Question: What is the psychological profile of the defendant in the case of State of New South Wales v O’Hara (Final) [2022] NSWSC 155?
Answer: In the case of State of New South Wales v O’Hara (Final) [2022] NSWSC 155, the defendant is described as having entered the criminal justice system at a young age and having spent the majority of his life in custody. He has used violence as a means of survival and as a coping strategy. He reacts to perceived injustices and challenges with reduced self-regulation. He has a low level of education, no significant employment history, and a history of substance use. He self-discloses a constant state of anger and heightened hypervigilance, suspicion, and defensiveness, which have contributed to his cycle of violent offending. These traits are likely underpinned by a personality dysfunction typified by antisocial traits. His trauma response and violent tendencies have been reinforced through his experiences. He has not yet developed a sense of identity outside the prison context, has limited exposure to life in the community, and lacks understanding of potential triggers, stressors or challenges in this setting, and how to respond. He is likely to respond with violence without adequate outlets and ways to identify and manage hypervigilance and perceived threats. He has not yet ascertained the level of assistance required to address trauma and alter his thinking. He presents with some longstanding cognitive distortions, some of which appear to be starting to shift but would benefit from further exploration and fostering.

Original sentence: Question: What is the definition of a surrogacy arrangement under the Surrogacy Act 2010 (NSW)?
Answer: Under the Surrogacy Act 2010 (NSW), a surrogacy arrangement is defined as either a pre-conception or post-conception agreement. A pre-conception surrogacy arrangement is an agreement where a woman agrees to become or try to become pregnant, and the parentage of the child born as a result of the pregnancy is to be transferred to another person or persons. A post-conception surrogacy arrangement is an agreement where a pregnant woman agrees that the parentage of a child born as a result of the pregnancy is to be transferred to another person or persons. The agreement that the parentage of a child is to be transferred to another person can be expressed in various ways, including consent to a parentage order, agreement that the child is to be treated as the child of another person, agreement that the custody of or parental responsibility for a child is to be transferred to another person, or agreement that the right to care for a child is to be permanently surrendered to another person. Other matters may also be dealt with in a surrogacy arrangement. A variation to a pre-conception surrogacy arrangement that is made after a woman who agrees to become pregnant or to try to become pregnant under the arrangement becomes pregnant is considered to be a part of the pre-conception surrogacy arrangement.

Answer: In the case of Oxford Street Holdings Pty Ltd v Mid-Coast Council [2019] NSWLEC 1283, Mr Nash argued that the proposed manufactured home estate would not have adequate transport services due to the lack of bus provision on weekends or public holidays, limited service during school holidays, and the limited number of sites within 400m of the bus stop. On the other hand, Mr Maberly-Smith argued that the development had been amended to include a 'community bus' and that the provisions of clause 9 of SEPP 36 state that a manufactured home estate must be provided with adequate transport services, which can be provided by private transport, public transport or a combination of both. He also referred to the Mid Coast Council's Caravan Park for Long Term Residence Policy, which permits such parks where the Council is satisfied that residents will have access to necessary services and facilities.

Original sentence: Question: In the case of Prodanovski v Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services [2017] NSWDC 43, what was Ms Davenport's argument regarding the interpretation of offences s18 and s35?
Answer: In the case of Prodanovski v Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services [2017] NSWDC 43, Ms Davenport argued that the offences s18 and s35 could be determined by looking at whether the taking of the lobsters was lawful at the time of taking. If it was, then any subsequent dealing with them, including Prodanovski’s possession of them, is not proscribed by either section. She asserted that "take" must mean the act of taking the lobster from the sea onto the Lochiel South. Since Brancatisano was a licensed fisherman working from a Licenced Fishing Vessel and was entitled to take lobster from the sea, Prodanovski could not reasonably have known that the fish had been illegally taken because the lobsters were not illegally taken. She also argued that the defence in regulation 18 applies, as Prodanovski acquired the fish from another person whose possession of the fish was lawful.

Answer: In the case of ELD18 v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs [2021] FCA 299, the appellant sought to raise a new ground of appeal, labelled as ground 2A. This ground argued that the primary judge erred by failing to find that the Authority engaged in irrational or illogical reasoning, or constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction or failed to carry out its statutory task by failing to consider relevant information. The appellant particularly pointed out that the Authority concluded that he had given "a number of variations" in his account of his kidnap and related events, and that these variations, along with the Authority's doubts about the appellant's account, led it to question the appellant's claim that he was kidnapped and held by the Taliban.

This is achieved by authorising and encouraging the proactive public release of government information by agencies, giving members of the public an enforceable right to access government information, and providing that access to government information is restricted only when there is an overriding public interest against disclosure. The Act should be interpreted and applied to further these objects, and the discretions conferred by the Act should be exercised to facilitate and encourage, promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost, access to government information.

Answer: In the case of Michael Trail (A Pseudonym) v Secretary, Department of Home Affairs [2023] FCA 1061, the third approach taken by the applicant was to acknowledge that reasonable but ultimately unsuccessful steps had been taken, but then identify an additional reasonable step that they considered was necessary for the relevant officer to take. This approach required the Court to assess whether failing to take the additional step was sufficient for it to conclude that the officer had breached their duty, in the context of all of the other steps taken by the officer. This approach was ultimately the one pursued by the applicant in this case.

Answer: In ZSJ v ZSK [2021] NSWCATAP 144, the CEO sought an order that the Appellant pay his costs of the appeal on the grounds that "special circumstances" were established. He contended that the Appellant conducted the proceedings in a way that unnecessarily disadvantaged him by making scandalous allegations about the Facility and, when requested, failing to withdraw those allegations. The CEO also asserted that the material filed by the Appellant in the appeal contained allegations which are factually inaccurate, serious in nature, were not raised in the proceedings at first instance and would cause detriment to the Facility. He pointed out that the Appellant posted a “scandalous and untrue review” of the Facility on its website two days before the hearing of the appeal. Furthermore, he noted that much of the material relied upon by the Appellant in the appeal was filed late, denying him the opportunity to respond.

Answer: In the case of R v James Nicholas Kontaxis [2016] NSWDC 199, the court considered several factors in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences. These included how the offences took place, over what period, with what degree of coercion, use of threats of pressure, and any immediate effect on the victim. The court also considered the degree to which the offender exploited the youth of the victim. Another relevant matter was the number of aggravating features present, with the general principle being that the more circumstances of aggravation are present, the more serious the offence. The Crown confirmed that the objective seriousness of the offending was, in the Crown’s submission, within the mid-range of offences pursuant to s 66C, if not above the mid-range.

Original sentence: Question: What does section 13 of the Administration and Probate Act 1903 include according to its natural meaning as interpreted in the case of Webb (Master-in-Equity of Victoria) v McCracken [1906] HCA 45?
Answer: In the case of Webb (Master-in-Equity of Victoria) v McCracken [1906] HCA 45, it was interpreted that section 13 of the Administration and Probate Act 1903, according to its natural meaning, includes property over which the deceased had a general power of appointment by will, property over which he had a general power of appointment by deed, and property in respect of which he might exercise his power of appointment either by will or by deed. The words are wide enough to cover property coming within any one of those three classes. The decision of the Privy Council in Commissioner of Stamp Duties v. Stephen is directly in point. Property of which a person can dispose by will and property of which he can dispose by deed are so nearly his own property that it is reasonable that the legislature should treat them as his own for the purpose of probate duty. Property appointed by will is assets for the payment of the appointor's debts.

Answer: In the decision of Guardian Assurance Company Limited v Condogianis [1919] HCA 33, it was established that since an insurance company frames its own policy, words its own questions, and makes its own stipulations, it must be bound to the exact question as put. This means that if the company puts in a stipulation that mere inaccuracy, however honest, will deprive the insured of any benefit, it must strictly adhere to the exact wording of the question. The Court emphasised that stretching points in favour of insurance companies could lead to insecurity for the insured, as insurance would itself become the greatest risk.

Answer: In the case of R v Jenkins; R v Clayton [2013] NSWDC 208, the court held that it would be an exceptional case in which a jury would not be allowed to separate when in deliberation. The court did not view this case as exceptional. The court also stated that no miscarriage of justice occurred in this case due to the separation of the jury, as it was a misunderstanding on the part of the court officer and possibly the jury. The court referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Tennant v R [2006] NSWCCA 208, where it was assumed that two of the jurors separated while the jury was deliberating. The court did not consider this to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

Answer: In the case of Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Zappia [2019] FCA 2152, the court decided that the settlement offer made by Mr Zappia was not a reason to refuse to set aside the composition. The Deputy Commissioner was correct in asserting that the settlement offer was potentially problematic as it would have involved the Deputy Commissioner receiving a payment greater than that available under the composition and the assignment of its debt to a third party. This would have undermined the good faith between creditors who are to be treated equally by the composition. The court also decided that the composition should be set aside because there is a real possibility that further investigation into the affairs of Mr Zappia in bankruptcy may yield a better return to creditors.

Original sentence: Question: In the case of Environment Protection Authority v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (the Ammonia Incident) [2014] NSWLEC 107, what were the factors considered by the court in determining the imposition of an appropriate sentence for Orica?
Answer: In the case of Environment Protection Authority v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (the Ammonia Incident) [2014] NSWLEC 107, the court considered several factors in determining the imposition of an appropriate sentence for Orica. These included Orica's environmental antecedents, its corporate character, and the likelihood of re-offending. The court noted that Orica's environmental antecedents meant it could not be said that Orica did not have any prior criminal record, which could have operated as a mitigating factor. However, Orica's recent investments in environmental improvements, community consultation and support programs were seen as evidence of its good corporate character. Furthermore, the court found that Orica had taken actions to minimise the chance of a similar incident occurring, suggesting a low likelihood of future re-offending. These factors were taken into account under sections 21A(3)(e), (f) and (g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

Answer: Under the Gas Supply Regulation 2007 (Qld), if subdivision 2 does not apply or if any steps required under the subdivision have been carried out or complied with, the Queensland Competition Authority (QCA) must first publish a draft report about the material issues for the proposed distribution network code and a draft of the proposed distribution network code on its website.

Answer: In the case of NADH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 830, the Tribunal found that it was reasonable for the applicants to relocate to Dhaka, Bangladesh. The Tribunal accepted independent evidence that conservative attitudes critical towards people having had a child prior to their marriage do not prevail in Dhaka and there was no evidence of legal consequences for pre-marital sexual relationships. The Tribunal found no real chance that the applicants would face serious harm for having had an illegitimate child. The Tribunal also found no support for the applicants' claim that they might face harm due to a potential rise in Islamic fundamentalism in Bangladesh. Therefore, the Tribunal concluded that the applicants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason if they were to travel to and reside in Bangladesh.

Answer: In the decision of Comcare v Maganga [2008] FCA 285, the test of relevance for the purpose of inspection is not confined to whether the documents in question will or may establish an inconsistent statement by a witness giving evidence in the proceedings or whether the documents themselves will prove a fact in issue. The Court may allow documents to be inspected if they are apparently relevant or are on the subject matter of the litigation or if they might be used for a legitimate forensic purpose in cross-examination. The documents, prima facie, were relevant to the claimed fourth injury which claim depended, in turn, on Mr Maganga’s credit.

Answer: In the case of REGINA v. AO [2003] NSWCCA 43, the sentencing judge determined the terms of detention for the offender by considering thirty-three counts arising out of twenty-two separate, serial and serious incidents. The judge applied the principles of totality and parity, deciding that all terms be served concurrently and made a finding of 'special circumstances' on each charge. The sentences were backdated to the date of arrest. The judge also allowed for 'maximum leniency' for a plea of guilty, noting that the pleas were entered at an early stage and the offender had genuinely expressed remorse. However, the leniency allowed for 'contrition' was not as great as that of his co-offenders because he did not nominate his co-offenders.

Answer: In the case of Fegan (nee Rozenauers) v Lane Cove Council [2016] NSWLEC 1171, it was outlined that when an agreement is reached under s 34(3) of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 in New South Wales, the presiding Commissioner has several responsibilities.

Answer: In the case of WorkPac Pty Ltd v Rossato [2020] FCAFC 84, WorkPac's withdrawal of a submission that Mr Skene did not have a firm advance commitment as to the duration of his employment or the days (or hours) he could work was referred to as a "concession". This implied that there had, as a matter of fact, been a firm advance commitment as to the duration of Mr Skene’s employment or the days (or hours) which he would work. This was significant as it contributed to the failure of WorkPac's challenge to the use by the Federal Circuit Court Judge of the approach stated in Hamzy, making it appear inevitable that its appeal would not succeed.

Answer: In the case of Chen v University of New South Wales (No. 2) [2009] NSWADT 99, the Tribunal determined that the unsigned document, despite having no apparent relationship with any protected disclosure, could be related to a protected disclosure. This was because it was submitted to the Brennan Inquiry, which directly concerned the protected disclosures that had been made. The document was likely to have some significance for the disclosures, even if it only provided a contextual background. Therefore, the Tribunal concluded that the document falls within clause 20(1)(d), which requires that matter in the document be related to a protected disclosure.

Answer: In the case of Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs v CBW20 [2021] FCAFC 63, the Minister commenced the proceeding by filing an application in the Federal Circuit Court, which was later transferred to the Federal Court of Australia. The Minister sought a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal dated 8 April 2020 and a writ of mandamus requiring the Tribunal to determine CBW20’s application for review according to law. The grounds for this were that the Tribunal had exceeded its powers under Part 7 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and made a jurisdictional error in concluding that CBW20’s application for a protection visa was valid. Specifically, the Minister argued that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by finding that the protection visa application remained valid unless and until the determination purportedly made by the Minister under section 46A(2) of the Act to permit CBW20 to make an application for a protection visa is revoked by the Minister or set aside by a court exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth.

Original sentence: Question: What are the new requirements introduced by section 298 and 299 in the New South Wales legal decision R v Bonanno; ex parte Protected Confider [2020] NSWCCA 156?
Answer: In the legal decision R v Bonanno; ex parte Protected Confider [2020] NSWCCA 156, new section 298 clarifies that a protected confidence can be produced or adduced in evidence in criminal proceedings only if the court gives leave. It introduces a requirement to obtain leave from the court before seeking to compel a person to produce a document recording a protected confidence in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings. Leave of the court must also be obtained before a document recording a protected confidence can be produced in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings. New section 299 replaces the old section 303 and states that the court must satisfy itself that a witness, party or protected confider, which includes the victim or other person who made the protected confidence, who may have grounds for an application for leave, objection to the production of a document, or the adducing of evidence, is aware of the effect of the division, and has been given a reasonable opportunity to seek legal advice. The new requirement for the victim to be given a reasonable opportunity to seek legal advice strengthens the earlier protection and, together with government-funded representation for victims in applications under this division, will ensure that the confidentiality of counselling records of sexual assault victims are better protected.

Answer: In the decision of Copyright Agency Limited v University of Adelaide (Interim Orders) [2019] ACopyT 2, the court acknowledged the existence of potential hardships for both parties. However, it was noted that the potential irremediable harm to the Universities was greater in extent than to the members of CAL. The court clarified that the irremediable harm to CAL was not the 50% reduction in its income per se but the delayed payment. The court also rejected the Universities’ submission that CAL could simply cover any shortfall in payments to its members from some long-term accounts.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of debt assignment, what happens if the debt is assigned but the guarantee is not, according to the decision in Misan v Markham Real Estate Partners (KSW) Pty Ltd [2023] NSWCA 51?
Answer: According to the decision in Misan v Markham Real Estate Partners (KSW) Pty Ltd [2023] NSWCA 51, if the debt is assigned but the guarantee is not, the right in the original creditor to recover under the guarantee must at least be suspended so long as the debt is assigned. There cannot be two persons entitled to recover the amount of the same debt, one from the principal debtor, and another from the surety. If the original creditor, the assignor of the principal debt, could show that it was overdue and sued the surety, and the surety paid, then the assignee sues the principal debtor, the assignee must be entitled to succeed unless there are some special circumstances of estoppel in the particular case. The assignee under an absolute assignment could not be deprived of his right to recover from the debtor because the assignor had recovered from the surety. The qualification is that the analogy would be less clear if, in the case of assignment of the debt but purported retention of the benefit of the guarantee, the assignee of the debt had rights of recourse against the original creditor in the event of default by the principal debtor.

Original sentence: Question: In New South Wales, can a building lawfully used or constructed for the purposes of a shop of a particular kind be used for the purposes of a shop of another kind without obtaining development consent?
Answer: According to the decision in Reading Properties Pty Ltd v Auburn Council [2007] NSWLEC 186, a building in New South Wales that is lawfully used, or has been lawfully constructed to be used, for the purposes of a shop of a particular kind may, without the necessity for development consent being obtained, be used for the purposes of a shop of another kind. This is possible upon a sufficient written notice being given to the council. However, this does not authorise the carrying out of any development that is prohibited under the Act, except where the carrying out of the development is so prohibited by reason only of a requirement for the obtaining of development consent before it may be carried out. It also does not authorise the change of an existing use, within the meaning of Division 10 of Part 4 of the Act, to another use.

Answer: According to the decision in Allianz v Fyna [2001] NSWSC 657, it is determined whether parties have entered into contracts and on what terms by viewing the conduct of the parties in light of the surrounding circumstances. This conduct must be capable of proving all the essential elements of an express contract. A contract or its terms may be inferred from the conduct of the parties in certain factual circumstances. However, care must be taken not to infer anterior promises from conduct which represents no more than an adjustment of their relationship in the light of changing circumstances.

Answer: According to the decision in Regina v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, guideline judgments and legislative benchmarks are not inconsistent with the ultimate application of an "instinctive synthesis approach" in sentencing. They are not meant to mandate or remove sentencing discretion, but rather provide a guidepost or benchmark against which the case at hand can be compared. They take their place alongside the prescribed maximum sentence for the relevant offence, and are to be taken into account in the same way that sentencing judges are required to take into account the provisions of relevant sections when exercising their sentencing discretion.

This decision was made both in terms of leave to appeal out of time and for leave to extend the appeal to the merits. The deciding factor was the severity of the prejudice faced by the respondent. Despite the short period of the delay in filing and the reasonable arguments raised by the appellant in explaining the delay, the Appeal Panel considered that the prejudice was such that the public interest in determining the points raised under ss 147 and 150 of the Duties Act 1997 was insufficient to grant the appellant the leaves requested.

Original sentence: Question: What does the term "belief" require in the context of a potential cause of action according to the decision in Pacific Equity Partners Pty Ltd v Kerwick [2017] NSWSC 1302?
Answer: In the decision of Pacific Equity Partners Pty Ltd v Kerwick [2017] NSWSC 1302, it was stated that "belief" in the context of a potential cause of action requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture. It is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting a proposition. Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility. The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question. If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action. The use of the word “may” indicates the court does not have to reach “a firm view that there is a right to relief”.

Answer: In the case of Commissioner Of Taxation Of The Commonwealth Of Australia v Kambrook Distributing Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 30, the Tribunal determined the 'essential character' of goods by reference to objective criteria. It found that each of the three products was one item, with the cord and plug being an integral part of the device. The Tribunal also considered the ability of each product to provide four outlets from one socket, and any additional features. The Tribunal's enquiry included whether the device is primarily to adapt one outlet to two or more or whether it is primarily used for another purpose with the 'adaptor' function. The Tribunal did use the words "primary function", but not in a way that showed that it failed to look at the "basic nature" of the goods. The Tribunal quoted a passage from Diethelm which made clear that it had to determine the essential character of the goods by reference to objective criteria.

The Tribunal found that the respondent demonstrated little or no insight into his conduct. He prevaricated when asked whether he accepted the findings of the Tribunal, acknowledged unprofessional conduct only because he was advised to do so, and did not realise that his conduct could bring him before a tribunal and that he could be subjected to disciplinary sanctions. Furthermore, he did not refer to any risk to his patients which may have resulted from his conduct.

Answer: No, in the case of Qiang v Cohen [2019] NSWCATAP 146, the Appeal Panel did not find an error of law due to an absence of procedural fairness in the Member’s conduct of the Tribunal hearing. The Panel was satisfied that this was not the case at the Tribunal’s hearing on 19 February 2019. The parties accepted that the Landlord was represented at the hearing by her agent, that the agent was given an opportunity to present the Landlord’s case, and that the agent was permitted to make submissions in response to the Tenant’s rent reduction claim. The fact that the Landlord was dissatisfied with the agent’s performance and subsequently terminated their agency agreement did not found any basis for a ground of appeal of the Tribunal’s decision.

Answer: In the case of Tun Min Zan v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 473, the applicant's second ground for review concerned certain adverse findings made about his credibility with respect to his involvement in demonstrations in late 1996. The applicant's representative, Mr Lindsay, contended that these adverse findings were wrong and were based on "non existent facts". However, the court found that the Refugee Review Tribunal's (RRT) findings were open to it on the evidence before it, including other independent information on the 1996 demonstrations. The court considered this second ground as essentially an invitation to engage in an impermissible merit review of the RRT’s reasons for decision.

Answer: In Huang v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 901, the Tribunal approached the issue of "substantial compliance" with visa conditions by identifying and dealing with the requirement in criterion 560.213. The Tribunal set out relevant passages from Baidakova dealing with the proper approach to determining "substantial compliance" with visa conditions such as condition 8202. The Tribunal arrived at its conclusion not just by reference to the 80% attendance requirement, but by balancing a number of factors relevant to the applicant’s attendance. The Tribunal did not make any finding as to the actual level of the applicant’s attendance at Martin College during the February/June 1999 period, but noted her acknowledgment that she was aware of the condition on her visa to meet her course requirements and that she had been counselled twice about her poor attendances. The Tribunal also recorded information it obtained during the hearing about her poor attendances at Martin College. The Tribunal then focused on condition 8202, in the context of criterion 560.213.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of the Probate and Administration Act 1898 (NSW), what is the order of application of assets in an estate and how does it affect the payment of estate expenses and costs of proceedings?
Answer: Under s 46C and Part 2 of the third schedule of the Probate and Administration Act 1898 (NSW), the order of application of assets means that the expenses of the estate, including costs of the present proceedings, would come out of the residue before assets specifically disposed of by will. However, in the case of Bruce v Cobcroft (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 1897, the court decided that to permit this to happen would not reflect the real interests involved in the litigation. The court ruled that the costs of certain tranches of the litigation should be paid out of the estate but should be borne by the testator’s land holdings. For other tranches where there was no element of adversarial proceedings between the factions, those costs should come out of the residue.

Original sentence: Question: What is the definition of "discrimination" as per Section 3(1) of the HREOC Act in the Commonwealth jurisdiction?
Answer: According to the Bennett v President, Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2003] FCA 1433 decision, Section 3(1) of the HREOC Act defines "discrimination" as any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of political opinion that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation. It also includes any other distinction, exclusion or preference that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation and has been declared by the regulations to constitute discrimination for the purposes of this Act. However, it does not include any distinction, exclusion or preference in respect of a particular job based on the inherent requirements of the job. Regulation 4 of the regulations made under the Act extended this definition to encompass discrimination on the ground of "trade union activity".

The Tribunal also did not accept the contention that the respondent's conduct constituted professional misconduct in the Allinson sense. However, the Tribunal agreed with the applicant's contentions that the respondent should be reprimanded and that a fine should be imposed.

(2) That Teakdale has a financial interest in the hotel license within the meaning of s 19(5) of the Gaming Machines Act 2001 (NSW) with the consequence that any application by Dogrow for transfer of the GMEs requires Teakdale's approval.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of Australian Commonwealth jurisdiction, what might be the implications of a tribunal's fact-finding process being unreasoned or lacking rational foundation?
Answer: According to the decision in NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328, if a tribunal's fact-finding process is conducted in a manner that is substantially unreasoned or lacks a rational or reasoned foundation, it may lead to a conclusion that the tribunal reached its conclusions with a mind not open to persuasion and was unable or unwilling to evaluate all the material fairly. This could be seen as a jurisdictional error. For instance, if the tribunal rejects documents as vague when they are not, or fails to deal with answers that reveal a detailed knowledge of a subject, it might be concluded that the tribunal lacked an appreciation of the need to weigh all the material or lacked the ability or willingness to deal with the material before it with an open mind. These possibilities could lead to an apprehension of possible bias.

Original sentence: Question: What was the reason for the order made in the case of Perpetual Trustee Company Limited v Stojcevski (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 110 in New South Wales?
Answer: In the case of Perpetual Trustee Company Limited v Stojcevski (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 110, the order was made because the proceedings were considered unmeritorious and would otherwise require a cost assessment which could involve first instance determinations and an appeal. This process could take between four and 12 months and cost as much as $20,000. Furthermore, the settlement that the cross-claimant reached with the plaintiff, Perpetual Trustee Company Limited, on the eve of the trial means that there may be a surplus of available funds from the sale of the property the subject of proceedings. However, if costs are not assessed before the sale of that property, there is a real prospect that any surplus funds available from the sale of the property could be dissipated unless Mr Mathey has a monetary costs judgment which he can seek to enforce.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of an appeal in New South Wales, what is the general practice regarding the admission of new or fresh evidence?
Answer: In the context of an appeal in New South Wales, the general practice is that sentence appeals are usually determined based on the material that was before the sentencing court. This was observed by Hamill J in Barnes v R [2022] NSWCCA 140. It is only after an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion has been demonstrated that evidence of an offender’s progress towards rehabilitation may be admitted. However, this rule is not absolute. The categorisation of evidence as “fresh” or “new” and the circumstances in which such evidence will be admitted on appeal were discussed in detail by Hamill J in Barnes. In the case of Eden v R [2023] NSWCCA 31, it was accepted that the evidence was “new” rather than “fresh”. That is, the evidence relates to facts in existence at the time of sentence and could, with reasonable diligence, have been discovered at that time.

Answer: In the case of A & D Douglas Pty Ltd v Lawyers Private Mortgages Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 574, the respondent argued that the losses incurred in individual transactions over a certain period were within acceptable parameters for the industry.

Original sentence: Question: In the case of Spence v Waverley Council [2021] NSWLEC 1214, what was the court's view on the impact of the proposed development on traffic and parking?
Answer: In Spence v Waverley Council [2021] NSWLEC 1214, the court found that the proposed development, which would result in the loss of one on-street car parking space and its replacement with one off-street car parking space, was not of such significance that it should result in the refusal of the development application. The court did not accept that the replacement of the one on-street parking space with an off-street parking space was materially inconsistent with Waverley’s People, Movement and Places transport plan. The court also found that any disincentive the proposed development might present to people walking or catching public transport would be negligible. The proposed driveway was found to meet the requirements of AS/NZS 2890.1:2004 Off Street Car parking both in relation to ground clearance and vehicle swept paths, and the construction of the driveway and crossover was expected to improve the manoeuvring conditions for the kerbside parallel parking spaces on each side of the driveway. The court concluded that none of the traffic related impacts raised by the Council warranted the refusal of the development application.

Answer: Under the Commonwealth Civil Aviation Regulations 1998, the Airworthiness Directive AD/PC-12/25 was issued due to the intermittent tripping of the windshield heater circuit during prolonged operation of the windshield heating system in the LIGHT mode on aircraft with the enlarged heated area windshield. The power supply circuit breakers of the LH and RH windshield ice and rain protection system were prone to trip and de-energise the system during flight in very cold outside air temperature conditions, if LIGHT position was selected. This could lead to icing of the windscreen as the tripping of the circuit breaker renders the complete windshield heating powerless.

Answer: In R v Al Batat & Ors (No 3) [2020] NSWSC 1061, the Prosecutor argued that a person's possession of firearms on 14 February is capable of rationally affecting the question of whether they were in a position to supply firearms on 1 February. The Prosecutor further stated that possession of guns on 14 February makes it more likely that a person was in a position to supply guns on 1 February, and therefore makes it more likely in fact they did supply guns on 1 February.

Original sentence: Question: In the case of MKD Architects Pty Ltd v Randwick City Council [2022] NSWLEC 1112, what was the disagreement between the traffic experts and what was the outcome?
Answer: In the case of MKD Architects Pty Ltd v Randwick City Council [2022] NSWLEC 1112, the traffic experts initially disagreed on the vehicle access arrangements for the proposal. The main point of contention was whether there was a need for an on-site waiting bay near the driveway’s connection point with Baden Street. Mr McLaren believed it was necessary, while Mr Nettle did not. The disagreement was resolved when the Applicant’s amending plans, which included the provision of the vehicle waiting bay, were agreed to by the Council. As a result, the driveway would widen along the line of its intersection with Baden Street, leading to the loss of a single parking space on Baden Street, currently marked as a mobility parking space. However, the Council did not raise a concern with this implication as the proposal would provide for a considerable parking credit compared to the status quo and Condition 14(c) would provide for the replacement of the existing mobility parking space with another.

Answer: In the case of Scapin v The University of Notre Dame Australia [2018] FCA 906, the respondents argued that the allegations in the statement of claim, specifically paragraphs [20]-[27], were said to constitute "adverse action" under items 1(b) and 1(c) of s 342(1) of the FW Act. They contended that the conduct of the University of Notre Dame Australia (UNDA) was found in paragraphs [20], [21] and [24] of the statement of claim, while paragraphs [22] and [23] involved conduct by Ms Scapin or her representatives. They further argued that paragraph [25] was an irrelevant allegation of fact not involving any conduct by UNDA and paragraph [26] involved asserted legal conclusions not involving any conduct by UNDA. The respondents also argued that the correspondence at “ETM-13” and “ETM-14” did not constitute adverse action, leaving “ETM-15”, which was an explanation as to the purpose of a meeting the employer wanted to have with an employee. They contended that it was not arguable that the sending of this email, of itself, injured Ms Scapin in her employment or prejudicially altered her position.

Answer: In the case BWC15 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2017] FCA 199, the Tribunal found that there was a very small risk of the appellant being caught in a bomb blast in Shi'a areas of Beirut, given the small number of bombings and casualties relative to the population. The Tribunal also found that the appellant would not be targeted for kidnapping simply because of his Shi'a faith or his support for those fighting IS, as there was no country information to suggest that Shi'a Lebanese civilians were targeted for kidnapping or that supporting those fighting IS would make him a target.

Original sentence: Question: What is the duty of the Tribunal sitting in the Consumer and Commercial Division in New South Wales regarding giving reasons for its decisions?
Answer: In New South Wales, the Tribunal sitting in the Consumer and Commercial Division has a duty under the common law to give reasons for its decisions, as explained in Collins v Urban [2014] NSWCATAP 17. However, the obligation to give reasons does not require lengthy or elaborate reasons, but it is necessary that the essential ground or grounds upon which the decision rests should be articulated. This is further supported by the requirement in s 36(4) of the Act that the practice and procedure of the Tribunal, which includes the giving of reasons for decisions, is to be implemented in such a way that the cost to the Tribunal is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the subject-matter of the proceedings. This was stated in the decision of Patrizi t/as Patrizi Motor Repairs v Garstang [2016] NSWCATAP 114.

Answer: In the case of Nixon -V- Wyong S.C. [1999] NSWLEC 46, the Assessor considered several issues including: breach of building application, lack of planning permission for dual-occupancy development, flood liability of land, and non-compliance with dual-occupancy criteria. The Assessor also considered the submissions made by both parties and the entitlement of the applicant to rely on the benefit of existing use rights. After considering all the evidence and submissions, the Assessor decided to confirm the order under s 124 of the LG Act. The Assessor held that a requirement to return to the use as a single dwelling house as a consequence of the operation of the condition of building approval given in 1974 was an appropriate subject for an order under s 124 of the Act. The Assessor did not consider existing use rights, if any, to be a relevant matter or at least to have sufficient weight to convince him otherwise.

This is because it would allow double payment: payment by the Member under the Grove Agreement and payment out of the scheme property under clause 8.1 of the Constitution.

Original sentence: Question: Under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 in New South Wales, when can the Court order a party to answer specified interrogatories?
Answer: Under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 Pt 22.1(1) in New South Wales, the Court has discretion to order any party to answer specified interrogatories at any stage of the proceedings. However, such an order is not to be made unless the Court is satisfied that the order is necessary at the time it is made (r 22.1(4)). To meet this test, it must be shown that the order is reasonably necessary for disposing fairly of the case or matter, taking into account the interests of both parties. Necessity is not demonstrated simply because the interrogatory relates to an issue between the parties or because a similar question would be permissible in cross-examination. A principal purpose for which interrogatories may be administered is to obtain an admission, which is to be tendered in evidence against the party answering it. Thus, it is imperative that it be expressed with such precision as to produce a clear admission or an answer which is not misleading or confusing. This was stated in the decision of Terry Clout v Alan Jones & Anor [2011] NSWSC 1430.

He was not invited to consider whether the conclusions Dr McDonald drew from the three unpublished papers were reasonable or whether the contents of those papers might cause him to reconsider his view that Profiler Plus had been properly validated.

Answer: In the case of EKS20 v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs [2022] FCA 1363, it was clarified that when deciding whether to revoke the mandatory cancellation of a person's visa under s 501CA(4)(b)(ii) of the Act, the Minister is required to read, identify, understand and evaluate any representations made in response to an invitation issued under s 501CA(3)(b) which raise a potential breach of Australia’s international non-refoulement obligations. However, Australia’s international non-refoulement obligations unenacted in Australia were not a mandatory relevant consideration. Furthermore, to the extent that Australia’s international non-refoulement obligations are given effect in the Act, it is open to the Minister to defer assessment of whether a person is owed those obligations on the basis it is open to that person to apply for a protection visa.

Answer: Yes, in The Commissioner of Taxation v. Cripps & Jones Holdings Pty Ltd [1987] FCA 666, it was established that the court can set aside assessments under section 99A if the Commissioner's opinion was vitiated by error. This was based on the precedent set in Duggan and Ryal v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1972) where the court set aside assessments under section 99A on the ground that the Commissioner's opinion was vitiated by error. The court held that the position was "as if he [had] failed to reach any opinion". There was no suggestion that sections 175 and 177, or either of them, prevented the court from setting aside the assessments.

Answer: In the case of Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Garden Makers (Qld) Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 613, it was found that if each of the four contracts entered into by Garden Makers (Qld) Pty Ltd proceeds to settlement, sale proceeds of $470,000 would be generated. There was a debt due to a Mr Benson of $120,000 which was secured by consent caveats granted by the defendant over the blocks of land and a debt due to the National Australia Bank of $218,000. The present debt due to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation was approximately $120,000 which would result in a balance surplus proceeds of $12,000, assuming finance is obtained and those contracts settle so as to realise the value of the sale price in each case. Additionally, a recent GST audit resulted in a further amount of additional tax payable of $55,427.79, due as debt to the Commonwealth on 21 May 2008. However, the defendant proposed to lodge an objection to the GST assessment, contending that there would be no additional taxation liability and moreover there would be a refund of $60,000.

Original sentence: Question: What observations were made by Mr Hewett, a Council officer, regarding the condition of the trees on the site in the case of Newcastle City Council v Pepperwood Ridge Pty Limited [2004] NSWLEC 218?
Answer: In the case of Newcastle City Council v Pepperwood Ridge Pty Limited [2004] NSWLEC 218, Mr Hewett, a Council officer, observed a total of 191 trees on the site that had been extensively cleared of ground cover. He noted that 104 trees at the southern end of the site had sustained recent injury, consistent with impact by heavy earthmoving equipment. Additionally, 27 trees were standing on the steep banks of a gully, with significantly disturbed soil and building refuse around them. This increased soil level left the trees prone to insect predation and drought stress. Most of these trees had recently mechanically inflicted trunk wounds, reducing their capacity to adapt to the significant change in site conditions brought about by the recent clearing and filling activities. Mr Hewett opined that these trees were in declining health and that the introduction of pasture grasses and associated fertiliser would further weaken them, likely leading to their premature death.

Answer: In the Pritchard v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 44 decision, a veteran is considered to be totally and permanently incapacitated due to war-caused injury or disease if the veteran's incapacity is of such a nature as to render the veteran incapable of undertaking remunerative work for periods aggregating more than 8 hours per week. Furthermore, the veteran must be prevented from continuing to undertake remunerative work that they were undertaking and must be suffering a loss of salary or wages, or of earnings on their own account, that they would not be suffering if they were free of that incapacity. However, a veteran who is incapacitated from war-caused injury or disease shall not be taken to be suffering a loss of salary or wages, or of earnings on his or her own account, by reason of that incapacity if the veteran has ceased to engage in remunerative work for reasons other than his or her incapacity from that war-caused injury or disease, or both; or the veteran is incapacitated, or prevented, from engaging in remunerative work for some other reason.

Original sentence: Question: In the case of Leviston v PQ Management Pty Ltd (No 3) [2023] FCA 986, what was the basis for Mr Ashby's conclusion regarding the capitalisation multiple?
Answer: In the case of Leviston v PQ Management Pty Ltd (No 3) [2023] FCA 986, Mr Ashby derived the capitalisation multiple of 3.00 by considering factors such as TWA's size, access to capital markets, diversification and management capability, relative to comparable businesses. His conclusion that the multiple should be at the lower end of the range was also supported by his analysis of the earnings multiples implied by PQ Management’s acquisition of 70% of TWA’s equity, effective 1 August 2017. Despite being thoroughly cross-examined, Mr Ashby remained unshaken in his opinion and his explanations for his conclusions were found to be well-founded.

Answer: In the case of Burge v Wollondilly Shire Council [2019] NSWLEC 1499, Mr. Andrew Imrie opposed the development application for two main reasons.

Secondly, he claimed that the activities undertaken by the Applicant on the Subject Site had given rise to a range of impacts, including amenity impacts on his family and traffic impacts arising from the movement of trucks to and from the Subject Site along Prices Road, and the use of narrow approaches to Prices Road along adjoining roads and their bridges.

Answer: In the case of Singh v R [2013] NSWCCA 186, the Court of Criminal Appeal Supreme Court of New South Wales decided to grant leave to appeal, uphold the appeal against conviction on each count, quash each conviction, and remit each count to the District Court to be dealt with according to law. The appellant was mistakenly convicted and sentenced for an offence pursuant to s 111(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 contrary to a plea agreement made between the appellant and the Crown. The appellant should have been convicted and sentenced under s 111(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The plea to the s 111(3) charge was not a true acknowledgement of the appellant's guilt, so the conviction was set aside. The convictions on the remaining counts were also set aside as being tainted by error. The matter was remitted to the District Court to be dealt with according to law.

Answer: In the case of Margarula v Northern Territory of Australia [2016] FCA 1018, it was noted that the Commonwealth acquired an estate in fee simple over the whole of the land that was to become Kakadu National Park as a means of attaining an estate in fee simple over a small part of it, the Jabiru land. This was despite the fact that the Commonwealth had no need to acquire exclusive possessory rights over most of the land, but it did have a need to do so in respect of some parts, particularly the future township land.

Answer: In SZHVX v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] FCA 1272, the Federal Magistrates Court addressed each of the grounds advanced by the applicant. Regarding the claim that the Tribunal failed to properly apply the "real chance" test, the Magistrate held that the Tribunal's findings on the matter of credibility were not based on inconsistencies between what the applicant said at the hearing and what had been contained in his protection visa application, or was otherwise on the departmental file. The factors which caused the Tribunal to take an adverse view of the applicant’s credibility were based upon information given to the Tribunal by the applicant for the purposes of the review which it was conducting and, therefore, were excluded by the operation of s 424A(3)(b) of the Act.

Answer: In Antova v Bokan [2017] NSWSC 115, the court found that nothing in the language of Order 8, or the Orders generally, supports the contention that Order 8 demonstrates a lack of intention to be immediately bound. The court also did not find support in the plain language of the Orders for the conclusion that Order 8 is a condition precedent to the Agreement coming into existence. If there were any doubt, the court would prefer a construction that it was a condition precedent to performance rather than to the Agreement itself coming into existence.

The court also noted that the barbecue and entertaining area was largely covered by a roof and that seed pods could fall in a limited area of it – being the area where the barbeque apparatus itself was normally located. The court further observed that Mr Inbari needed to be assisted by his son to walk across Ms Rankin’s lawn because of the grassy surface, a grassy surface not dissimilar to that on Mr and Mrs Inbari’s property and upon which a number of seed pods would fall.

Answer: In the decision of Tenacity Consulting v Warringah Council [2004] NSWLEC 140, the Senior Commissioner defined the concept of view sharing as a situation where a property enjoys existing views and a proposed development would share that view by taking some of it away for its own enjoyment. However, taking all the view away cannot be called view sharing, although it may, in some circumstances, be quite reasonable.

Answer: Yes, an interest in land can be created without writing under the Conveyancing Act in New South Wales.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of child custody cases in New South Wales, how does the court determine whether a parent should be denied access to a child?
Answer: In the decision of DCV v Children’s Guardian [2018] NSWCATAD 21, it was held that a parent will be denied access to a child if there exists “an unacceptable risk that the child would be exposed to sexual abuse if the parent were awarded custody or access”. The court may find that a risk of abuse exists but that the possibility of it materialising can be mitigated by measures such as supervised access, resulting in the risk not being unacceptable and the parent not being denied access. The court is not concerned with “unacceptable risks” but “real and appreciable” risks. In such cases, the onus is upon the plaintiff. The court may be satisfied that an allegation of sexual abuse against an applicant is established, or it may be affirmatively satisfied that the relevant incident did not occur. However, if the court is not satisfied that an allegation of abuse has been made out, but nevertheless concludes that the circumstances surrounding a particular incident or course of conduct means that there is a risk to a child, it may still deny access.

Answer: In the case of R v Shackfield (a pseudonym) [2020] NSWDC 939, the court considered several factors in sentencing for sexual offences against children. These included the abhorrence with which the community regards the sexual molestation of young children, the importance of general deterrence especially when the offender is in a position of trust, and the need for severe punishment to protect young children from sexual attack. The court also took into account the long-term adverse effects of child sexual abuse, which has led to increased penalties for these offences. The court also considered the sentencing practices at the time of the offence, the objective seriousness of the offence, and the maximum penalty prescribed. The age of the victim and the position of trust the offender occupied as an adult uncle were also considered as aggravating factors.

Original sentence: Question: In the context of Australian administrative law, does a failure to explicitly consider all evidence in a decision necessarily result in an incorrect application of the law?
Answer: No, a failure to explicitly consider all evidence in a decision does not necessarily result in an incorrect application of the law. As stated in Khan, Zia Ur-Rehman v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1180, if not all the evidence is considered explicitly, it does not mean that the law is being applied to something less than the material to which it should be applied. The critical matter is that if what is said to be relevant evidence is not referred to in the reasons expressly or impliedly, such an error can be inferred. However, Section 430 does not impose so onerous an obligation in relation to reasons for decision as this submission requires.

The Court concluded that overriding the father's wishes would not have any bearing on the ability of the Agency to find suitable prospective adoptive parents for LJC. Furthermore, the evidence did not suggest that the father's attitudes presented problems in relation to LJC’s welfare such that it would be in the best interests of the child for the father’s wishes to be overridden. There was no suggestion that the father’s attitude towards the adoption process would impede or delay the process in a way that would be contrary to LJC’s best interests.
