You have loaded an AWQ model on CPU and have a CUDA device available, make sure to set your model on a GPU device in order to run your model.
`low_cpu_mem_usage` was None, now default to True since model is quantized.
huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used. Disabling parallelism to avoid deadlocks...
To disable this warning, you can either:
	- Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible
	- Explicitly set the environment variable TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)
