Article: Select one tliird, and never over one half dry, for unless you have a bad stove indeed, you can cook equally as well, and be as comfortably warmed, and save one quarter of the expense. Every man that can, should season his wood under cover, as its value is much increased thereby. True economy is the wealth of the nation — and it should be the pride of all our pursuits, the pillar of our domestic happiness — for it makes the most of our own means for supplying our own wants, and for being useful to others. It is truly the poor man's wealth and capital. Yours, &c. S. P. Remarlts. — We are obliged to Mr Perkins for his communication, and hope he will favor us again. His ingenious suggestions may set many to think- ing. A good farmer in Westboro', tells us he intends to make a fair trial of the plan of soiling cows through the summer season ; that is, keeping them in a yard and feeding them with green fodder. For ourself we have never tried this mode of feeding. The Hon. Josiah Quincy has tried it for many years, and he thinks it a good mode where the land is suitable. The English practice soiling extensively. The manure made from a cow so kept, will be worth twice as much as from one kept in the usual way. It seems that Mr Perkins has made 4 cords and that he thinks he can make six with a little exer- tion. This agrees with a statement in our last pa- per that one cow would make manure enough for an acre of tillage land each season. We have often said a middling cow will make twice as much manure as a middling hog. But the great difficulty with most farmers is, that they have lands so rough or bo distant that they cannot be easily njown and the green crops carted to the yard. Another objection is the increased labor of tending the cowa. But our correspondent suggests that a mechanic who keeps but one, may feed her from half an acre of land, or even one fourth of an acre, if it is made rich. Now if half an acre will be sufficient, it will be the cheapest keeping that a mechanic can have ; for the labor of mowing enough for his cow, each day, would be less than the labor of driving 80 rods to a pasture ; and a mechanic whose business is constantly at his own shop, could cut his grass without the least inconvenience. Nay, he might be absent for a day, and more, for his fodder would keep longer than the manna of the men of Israel, and any of his family could deal it out. We should like to see many more trials of this mode of feeding. We are not yet prepared to re- commend it strenuously to our friends, though we think there are many strong arguments in its fa- vor. It is a fact that in hot weather, in fly lime, cows are much more fond of getting into the barn, or under it, than of remaining out; so are horses, though Ihey are not so annoyed with flies. Racks may be so made as to save nearly all th fodder ; and where a man's land lies close to tli barn and can be mown, it may be the most econc mical mode of keeping his cattle. If six, or evr four cords of manure can be made from a cow, will make a tolerable dressing, even for land ; tillage. But grass lands may be kept in good o! der with one fourth part of what is required fe grain or for potatoes. We invite our hlacksmitl and our shoemakers to make a partial trial of th mode of keeping. In regard to the comparative economy of usin dry and green wood, much may be said. It is bi lieved by many that a green stick of hard wood, you can make it burn, will give out more heat tha the same stick when dried, and we are inclined 1 adopt this opinion. One advantage of dry wood i you may keep a fire with it without putting o half a cord at a time. If you have a stove, wil short pipes, not liable to be choked up, you may t well use green wood as dry, after your fire is we kindled. We are pretty confident there is no loi in it; there may be considerable gain, as our co respondent suggests; and his assertion in regai to charred wood, green and dry, is worth attcndini to. The sap of wood is not pure water. The wai nut and the rock maple have sap that is full of st' gar ; and both these kinds of wood are more vali able for fuel when green than when dry. Bol will burn freely enough in any common fire-plac and these are the best kinds of fuel in the countr Next come the yellow locust and the apple tre The sap of these also is quite rich, and both wi burn well in a green state. — Ed.

With our neighbor of the New England Farmer, in his remarks on this important subject, we con- cur in the sentiment expressed, " that it is matter of rejoicing, that much ia yet to be learned — and may the time never come when man shall be com- pelled to till the earth without having it in his power to learn how to do his work better." Should the editorial corps, by the diffusion of practical truths and the lights of science, be the happy instruments of hastening the world towards a state of perfection in the cultivation of the earth, even until it should groan under the burthen of its productions, and man become surfeited with its riches and luxuries, still would we say, in the spi- rit of the age, go ahead. Man's destiny is not li- mited to " Tliis mouldy vesture of decay," that feeds upon material stuff. He was not made for a mere tiller of the soil, to muddle in the dirt. This ball of earth is but a foctfhold, a stopping place, to refresh his mortal self in his career through time, and purposely made for the benefit and use of intellectual beings, and to be governed by moral and intellectual power. The development and ex- pansion of those powers to their utmost limits, is the grand purpose of his compound existence. And scientific agriculture is the field wisely adapted to the exercise and discipline of his physical and in- tellectual energies, and to capacitate him for that more etherial and exalted sphere of action to which he is destined. But the material results of agri- cultural skill afford no sustenance for the intellec. tual man ; that thrives only on the Tree of Knowl- edge ; a perennial plant, which is the food of an- gels— a plant susceptible of everlasting culture. -Conn. Farmer's Gnz. Duelling — Dr. Franklin. — When Franklin was in England, prior to tho American revolution, ho was one night in ono of the coffee-houses in Lon- don, in company with a number of literary and sci- entific gentlemen, who greatly admired his conver- sational powers, both for their force and originality. A stranger, who was afUjcted with a most offen- sive odor, and who seeined pleased with the Doc- tor's conversation, came into the box in which the party was assembled. Franklin proposed that his friends should remove to another box to escape the horrid smell: they did so, but the stranger followed them : again, at Franklin's instance, lliey removed, and again he followed ; when, the Doctor's patience getting exhausted, he said to the stranger that he would be obliged to him not to follow them again, for his scent was so offensive it could not be borne. He of the smell took this as a gross insult, and challenged the Doctor the next morning to a duel. The Doctor replied thus: "If I accept your chal- lenge, and we fight, and you kill me, I shall in a few days smell as bad as you do now : — If I kill you, you will, if possible, smell worse than you do at present: in neither case can I see how Any be- nefit can result to ourselves or others, and there- fore decline the challenge." — Selected. Ingenious Expedient to Evade the Post Office Law. — The Postmaster General has recently writ- ten a letter, stating that the writing of any thing upon the margin of a newspaper, other than the name of the person to whom it is sent, subjects it to letter postage. Also, that any hieroglyphics come under the same head. " The many ingenious devices to evade the pe- nalty of the law," says the Postmaster General, " may be inferred from the facts in a single case which was brought to my notice. A man had been in the habit of writing on the margin of a pa- per to his father, to save letter postage. When ar- rested by the application of the provisions of tho act of 1825, he adopted atspecies of singular hiero- glyphics. His object was to let his father know that his family were well, and would be up in a few days ; so he sent a newspaper with nothing but his name written on it : but he had penciled on the margin a fac simile of a saddler's awl, point- ing towards the representation of a well with a sweep and bucket going up — thus distinctly con- veying the message to his father that 'all his fam- ily were well, and were coining up to see him.' " There is this difference between health and mo- ney : money is the most envied, but the least enjoy- ed ; health is the most enjoyed but the least envied ; and the superiority of the latter is still more obvi- ous when we reflect that the poorest man would not part with health for money, but that the rich- est would gladly part with all his money for health. Worse than the Toothache. — A Dutchman, pro- ceeding to a place from whence he heard cries of distress, discovered one of his countrymen lying under a stone wall which had fallen upon him and fractured his legs. " Veil, den, neighbor Vander- diken, vat ish de matter vid you .'" " Vat de mat- ter I vy do n't you see mine conditions, vid all deesh pig stones upon me, and poth mini^ legs proke off close py mine poddy.'" '' Mine Cot !" said Honie, "ish dat all ? you hollered so like tun- der, I thought you wash got de toothache !" — Se- lected. Be slow to believe you are wiser than all others : it is a fatal but common error. Where one has been saved by a true estimation of another's weak- ness, thousands have been destroyed by a false ap- preciation of their own strength. Napoleon could calculate the former well, but to his miscalculations of the latter, may be ascribed his roin. — Lacon. 190 NEW ENGLAND FARMER, DEC. It.HS'ia. Ann HORTICULTURAL REGISTER. | Boston, Wednesday, Dkcember 14, 1842. LYING ABOUT CROPS AND PROFITS. 1 " Some books arc lies frae end to end, And some great lies were never penn'd ; Ev'n mmisters. they have been kenn'd In holy rapture, A rousing whid,at times to vend, And nail't wi' scripture." Mr Editor — There seems to me a spirit of lying abroad which ought to be rebuked, and I wish you would give your roaders a homily on the subject, " And nail't vvi' scripture." From my recollection of your ef- forts in that way in " old times," I have reason to know that such an exercise would bo as wholesome to some of your correspondents and to many of your readers, as are your excellent hints on the management of the farm. I refer more particularly to the habit of bragging, so mueh indulged in in the papers and public reports. In your paper of the 7th December, there is an article cre- dited ? to the Worcester Spy, and headed " Apples," which is a good specimen of what I refer to. It con- tains as many lies as lin«s. There is no doubt that the person referred to in the article has the thirty acres of apple trees, and just ns little doubt that he has spent fifty years in rearing them, and that they are nearly the whole result of the labor of a life. The fact, however, that the 15U0 trees on tliese 30 acres, now in a " fine healthy slate and full bearing," produce no more than 800 barrels of apples, shows a want of skill in their se- lection or management, which I should think he would be slow to brag of. There was no occasion for "scour- ing" the country for trees to make additions to his orch- ard. Enough might be found within ten miles of Boston and at reasonable prices loo, for his wants, if they were ten times as great as they are. The assertion that he could have three dollars and a Haifa barrel for his 800 barrels of apples, is too gieat a lie to dwell on. Every one ^who has dealt in the arti- cle this year, knows that selected Baldwins can hardly be sold at retail for two dollars, and that the wholesale price has not been, and is not now, above one dollar and a half a barrel. If" the demand for exportation is limited only by the supply," as the article asserts, why do not the dealers now ship off some of the thousands of barrels that are now rotting in our cellars and cannot be sold here.' It is true that one merchant has shipped about 500 barrels of this article annually for a few years past, to Calcutta but wiih various and not uniform success. He ships them <in his cargoes of ice, and could not of course send them in any other way. He bought his supply this year for $1 50 a barrel. This, after rejecting fully one third as unfit for shipping such a distance, makes the cost of what remain $2 25. Only the very fairest are ever shipped to that market. It i» notoriously untrue that shipments to England, the West Indies, S. America, and the Mediterranean give equally good returns. Shipments to nearly all those places have been almost uniformly disastrous. Unless shipped with ice, every body who knows any thing about the matter, knows tiiat they cannot be sent a 00 days voyage with any chance of success. 1 would not be thought, by any thing I have said, to underrate the cultivation of the Apple. It is undoubted- ly one of the best, if not the very best crop that can be raised between the Kennebec and the Hudson, and whin its cultivation is belter understood, the barren looking hills in many pans of that great region will be covered with the trees. Whilst on the subject of bragging, I meant to have said something of some of the slati'inentB made to our late excellent Siale Commissioner, the cessation of whose useful labor.-i, we all regret. But I have only time now I to hint to the assessors of some of the towns in the eastern part of MiddUsex county, that if they will read his Report f.r 1811, (the 4th), ihey will find one " facul- ty," richly developed whicli they probably -never have 1 taxed : and such disclosures of " incomes" as canno f^iil to be of great benefit to them when they next take an account of the " gudes and gear" of the worthy peo" pie in those parts. Yours, very truly, A MIDDLESEX FARMER. inr Lying, is it .' Perhaps it is. Much is published about farming in general, and nbout the productiveness and profits of particular farms, that no farmer can be- lieve. Whether this is the result of downright ii/m^> or the result of ignorance and llioughtlessnes?, it may not be easy to determine. It is unfortunate that so many false and misleading things in relation to farming, should be circulated. They give false and deluding no- tions to the people of all other pursuits — they tend to make the inhabitants of cities and villages look upon faimers as the most unthankful and grumbling set of men upon the face of the earth — they operate also to al- lure many a mechanic and trader from a business by which he can earn a good living, to a farm where he will almost surely run behind hand. In these times of mercantile embarrassments, and of perplexities in trade, hundreds and thousands are asking whether it would not be well for them to leave the thronged city and sef tie down upon a farm. To such we must say emphati- cally, that there is no probability— that there is scarcely a possibility that a man who has spent many of his days in the city, and got city habits and tastes fixed upon himself and his family— there is scarcely a possibility that he can get a bare living from a 5 or 6000 dollar farm. If he can live where he is, he had better stay where he is, unless he has several thousands to spare after the farm is paid for. To those who are practically unacquainted with farming, we must say, do not believe the many statements which represent farming as very ■profitable. Now and then a particular crop niay give its grower a large profit, but this is an exception to the gen- eral rule. We hardly know where the chief fault lies. Papers devoted to ngricultftre are established, and must be fill- ed from week to week or month to month. The farm- ers themselves, they who know all the facts, are reluc- tant to write them out; but an attempt must be made to get them. Let an editor talk awhile with a farmer and he may get at some of the desirable facts as to his pro- cesses and results — but it is generally only a part of them, and that part such as lead to wrong inferences. In some such way as this, many of the objectionable articles are made up, we presume, though we cannot plead guilty to doing much in this way. A plentiful intermixture of lies and exaggerations, and marvels makes a paper the more palatable to too many readers, and perhaps extends the fame and circula- tion of the paper. This may argue a depraved public laaie ;— but the existence of such depravity will mani- fest itself, whether argued into light or not; and there are loo many writers ready to earn a copper by catering to this depravity. The evil alluded to, and pointed out by our corres- ptindent, does prevail most extensively. We see it and feel it every week. We are obliged, much against our will, to give circulation to many things coming through most respectable exchange papers — that we can't make up our minds to believe, and yet, we can't doubt, with out saying to some rsspectable man — " you lie, air." We are not sorry to see the lies of such an article n: that which our correspondent has criticised, thus expos ed — some of them are apparent to every reader ^ho lia sold a barrel of apples. And if it is thought right tlir we should bear a portion of the blame for admitting ili lies to the columns of the Farmer — we must say Jlmcn Self Culture, by William E. Channing, D. D,w:i a Biographical ijketch of the Author. James Munroe & Co., Boston, have just published ai uncommonly neat little vol., comprising a few fact? i Dr. Channing's life, and also an address by this gifle man, on Self Culture, which he delivered in Bostui September, 1838, as introductory to the Franklin Lti tures. The well known views of this gifted man, in regar to the nature, capabilities and destiny of the human sou and in regard to man's duty to himself, are all that nee be remembered, to show that a work from his polishc and soul stirring pen, would be instructive and useful I every reader. We are glad to dee the address in a fori which will make it not unseemly on the centre table i in the parlor. It will make a pretty and useful Chris mas or New Year's present. Distemper among Cattle in Brairtlree. — We last wet mentioned the death of an ox and two cows in Brai; tree — and a report also that nine hogs, that eat of tl meat of the ox had died. This part of the story, that i the death of the Jwgs, is all fabulous. Stores — It is downright madness, isn't it.' to say word against the general use of stoves. They are convenient — they save so much fuel — they keep t, house so warm. All these benefits are claimed ; ai let them be allowed. But even then it is questional whether Ihey are worth having. The confined and u healthy air, and the great heat, though not unpleasii to many people, while breathing and feeling them, j must have, in very many instances, very debilitating fects. Good, pure air is one of the absolute requisites general good health. Stoves generally, and anthrac coal in small or close rooms, both work a portion of t debility and also of the dejection and low spirits whi are common, and are, we think, on the increase. Consumption. — Mr Adams Mott gives the follow! statement in the Maine Farmer: — "A friend of mil who resides in Industry, in this State, told me his w was sick of what the doctors call consumption. S was visited by five physicians, who gave her over. S was very sick — was unable to set up — had a sevi cough — and grew no better, but rather worse. She collected that she had before received benefit from t use of St. Johnswort : her husband procured some it — it was steeped, and she made it her constant drir For four or five days there appeared to be but little al ration; but afier this, she grew belter very fast; a her health was so much improved, that in the coi six or eight weeks she was able to resume ber custon ry occupations." Man is an embodied paradox, a bundle of contrad lions; and as some set-off against the marvellous thin that he has dono, we might fairly adduce the monstro things that he has Wieserf. The more gross the frat the more glibly will it go down, and the more greedi will it be swallowed — since folly will always find fai wherever impostors will find impudence. — Lacon. ^•01.. XXI.

A Corn sheller is one of the most convenient and labor saving implements that the practical farmer has in use. Various machines for ibis purpose have been invented. It can be used in all cases for large or small sizt'd ears. It is very simple in its construction, and durable in its operation, and no way liable to get of order ; one man can work it to good advantage, though a man to turn, and a boy to feed il, works it much better than one alone. They are so light and portable, as to be easily removed from place to pla~ce, and one machine will serve for several families or even the in- habitants of a small town. Willis's Impboved Double Operating Corn Shel- ler.— The most perfect and substantial article that has been introduced for the purpose ; this machine can be worked by hand, or any other power, and will shell two ears of corn at the same time; they are highly approved by all that have used them.

Hind, wlio always signs his letters " B Hind," and certainly a more appropriate signature was nev- er known. I waited from twelve o'clock, the hour mentioned, until near two, before he came, and 1 gently hinted to Mr B Hind, how much he was behind his time. II My dear sir," said he, "you may tliink it strange, but I had the misfortune to be born half an hour too late, and though I 've been in a bustle ever since, I have never, with all my industry, been able to bring up the'loat time." " Indeed ! how so ?" " Why listen, and I'll conviuoe you that in my appointment with you, I have only been keeping up the part allotted me by fate, even before I was born. My grandfather had two daughters who were both married on the same day. He had made his will, and then read it to them. By it, he bequeath- ed the whole of his property, £20,000, to that daughter who was first blessed with a eon. With such a sum in perspective, who would not wish for a child? And my mother no sooner found that such a result was probable, than my delighted fath- er engaged the doctor and nurse, and baby linen was Tmrnediately prepared ; there was, however, one drawback to his joy — my mother'a sister had similar expectations. " The momentous hour at length arrived, 'big with the fate of £30,000. At eight o'clock in the morning I came into 'this breathing world,' but my fortunate rival at half past seven — and thus 1 was too late, because he was before me. " My parents, disappointed in their expectations of wealth, cared' little about me, and I was suffered to run wild till eleven years of age, when they sent me to school. The young urchins laughed to see a great boy, or booby, as they called me, spelling his a b, ab, and so teazed me during the few months I stayed, that a dunce I remained — a sad proof that I had gone to school too late. " At length my father procured me a berth on board an Indiaman. I was rigged out— my stores sent to the vessel— I parted with my parents with- out regret, for they loved me too late— ■passed two days in London— left in the evening— travelled all ni^ht to Portsmouth, and to my consternation found'the ship had sailed the day before— of course, I was loo late. " My father thought then the best plan to settle me would be by matrimony, and I was introduced to a young lady who possessed both beauty and money, but she had another suitor. However, her father and mine agreed upon the wedding day— the ring was bought, and every thing arranged. To keep the matter private, I was to meet her at the church. Unluckily, I overslept myself by the hla\ half hour — I arrived at the church doors just in time to see my intended bride walking out as the wife of my rival ! I was too late, and remain- ed B Hind solus. "In short, I was born too late, educated too late I can't say I was settled too late, because I have never been settled at all — I can 't keep a lodging, for all my landladies say I come home too late — then I am unfit for business, because 1 get up too late if 1 go to the play I 'm too late — whether I have to 'buy or sell, I'm always too late — and I verily believe, that if I were going to be hanged, I should come to the scaffold half an hour too late. I am called the late Mr B Hind, and, true to the cognomen, I am always behind." — JV. Y. JVews.

Article: The first streak of dawn is the signal for lowering the boats, all pulling for the head- waters, where the whales are expected to be found. As soon as one is seen, the officer who first discovers it sets a “ waif” (a small flag) in his boat, and gives chase. Boats belonging to other vessels do not interfere, but go in search of other whales. When pursuing, great care is taken to keep behind, and a short distance from the animal, until it is driven to the extremity of the lagoon, or into shoal water; then the men in the nearest boats spring to their oars in the exciting race, and the animal, swimming so near the bottom, has its progress impeded, thereby giving its pursuers a decided advantage: although occasionally it will sud- denly change its course, or “dodge,” which frequently prolongs the chase for hours, disposed of.

Should this enter a vital part and explode, it kills instantly, but it is not often this good luck occurs; more frequently two or three bombs are shot, which paralyze the animal to some extent, when the boat is hauled near enough to use the hand-lance. After repeated thrusts, the whale becomes sluggish in its motions; then, going “close to,’ the hand-lance is set into its ‘life,’ which completes the capture. The animal rolls over on its side, with fins extended, and dies without a struggle. Sometimes it will circle around within a small compass, or take a zigzag course, heaving its head and flukes above the water, and will either roll over, ‘‘fin out,’ or die under water and sink to the bottom. Thus far we have spoken principally of the females, as they are femnd.in, the lagoons. Mention has been made, however, of that general habit, common to both male and female, of keeping near the shore in making the passage between their northern and southern feeding-grounds. This fact becoming known, and the bomb- guny coming into use, the mode of capture along the outer coast was changed. The whaling parties first stationed themselves in their boats at the most favorable points, where the thickest beds of kelp were found, and there lay in wait watching for a good chance to shoot the whales as they passed. This was called ‘kelp whaling.” The first year or two that this pursuit was practiced, many of the animals * Whalemen call the forward part of a whale- boat the head, differing from merchantmen, who term it the bow; still, the oar next to the for- ward one in a whale-boat is named the bow- oar. And, likewise, when the boat is hauled close up to the whale by heaving the line out of the ‘“‘bow-chocks,” and taking it to one side against a cleat which is placed a few feet aft of the extreme bow, it is called ‘‘bowing- on.” ¢ The bomb-gun is made of iron, stock and all. It is three feet long, the barrel of which is twenty-three inches in length; diameter of bore, one and one-eighth of an inch; weight, twenty-four pounds. It shoots a bomb-lance twenty-one and a half inches long, and of a size to fit the bore. It is pointed at the end, with sharpened edges, in order to cut its way through the fibrous fat and flesh, and is guided by three elastic feathers, which are attached along the fuse tube, folding around it when in the barrel. The gun is fired from the shoulder, in the same way as a musket. For illustration, see plate xxiii. THE CALIFORNIA GRAY WHALE. 27 passed through or along the edge of the kelp, where the gunners chose their own distance for a shot. This method, however, soon excited the suspicions of these sagacious creatures. At first, the ordinary whale-boat was used, but the keen- eyed ‘‘Devil-fish” soon found what would be the consequence of getting too near the long, dark-looking object, as it lay nearly motionless, only rising and falling with one man to scull and another with the rolling swell. A very small boat to shoot—was then used, instead of the whale-boat. This proved successful for a time, but, after a few successive seasons, the animals passed farther seaward, and at the present time the boats usually anchor outside the kelp. The mottled fish being scen approaching far enough off for the experienced gunner to judge nearly where the animal will ‘break water,” the boat is sculled to that place, to await the ba “rising.” If the whale ‘‘shows a good chance,” it is frequently killed instantly, and sinks to the bottom, or receives its death-wound by the bursting of the bomb- lance. Consequently, the stationary position or slow movement of the animal enables the whaler to get a harpoon into it before sinking. To the harpoon a lne is attached, with a buoy, which indicates the place where the dead creature lies, should it go to the bottom. Then, in the course of twenty-four hours, or in less time, it rises to the surface, and is towed to the shore, the blubber taken off and tried out in pots set for that purpose upon the beach. Another mode of capture is by ships cruising off the land and sending their boats inshore toward the line of kelp; and, as the whales work to the southward, the boats, being provided with extra large sails, the whalemen take advantage of the strong northerly winds, and, running before the breeze, sail near enough to be able to dart the hand-harpoon into the fish. ‘Getting fast” in this way, it is killed in deep water, and, if inclined to sink, it can be held up by the boats till the ship comes up, when a large “fluke-rope” is made fast, or the “fin-chain” is secured to one fin, the ‘‘cutting-tackle” hooked, and the whale “cut in” immedi- ately. This mode is called ‘‘sailing them down.” Still another way of catching them is with ‘“Greener’s Harpoon Gun,” which is similar to a small swivel-gun. It is of one and a half inch bore, three feet long in the barrel, and, when stocked, weighs seventy-five pounds. The harpoon, four feet and a half long, is projected with considerable accuracy to any distance under eighty-four yards. The gun is mounted on the bow of the boat. A variety of manceuvres are practiced when using the weapon: at times the boat lying at anchor, and, again, drifting about for a chance-shot. When the animal is judged to be ten fathoms off, the gun is pointed eighteen inches below the back; if fifteen fathoms, eight or ten inches below; if eighteen or twenty fathoms distant, the gun is sighted at the top of its back. 28 MARINE MAMMALS OF THE NORTH-WESTERN COAST. Still another strategic plan has been practiced with successful results, called ‘whaling along the breakers.” Mention has been already made of the habit which these whales have of playing about the breakers at the mouths of the lagoons. This, the watchful eye of the whaler was quick to see, could be turned to his advantage. After years of pursuit by waylaying them around the beds of kelp, the wary animals learned to shun these fatal regions, making a wide deviation in their course to enjoy their sports among the rollers at the lagoons’ mouths, as they passed them either way. But the civilized whaler anchors his boats as near the roaring surf as safety will permit, and the unwary ‘‘Mussel-digger” that comes in reach of the deadly harpoon, or bomb-lance, is sure to pay the penalty with its life. If it come within darting distance, it is harpooned; and, as the stricken animal makes for the open sea, it is soon in deep water, where the pursuer makes his capture with comparative ease; or if passing within range of the bomb-gun, one of the explosive missiles is planted in its side, which so paralyzes the whale that the fresh boat’s-crew, who have been resting at anchor, taking to their oars, soon overtake and dispatch it. The casualties from coast and kelp whaling are nothing to be compared with the accidents that have been experienced by those engaged in taking the females in the lagoons. Hardly a day passes but there is upsetting or staving of boats, the crews receiving bruises, cuts, and, in many instances, having limbs broken; and repeated accidents have happened in which men have been instantly killed, or received mortal injury. The reasons of the increased dangers are these: the quick and deviating movements of the animal, its unusual sagacity, and the fact of the sandy bottom being continually stirred by the strong currents, making it difficult to see an object at any considerable depth. When a whale is “struck” at sea, there is generally but httle difficulty in keeping clear. When first irritated by the har- poon, it attempts to escape by “running,” or descending to the depths below, taking out more or less line, the direction of which, and the movements of the boat, indicate the animal’s whereabouts. But in a lagoon, the object of pursuit is in narrow passages, where frequently there is a swift tide, and the turbid water pre- vents the whaler from seeing far beneath the boat. Should the chase be made with the current, the fugitive sometimes stops suddenly, and the speed of the boat, together with the influence of the running water, shoots it upon the worried animal when it is dashing its flukes in every direction. The whales that are chased have with them their young cubs, and the mother, in her efforts to avoid the pursuit of herself and offspring, may momentarily lose sight of her little one. Instantly she oe, Wah ee “HONWO L'dIVIS 01 CHHIVILV F3N¥T 9 4SVLS 01 GHHOVTAWY NOOAMWHG AGO H‘NOOAIVH TO MAIN TOGTE TINVI JO MaIA TOCT CMV TOS'2 CIHOVLLV ANTI HLIM.

Another danger is, that in darting the lance at the mother, the young one, in its gambols, will get in the way of the weapon, and receive the wound, instead of the intended victim. Sometimes the calf is fastened to instead of the cow. In such instances the mother may have been an old frequenter of the ground, and been before chased, and perhaps have suffered from a previous attack, so that she is far more difficult to capture, staving the boats and escaping after receiving repeated wounds. One instance occurred in Magdalena Lagoon, in 1857, where, after several boats had been staved, they being near the beach, the men in those remaining afloat managed to pick up their swimming comrades, and, in the meantime, to run the line to the shore, hauling the calf into as shallow water as would float the dam, she keeping near her troubled young one, giving the gunner a good chance for a shot with his bomb-gun from the beach. A similar instance occurred in Scammon’s Lagoon, in 1859. The testimony of many whaling-masters furnishes abundant proof that these whales are possessed of unusual sagacity. Numerous contests with them have proved that, after the loss of their cherished offspring, the enraged animals have given chase to the boats, which only found security by escaping to shoal water or to shore. After evading the civilized whaler and his instruments of destruction, and per- haps while they are suffering from wounds received in their southern haunts, these migratory animals begin their northern journey. The mother, with her young grown to half the size of maturity, but wanting in strength, makes the best of her way along the shores, avoiding the rough sea by passing between or near the rocks and islets that stud the points and capes. But scarcely have the poor creatures quitted their southern homes before they are surprised by the Indians about the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Vancouver and Queen Charlotte’s Islands. Like enemies in ambush, these glide in canoes from island, bluff, or bay, rushing upon their prey with whoop and yell, launching their instruments of torture, and like hounds worry- ing the last life-blood from their vitals. The capture having been effected, trains of canoes tow the prize to shore in triumph. The whalemen among the Indians of the North-west Coast are those who delight in the height of adventure, and who are ambitious of acquiring the greatest reputation among their fellows. Those among them who could boast of killing a whale, formerly had the most exalted mark of 30 MARINE MAMMALS OF THE NORTH-WESTERN COAST. honor conferred upon them by a cut across the nose; but this custom is no longer observed. The Indian whaling-canoe is thirty-five feet in length. Hight men make the crew, each wielding a paddle five and a half feet long. The whaling-gear consists of harpoons, lines, lances, and seal-skin buoys, all of their own workmanship. The cutting material of both lance and spear was formerly the thick part of a mussel- ? shell, or of the ‘“‘abelone ;” the line made from cedar withes, twisted into a three- strand rope. The buoys are fancifully painted, but those belonging to each boat have a distinguishing mark. The lance-pole, or harpoon-staff, made of the heavy wood of the yew-tree, is eighteen feet long, weighing as many pounds, and with the lance attached is truly a formidable weapon. Their whaling-grounds are limited, as the Indians rarely venture seaward far out of sight of the smoke from their cabins by day, or beyond view of their bon- fires at night. The number of canoes engaged in one of these expeditions is from two to five, the crews being taken from among the chosen men of the tribe, who, with silent stroke, can paddle the symmetrical canim close to the rippling water beside the animal; the bowman then, with sure aim, thrusts the harpoon into it, and heaves the line and buoys clear of the canoe. The worried creature may dive deeply, but very little time elapses before the inflated seal-skins are visible again. The instant these are seen, a buoy is elevated on a pole from the nearest canoe, by way of signal; then all dash, with shout and grunt, toward the object of pur- suit. Now the chase attains the highest pitch of excitement, for each boat being provided with implements alike, in order to entitle it to a full share of the prize its crew must lodge their harpoon in the animal, with buoys attached; so that, after the first attack is made, the strife that ensues to be next to throw the spear creates a scene of brawl and agility peculiar to these savage adventurers. At length the victim, becoming weakened by loss of blood, yields to a system of torture characteristic of its eager pursuers, and eventually, spouting its last blood from a lacerated heart, it writhes in convulsions and expires. Then the whole fleet of canoes assists in towing it to the shore, where a division is made, and all the inhabitants of the village greedily feed upon the fat and flesh till their appetites are satisfied. After the feast, what oil may be extracted from the remains is put into skins or bladders, and is an article of traffic with neighboring tribes or the white traders who occasionally visit them. These “whales of passage,” when arrived in the Arctic Ocean and Okhotsk Sea, are seen emerging between the scattered floes, and even forcing themselves through the field of ice, rising midway above the surface, and blowing in the same THE CALIFORNIA GRAY WHALE. 31 attitude in which they are frequently seen in the southern lagoons; at such times the combined sound of their respirations can be heard, in a calm day, for miles across the ice and water. But in those far northern regions, the animals are rarely pursued by the whale-ship’s boats: hence they rest in some degree of security; yet even there, the watchful Esquimaux steal upon them, and to their primitive weapons and rude processes the whale at last succumbs, and supplies food and substance for its captors. The Esquimaux whaling-boat, although to all appearance simple in its con- struction, will be found, after careful investigation, to be admirably adapted to the purpose, as well as for all other uses necessity demands. It is not only used to accomplish the more important undertaking, but in it they hunt the walrus, shoot game, and make their long summer-voyages about the coast, up the deep bays and long rivers, where they traffic with the interior tribes. When prepared for whaling, the boat is cleared of all passengers and useless incumbrances, nothing being allowed but the whaling-gear. Hight picked men make the crew.* Their boats are twenty-five to thirty feet long, and are flat on the bottom, with flaring sides and tapering ends. The framework is of wood, lashed together with the fibres of baleen and thongs of walrus-hide, the latter article being the covering, or plank- ing, to the boat. The implements are one or more harpoons, made of ivory, with a point of slate-stone or iron; a boat-mast, that serves the triple purpose of spreading the sail and furnishing the staff for the harpoon and lance; a large knife, and eight paddles. The knife lashed to the mast constitutes the lance. The boat being in readiness, the chase begins. As soon as the whale is seen and its course ascertained, all get behind it: not a word is spoken, nor will they take notice of a passing ship or boat, when once excited in the chase. All is silent and motionless until the spout is seen, when they instantly paddle toward it. The spouting over, every paddle is raised; again the spout is seen or heard through the fog, and again they spring to their paddles. In this manner the animal is approached near enough to throw the harpoon, when all shout at the top of their voices. This is said to have the effect of checking the animal’s way through the water, thus giving an opportunity to plant the spear in its body, with line and buoys attached. The chase continues in this wise until a number of weapons are firmly fixed, causing the animal much effort to get under water, and still more to remain down; so it soon rises again, and is attacked with renewed vigor. It is the *It is said by Captain Norton, who com- several years ago, that the women engage in the manded the ship Citizen, wrecked in the Arctic chase. bo MARINE MAMMALS OF THE NORTH-WESTERN COAST. oo established custom with these simple natives, that the man who first effectually throws his harpoon, takes command of the whole party: accordingly, as soon as the animal becomes much exhausted, his baidarra is paddled near, and with surprising quickness he cuts a hole in its side sufficiently large to admit the knife and mast to which it is attached; then follows a course of cutting and piercing till death ensues, after which the treasure is towed to the beach in front of their huts, where it is divided, each member of the party receiving two ‘‘slabs of bone,” and a like proportion of the blubber and entrails; the owners of the canoes claiming what remains. The choice pieces for a dainty repast, with them, are the flukes, lips, and fins. The oil is a great article of trade with the interior tribes of ‘‘reindeer-men:” it is sold in skins of fifteen gallons each, a skin of oil being the price of a reindeer. The entrails are made into a kind of souse, by pickling them in a liquid extracted from a root that imparts an acrid taste: this preparation is a savory dish, as well as a preventive of the scurvy. The lean flesh supplies food for their dogs, the whole troop of the village gathering abot the carcass, fighting, feasting, and howl- ing, as only sledge-dogs can. Many of the marked habits of the California Gray are widely different from those of any other species of balena. It makes regular migrations from the hot southern latitudes to beyond the Arctic Circle; and in its passages between the extremes of climate it follows the general trend of an irregular coast so near that it is exposed to attack from the savage tribes inhabiting the sea-shores, who pass much of their time in the canoe, and consider the capture of this singular wanderer a feat worthy of the highest distinction. As it approaches the waters of the torrid zone, it presents an opportunity to the civilized whalemen—at sea, along the shore, and in the lagoons—to practice their different modes of strategy, thus hastening the time of its entire annihilation. This species of whale manifests the greatest affection for its young, and seeks the sheltered estuaries lying under a tropical sun, as if to warm its offspring into activity and promote comfort, until grown to the size Nature demands for its first northern visit. When the parent animals are attacked, they show a power of resistance and tenacity of life that distinguish them from all other Cetaceans. Many an expert whaleman has suffered in his encounters with them, and many a one has paid the penalty with his life. Once captured, however, this whale yields the coveted reward to its enemies, furnishing sustenance for the Hsquimaux whaler, from such parts as are of little value to others. The oil extracted from its fatty covering is exchanged with remote tribes for their fur- clad animals, of which the flesh affords the venders a feast of the choicest food, Plate V. ur Auth Britton + Aer 8, el CAMPO. S TAL, ris CALIFORNIA GRAYS AMONG THE lc a THE CALIFORNIA GRAY WHALE. 33 and the skins form an indispensable article of clothing. The North-west Indians realize the same comparative benefit from the captured animals as do the Hsqui- maux, and look forward to its periodical passage through their circumscribed fishing- grounds as a season of exploits and profit. The civilized whaler seeks the hunted animal farther seaward, as from year to year it learns to shun the fatal shore. None of the species are so constantly and variously pursued as the one we have endeavored to describe; and the large bays and lagoons, where these animals once congregated, brought forth and nurtured their young, are already nearly deserted. The mammoth bones of the California Gray lie bleaching on the shores of those silvery waters, and are scattered along the broken coasts, from Siberia to the Gulf of California; and ere long it may be questioned whether this mammal will not be numbered among the extinct species of the Pacific. MARINE MAMMALS.—5. CYLAPTER: i, THE FINBACK WHALE. BaLEnorrera VELIFERA, Cope. (Plate u, fig. 2.) Another species of the whale tribe is known as the Finback, or Finner, whose geographical distribution is as extended as that of the Sulphurbottom, and which ranks next to it in point of swiftness. One picked up by Captain Poole, of the bark Sarah Warren, of San Francisco, affords us the following memoranda: Length, sixty-five feet; thickness of blubber, seven to nine inches; yield of oil, seventy-five barrels; color of blubber, a clear white. Top of head quite as flat and straight as that of the Humpback. Baleen, the longest, two feet four inches; greatest width, thirteen inches; its color, a light lead, streaked with black, and its surface presents a ridgy appearance crosswise ; length of fringe to bone, two to four inches, and in size this may be compared to a cambric needle. A Balenoptera, which came on shore near the outer heads of the Golden Gate, gave us the opportunity of obtaining the following rough measurements : Ft. In.

(She) triangle, but rounded on the forward edge, curved on the opposite one; the longest side joins the back in some examples, and in others the anterior edge is the longest. The gular folds spread on each side to the pectorals, and extended half the length of the body. The habitual movements of the Finback in several points are peculiar. When it respires, the vaporous breath passes quickly through its spiracles, and when a fresh supply of air is drawn into the breathing system, a sharp and somewhat musical sound may be heard at a considerable distance, which is quite distinguish- able from that of other whales of the same genus. (We have observed the interval between the respirations of a large Vinback to be about seven seconds.) It fre- quently gambols about vessels at sea, in mid-ocean as well as close in with the coast, darting under them, or shooting swiftly through the water on either side; at one moment upon the surface, belching forth its quick, ringing spout, and the next instant submerging itself bencath the waves, as if enjoying a spirited race with the ship dashing along under a press of sail. In beginning the descent, it assumes a variety of positions: sometimes rolling over nearly on its side, at other times rounding, or perhaps heaving, its flukes out, and assuming nearly a perpendicular attitude. Frequently it remains on the surface, making a regular course and several uniform ‘‘blows.” Occasionally they congregate in schools of fifteen to twenty, or less. In this situation we have usually observed them going quickly through the water, several spouting at the same instant. Their uncertain movements, however —often showing themselves twice or thrice, then disappearing—and their swiftness, make them very difficult to capture. The results of several attempts to catch them were as follows: from the ship one was shot with a bomb-gun, which did its work so effectually, that although the boat was in readiness for instant lowering, before it got within darting distance the animal, in its dying contortions, ran foul of the ship, giving her a shock that was very sensibly felt by all on board, and lkewise a momentary heel of about two streaks. We had a good view of the under-side of the whale as it made several successive rolls before disappearing, and our obser- vations agreed with those noted on board the Sarak Warren in relation to color and the creases on throat and breast. The under-side of the fins was white also. At another time the whale died about ten fathoms under water, and after carefully hauling it up in sight, the “iron drawed, and away the dead animal went to the depths beneath.” Frequently we have “lowered” for single ones that were playing about the ship, but by the time the boats were in the water nothing more would be seen of them, or, if seen, they would be a long way off, and then disappear. An instance occurred in Monterey Bay, in 1865, of five being captured under 36 MARINE MAMMALS OF THE NORTH-WESTERN COAST. the following circumstances: A ‘‘pod” of whales was seen in the offing, by the whalemen, from their shore station, who immediately embarked in their boats and gave chase. On coming up to them they were found to be Finbacks. One was harpooned, and, although it received a mortal wound, they all ‘run together” as before. One of the gunners, being an expert, managed to shoot the whole five, and they were all ultimately secured, yielding to the captors a merited prize. We have noticed large numbers of these whales along the coast during the summer months, and they seem to be more together at that particular season; but, as the opportunities for observing their habits have been much greater at that time of the year, we may have been led into error upon this particular point. Their food is of the same nature as that of the other rorquals, and the quantity of codfish which has been found in them is truly enormous. On the northern coast, the Finbacks, in many instances, have a much larger fin than those in warmer lati- tudes, and we are fully satisfied that these are a distinct species, confined to the northern waters. We have had but little opportunity to observe the Finbacks that frequently rove about the Gulf of Georgia and Fuca Strait. Several have been seen, however, in May and June, on the coasts of California and Oregon, and in Fuca Strait in June and July of the year 1864; these observations satisfy us that the dorsal fin of this—the northern species referred to—is strikingly larger than in the more southern Finbacks. Appended are the outlines of one individual of several seen in Queen Charlotte Sound, in February, 1865, which is a fair representation of them all. Those we have noticed about Fuca Strait seem to have the back fin modified in size between the extremely small one found on the coast of Lower California and the one here represented. “DONVT'9 ‘SAVIS OL GAHOVIIV NOOGUVH'S NOOdYVH JO MIA AUIS + ‘NOOdUVH 40 MAIA 3904 °e'AONA' 2° SONWI'L “SLNAWATdAT ONIIVHM.

(Plate vii, fig. 1.) The Humpback is one of the species of rorquals that roam through every ocean, generally preferring to feed and perform its uncouth gambols near extensive coasts, or about the shores of islands, in all latitudes between the equator and the frozen oceans, both north and south. It is irregular in its movements, seldom going a straight course for any considerable distance; at one time moving about in large numbers, scattered over the sea as far as the eye can discern from the mast-head ; at other times singly, seeming as much at home as if it were surrounded by hun- dreds of its kind; performing at will the varied actions of ‘breaching,’ ‘‘rolling,” “finning,”’ “lobtailing,’ or “scooping;” or, on a calm, sunny day, perhaps lying motionless on the molten-looking surface, as though life were extinct. Its shape, compared with the symmetrical forms of the Finback, California Gray, and Sulphurbottom, is decidedly ugly, as it has a short, thick body, and frequently a diminutive “small,” with inordinately large pectorals and flukes. <A protuberance, of variable shape and size in different individuals, placed on the back, about one-fourth the length from the caudal fin, is called the hump. An- other cartilaginous boss projects from a centre fold immediately beneath the anterior point of the under jaw, which, with the flukes, pectorals, and throat of the creature, are oftentimes hung with pendent parasites* (Otion Stimpsoni), and on *We print here Dall’s description of the unusually long and stout.

Sorry for formatting

Sample data, desired results, and an unambiguous explanation would hep.  Do you want a list of unique telephone numbers in both tables?  Do you want telephone numbers that are only in one table?  Do you want telephone numbers that appear only once?

Sorry about that, i was adding example but was struggling with formatting.

Why do you store phone numbers in two different tables?

They are coming from different data sources.

If you want the distinct telephone numbers in both tables, use union:
select telephone_number
from t1
union  -- on purpose to remove duplicates
select telephone_number
from t2;

Global Health (UNU-IIGH), 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Background Many medical staff had not been exposed to T&CM edu-
cation, however most of them had positive perception
about health education/training in T&CM. The provision
of information on T&CM practice and its associated fac-
tors among medical staff may help to integrate T&CM
into the mainstream medicine. Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T&CM) is
garnering increasing interest and acceptance among the
general population. Different types of T&CM treatments
were increasingly applied and practised by the public but
ignorance about T&CM poses a communication gap
between public health and the healthcare profession. The
aim of this study was to determine the practice of T&CM
and factors associated with it among medical staff in five
selected hospitals in Malaysia. Materials and methods This study employed a cross-sectional design, which was
carried out using quantitative and qualitative methods. Published: 29 January 2014 Published: 29 January 2014 * Correspondence: arzu0704@gmail.com

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/S1/O22  Open Access Results A total of 46.3% of the medical staff had ever used T&CM
in their life and 32.5% of them used T&CM in the last one
year, while 48.6% of the medical staff had ever referred
T&CM to their patients or families in their life, and 25.2%
of them referred T&CM in the last one year. Knowledge
regarding T&CM was poor but positive perception regard-
ing education in T&CM was high. Knowledge regarding
T&CM was significantly higher in Hospital Duchess of
Kent (52%, p = 0.001), among non-Malays (44%, p =
0.047), and pharmacists (47.2%, p = 0.03). Positive percep-
tion regarding education in T&CM among medical staff
was higher among females (88.1%, p = 0.002) and pharma-
cists (93.7%, p < 0.001). There was no significant associa-
tion between practice of T&CM and perception of
education in T&CM. doi:10.1186/1471-2458-14-S1-O22

UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE.
FREDERIC P. HUBBARD, OF DURHAM, CONNECTICUT.
LETTER-BOX.
SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 470,803, dated March 15,1892.
Application filed July 21, 1 8 91.
To all whom it may concern.-

Beit known that I, FREDERIC P. HUBBART),

a citizen of the United States, and aresident of Durham, in the county of Middlesex and State of Connecticut, have invented a new and Improved Mail-Box, of which the following is a full, clear, and exact description.
The object of my invention is to provide a mail-box of cheap and simple construction, designed to receive letters and to hold upon the outside papers, magazines, and such mailmatter as cannot be dropped into the box through the slit designed to receive letters, due.
Reference is to be had to the accompanying drawings, which form a part of this specification, and in which similarletters of reference indicate corresponding parts in both figures.
Figure 1 is a front elevation of a mail-box constructed in accordance with my invention. Fig. 2 is a side elevation of the same.
 The body A of the box may be of anysuitable size and shape and may be made of sheet metal or of any other suitable material. The front of the box is closed by a door B, to the inner surface of which a lock L is applied for locking the door. To the outer surface, and preferably near the top of the door, is attached a pair of hooks C C to receive papers, magazines, and other mail-matter which may be too large to be dropped into the box through the slit D at the top. These hooks are hinged, preferably, by means of a sleeve or tube E, so that they may be turned back to the position shown in Fig. 2, out of the way when not in use, and to adapt the box to be packed in small space for shipment. The said hooks are by preference made of a single piece of wire bent so as to form acentral straight portion a, held in the tube E, the two downwardly- Serial No. 400,257. (IT 0 model.)

projecting portions a a, the bottom loops or curves a a and the upwardlyextending hook portions a a F F are small lugs or stops attached to and projecting out beyond the edges of the box and located alittle below the hinge of the hooks to limit the downward or backward movement of the hooks, so that when tipped down they will be held firmly in position for use by the said lugs, as clearly illustrated in Fig. 1.
 Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is v 1. The combination, with a mail-box, of two open hooks adapted to receive and hold mail-matter, hinged to the box and held at the sides thereof, and adapted to be turned back at the sides of described.
2. The door B of a mail-box, provided at its front with hinged hooks held outside of the plane of the sides of the box and adapted to be turned back, substantially as described.
3. The combination, with a mail-box, of suitable hooks hinged at the front thereof and held outside the plane of the sides of the box, and suitable stops F, arranged substantially as and for the purpose set forth.
4. The door B ofa mail-box, provided at its front with a loop or tube E and lugs F, in combination with hooks C, hinged in said loop or tube and held outside of the plane of the sides of the box, substantially as and for the purposes set forth.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. manufactures, markets and sells skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products around the world. Products are marketed under the following brand names: Estee Lauder, Clinique, Aramis, Prescriptives, Origins, M.A.C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, jane, Aveda, Stila, Jo Malone and Bumble and bumble.

NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Net Earnings Per Common Share
Net earnings per common share ("basic EPS") is computed by dividing net earnings, after deducting preferred stock dividends on the Company's $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares (which satisfy certain conditions). Net earnings per common share assuming dilution ("diluted EPS") is computed by reflecting potential dilution from the exercise of stock options.
 A reconciliation between the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations is as follows:
THE ESTEE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include $232.2 million and $169.8 million of short-term time deposits at June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions of $26.8 million and $31.7 million as of June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Currency Translation and Transactions
All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average rates of exchange for the year. Unrealized translation gains or losses are reported as cumulative translation adjustments through other comprehensive income. Such adjustments amounted to $38.0 million and $20.6 million of unrealized translation losses in fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures. Accordingly, the Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading. Premiums on foreign currency options are amortized based on changes in the time-value of the options for the reporting period.
The accompanying consolidated statements of earnings include net exchange gains of $9.2 million and net exchange losses of $4.3 million and $1.8 million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See Note 9.
 Inventory and Promotional Merchandise
Inventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company's customers.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.

Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment was $112.1 million, $90.3 million and $68.5 million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 Goodwill
Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit, currently between 20 and 40 years. Goodwill is reported net of accumulated amortization of $63.7 million and $42.8 million at June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. See the "Recently Issued Accounting Standards" section for a discussion of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") Nos. 141 and 142.
Other Intangible Assets
Other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks. The cost of other intangible assets is amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Other intangible assets are reported net of accumulated amortization of $100.4 million and $90.8 million at June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. See the "Recently Issued Accounting Standards" section for a discussion of SFAS Nos. 141 and 142.
Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of", long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets in question may not be recoverable. An impairment would be recorded in circumstances where undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset are less than the carrying value of that asset.
THE ESTEE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consist of the following:
Of the $2.0 million net derivative instruments loss recorded in OCI at June 30, 2001, $0.7 million, net of tax, relates to forward contracts that the Company estimates will be reclassified to earnings as losses during the next twelve months. The remaining $1.3 million, net of tax, relates to interest rate swaps and options. OCI gains or losses relating to interest rate swaps or options will be charged to earnings over the remaining life of the debt instruments (through February 2005).
Revenue Recognition
Revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped to the customer. The Company reports its sales levels on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns. As a percent of gross sales, returns were 4.9% in fiscal 2001, 4.4% in fiscal 2000 and 5.0% in fiscal 1999.
Advertising and Promotion
Costs associated with advertising are expensed during the year as incurred. Global advertising expenses, which primarily include television, radio and print media, and promotional expenses, such as products used as sales incentives, were $1,255.3 million, $1,195.8 million and $1,100.8 million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
THE ESTEE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Research and Development
Research and development costs, which amounted to $62.2 million, $53.8 million and $48.0 million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, are expensed as incurred.
 Related Party Royalties and Trademarks
Under agreements covering the Company's purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales, royalty payments totaling $16.0 million, $15.5 million and $14.9 million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, have been charged to income. Such payments were made to Mrs. Estee Lauder. During fiscal 1996, the Company purchased a stockholder's rights to receive certain U.S. royalty payments for $88.5 million, which was fully amortized in November 2000. In fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, $6.6 million, $17.7 million and $17.7 million, respectively, were amortized as charges against income.
Stock Compensation
The Company observes the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", by continuing to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", while providing the required pro forma disclosures as if the fair value method had been applied. See Note 14.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and distributor of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. Domestic and international sales are made primarily to department stores, specialty retailers, perfumeries and pharmacies. The Company grants credit to all qualified customers, and does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk.
In each of fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, one department store group accounted for 11% of the Company's net sales. In those same years, another department store group accounted for 10%, 10% and 11%, respectively, of the Company's net sales.
Management Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
 Derivative Financial Instruments
Effective July 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended by SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities". These Statements established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position measured at fair value.
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, as amended, the Company recorded a non-cash charge to earnings of $2.2 million, after tax, to reflect the change in time-value from the dates of the derivative instruments' inception through the date of transition (July 1, 2000). This charge is reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
THE ESTEE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") has reached consensus on Issue No. 00-10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs". This consensus addresses how shipping and handling costs that are billed to a customer in a sales transaction should be recognized. This guidance became effective for the Company's fiscal 2001 fourth quarter. Generally, the Company does not charge for shipping to its customers that are retailers and, accordingly, the adoption of this rule did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial results.
 The EITF has reached consensus on Issue No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives". This consensus addresses when sales incentives and discounts should be recognized, as well as where the related revenues and expenses should be classified in the financial statements. Currently, the cost of merchandise used in the Company's gift-with-purchase and purchase-with-purchase activities, as well as any related revenues, are reported net, as operating expenses, in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. Upon adoption, the Company will classify revenues generated by these promotional activities as sales resulting in an increase of approximately 1.0% to 2.0% in net sales. The cost of promotional merchandise will be reclassified as a cost of sales. Although operating income will remain unchanged, gross margins will decrease by approximately 5.0% to 6.0% of sales, offset by a corresponding decrease in operating expenses. Due to variations in the Company's launch calendar and the timing of promotions, the Company anticipates greater fluctuations in its gross margins and operating expenses on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Issue No. 00-14 will become effective in the Company's fiscal 2002 third quarter and will be applied retroactively for purposes of comparability.
The EITF has reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-25, "Accounting for Consideration from a Vendor to a Retailer in Connection with the Purchase or Promotion of the Vendor's Products". The consensus provides guidance on the income statement classification of consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the retailer's purchase of the vendor's products or to promote sales of the vendor's products. Issue No. 00-25 becomes effective for quarters beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company currently accounts for transactions (e.g., certain promotional allowances to retailers) in accordance with Issue No. 00-25 and, thus, this consensus will not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial results.
 In June 2001, SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" were issued. These Statements establish financial accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Specifically, the standards address how acquired intangible assets should be accounted for both at the time of acquisition and after they have been recognized in the financial statements. The provisions of SFAS No. 141 apply to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001; however, early application is permitted for entities with fiscal years beginning after March 15, 2001. The Company has adopted this standard effective July 1, 2001 and, accordingly, those intangible assets that will continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized. This could result in the exclusion of approximately $21 million in amortization expense for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, intangible assets, including purchased goodwill, will be evaluated periodically for impairment. The Company's initial evaluations are expected to be completed by September 30, 2001.

Accordingly, the results of operations for each of the acquired businesses are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements commencing with its date of original acquisition. Pro forma results of operations, as if each of such businesses had been acquired as of the beginning of the year of acquisition, have not been presented, as the impact on the Company's consolidated financial results would not have been material.
NOTE 5 -- RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER NON-RECURRING EXPENSES
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded one-time charges for restructuring and other non-recurring expenses related to repositioning certain businesses as part of the Company's ongoing efforts to drive long-term growth and increase profitability. The restructuring and other non-recurring expenses focused on four areas: product fixtures for the jane brand; in-store "tommy's shops"; information systems and other assets; and global brand reorganization. The Company has committed to a defined plan of action, which resulted in an aggregate pre-tax charge of $63.0 million, of which $35.9 million is cash related. On an after-tax basis, the aggregate charge was $40.3 million, equal to $.17 per diluted share.
Specifically, the charge included the following:

3. Information systems and other assets. In response to changing technology and the Company's new strategic direction, the charge included a $16.2 million provision for costs associated with the reevaluation of supply chain systems that the Company will no longer utilize and with the elimination of unproductive assets related to the change to standard financial systems.

NOTE 9 -- FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company primarily enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The Company enters into interest rate swaps and options to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company's aggregate liability portfolio. The Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.
 All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (i) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment ("fair value" hedge), (ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability ("cash flow" hedge), (iii) a foreign-currency fair-value or cash-flow hedge ("foreign currency" hedge), (iv) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or (v) "held for trading" ("trading" instruments). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as (and that is designated and qualifies as) a fair-value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as (and that is designated and qualifies as) a cash-flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings). Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are highly effective as (and that are designated and qualify as) foreign-currency hedges are recorded in either current-period earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the hedge transaction is a fair-value hedge (e.g., a hedge of a firm commitment that is to be settled in a foreign currency) or a cash-flow hedge (e.g., a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction). If, however, a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within equity. Furthermore, changes in the fair value of derivative trading instruments are reported in current-period earnings.
 The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, or foreign-currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge purchases, receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with the Company's identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on costs and on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries. Almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency. The Company also enters into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize. The forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options have been designated as cash-flow hedges. As of June 30, 2001, these cash-flow hedges were highly effective, in all material respects.
 As a matter of policy, the Company only enters into contracts with counterparties that have at least an "A" (or equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. The Company does not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is
THE ESTEE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
limited to only the recognized, but not realized, gains attributable to the contracts. Management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the Company's consolidated financial results. The contracts have varying maturities through the end of August 2002. Costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. At June 30, 2001, we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts in the amount of $148.2 million. The foreign currencies included in these contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Japanese yen ($53.9 million), Swiss franc ($28.8 million), Korean won ($18.5 million), Taiwan dollar ($13.7 million), British pound ($13.2 million), Euro ($8.5 million) and Mexican peso ($6.8 million). At June 30, 2000, the Company had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts in the amount of $219.6 million and deferred unrealized gains and losses of $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The foreign currencies included in these contracts (notional value stated in U.S. dollars) are principally the Japanese yen ($80.2 million), Swiss franc ($65.9 million), British pound ($17.1 million), Euro ($9.5 million), Danish krone ($8.0 million) and Mexican peso ($7.1 million).
 Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement. In addition, the Company has purchased interest rate options that offer similar interest rate protection. The interest rate swap and options have been designated as cash-flow hedges and were highly effective as of June 30, 2001. At June 30, 2000, deferred unrealized gains from the interest rate swap and options were $2.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively.
Information regarding the interest rate swap and options is presented in the following table:
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount approximates fair value, primarily because of the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.
Long-term debt: The fair value of the Company's long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities. Included in such amount is the fair value of the Company's commercial paper and interest rate swap and option agreements. Such fair value has been determined based upon estimated termination costs.
Cumulative redeemable preferred stock: The fair value of the cumulative redeemable preferred stock is estimated utilizing a cash flow analysis at a discount rate equal to rates available for debt with terms similar to the preferred stock.
Forward exchange contracts: The fair value of forward exchange contracts is the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as follows:
NOTE 10 -- PENSION, DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Company maintains pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time employees for its U.S. operations and a majority of its international operations. Most plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees' earnings.
Retirement Growth Account Plan (U.S.)
The Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan. The Company's funding policy consists of an annual contribution at a rate that matches pension costs accrued, if any. Such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.
Restoration Plan (U.S.)
The Company also has an unfunded, nonqualified domestic benefit Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
International Pension Plans
The Company maintains International Pension Plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans. The Company's funding policies for these plans are determined by local tax laws and regulations.
Postretirement Benefits
The Company maintains a contributory postretirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees. Retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan. Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree. It is the Company's practice to fund these benefits as incurred. Certain of the Company's international subsidiaries and affiliates have postretirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs. The cost of the Company-sponsored programs is not significant.

Incentive Thrift Plan (U.S.)
The Company's Incentive Thrift Plan ("Thrift Plan") is a contributory defined contribution plan covering substantially all regular full-time U.S. employees who have completed one year of service, as defined by the plan document. The Thrift Plan is subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA. The Company matches a portion of the participant's contributions under a predetermined formula based on the participant's contribution level and years of service. The Company's contributions were approximately $6.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 and $5.8 million and $4.8 million in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 Deferred Compensation
The Company accrues for deferred compensation and interest thereon and for the increase in the value of share units pursuant to agreements with certain key executives and outside directors. The amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $87.3 million and $79.4 million as of June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The expense for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $11.6 million, $12.3 million and $15.3 million, respectively.
NOTE 11 -- POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN TO RETIREES
The Company provides certain postemployment benefits to eligible former or inactive employees and their dependents during the period subsequent to employment but prior to retirement. These benefits include certain disability and health care coverage and severance benefits. Generally, the cost of providing these benefits is accrued and any incremental benefits were not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.
NOTE 12 -- $6.50 CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK, AT REDEMPTION VALUE
As of June 30, 2001, the Company's authorized capital stock included 23.6 million shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, of which 3.6 million shares are outstanding and designated as $6.50 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.

Article: FilePond and jQuery: Add an existing file without uploading it again
I am trying to add an already uploaded file into FilePond field.
This bit of code is working except that it uploads the file again. I just need to add the file information in the data and not uploading it again as it was already uploaded:
$('.my-pond').first().filepond('addFile', 'archive.zip').then(function(file){
      console.log('file added', file);
    });

Someone has any idea about how can I solve this problem?

After stumbling on this (old) post, and doing some digging myself I've found the solution.
When creating the filepond instance, setting the options it is needed to add the load() function to the server object. The load function generates a blob from the remote image when a file is set.
For example:
load: (source, load, error, progress, abort, headers) => {
    var myRequest = new Request(source);
    fetch(myRequest).then((res) => {
        return res.blob();
    }).then(load);
}

Now you can set the default image two ways.
Adding the file by setting it directly in the options when creating the filepond instance. For example:
// File is directly added via options
let pond = FilePond.create(field, {
    files: [
        {
            source: FULL_IMAGE_URL,
            options: {
                type: 'local'
            }
        }
    ],
    server: {
        url: API_URL,
        process: '/fileprocess',
        revert: '/filerevert',

Article: Fan casing



Aug. 4, 1959 R. L. HULL FAN CASING Filed May l5, 1957 INVENTOR Rickard f ATTORNEY mix B A l MMOWMAISWLJ RW United States Patent O FAN CASING Richard L. Hull, Davenport, Iowa, assignor to American Machine and Metals, Inc., New York, N.Y., a corporation of Delaware Y lApplication May 13, |1957, Serial No. 658,601

3 Claims. (Cl. 2310-117) This invention relates to fan casings, and particularly to a split fan casing in which the fan wheel, motor shaft, and motor can be readily removed.
In order -to prevent the deterioration of a fan motor in a fan unit for moving destructive fumes or fluids, the hollow tubular casing of the unit has a walled aperture therethrough, the gas passing through duct means on either side of the aperture, `the `fan blades bein-g loca-ted in the path of the gas stream before or after it splits to go through the ducts on the `sides of the aperture. Inl this type of unit, the motor is mounted in the aperture so that it is segregated from the fluids orfumes traveling through the unit. In such a unit one of the major diiculties encountered is the easy removal and replacement of the fan Wheel and the motor shaft from the unit.
It is an object of this invention to provide means permitting the easy removal of Ithe fan wheel, the motor shaft, and the motor without permitting the fluid flowing through the unit to contact the motor.
 The fan unit provided according to this invention includes a hollow tubular casing with a walled aperture therethrough for receiving `a fan motor therein. One end of the aperture has a slot which communicates with the interior of the casing and extends to the side of the casing. A shaft is connected at one end to the motor and is rotated by the motor. Said shaft extends through the slot and into the interiorof the casing and has a fanwheel connected to its other end which is rotatable with the shaft. A removable wall portion is provided for the casing. The integral shaft, fan blades and motor are removable from the casing by radial movement of the shaft in the slot when the wall portion has been removed.
These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and drawings which are merely exemplary.
In the drawings:

Fig. l is a side elevation of a fan unit embodying the invention;

Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the fan unit with the removable wall portion and the motor unit removed therefrom; and

Fig. 3 is a perspective -view of the removable wall portion.
 As shown in Fig. 1, the fan unit'draws uid in at intake passage 10, through passages 11 and 12, and `out outlet passage 13. The unit is formed so that there is a central aperture, or chamber 14, segregated from passages 11 and 12 in which a motor 15 is adapted to be mounted, in any suitable manner. Wall 16 extending from one side of the unit to the other and around the inside of passages 11 and 12 segregates the interior of the aperture and the motor from the uid flow. In itspreferred form, the unit has an extension 17, cylindrical in shape, which extends upwardly rom the chamber and is wholly within outlet passage 13. A `slot 18 extends outwardly from a central aperture 18a, shown partly in dotted lines in Fig.
a l'assurant Patented Aug. 4, 1959 2, to the outer circtunferen-tial edge of the tube extension 17, then downwardly on one side of extension 17, and then outwardly to an outer top edge of aperture 14. The -drive shaft 19 which connects motor 15 and a fan wheel 20 extends from the chamber 14 into extension 17 and into the outlet passage 13 through opening 18a. It tis clear, of course, that extension 17 may be omitted if desired and the slot formed entirely in the upper surface 32 of aperture 14.
 The casing 21 has a central portion which is generally cylindrical in shape and two end portions which are in the form of truncated cones. The upper cone has a removable wall portion 22 formed with anges 23, 24, 25 and 26 adapted to be attached to anges 27, 28, 29 and 30, respectively, of the casing 21, in any conventional manner. The wall portion 22 also has a flanged arcuate cutout portion 31 which is connected to upper arcuate wall, or surface 32 of wall portion 16. When :the motor shaft and the fan wheel are in operative position, with `the shaft in opening 18a, the remainder `of slot 18 should be closed in order to eliminate the possibility of having uid entering aperture 14 through the slot. As shown in Fig. 3, this is accomplished by a plate 33, which extends inwardly frorn wall portion 22, and is shaped so yas to cover all of slot 18 except for opening 13a.' Opening 18a is formed by an arcuate edge 34 in one end of plate 33 and the arcuate end of slot 18.
Thus, it can be seen that by removing wall portion 22 and releasing motor 15 from its mounting in aperture 14, the motor 15, shaft 19 and fan wheel 20 may be removed as a unit from the fan casing 21. When the wall portion is in position on casing 21, however, the motor is segregated from the uid owing through the fan unit.
 The invention provides a fan unit which is `simple and economical to produce, and in which the parts which require service, i.e., the motor, lthe shaft and the Ifan wheel, can be removed, repaired and replaced. A fan and motor also can be provided (not shown) at both ends of the casing.
It is to be understood that details of construction can be varied without departing from the spirit of .the invention except as defined in the appended claims.
. What is claimed is:

l. In a fan unit having a hollow tubular casing with a walled aperture therethrough for receiving a fan motor therein, a slot in one end of said aperture communicating with the interior of said casing and extending to the side of said casing, a shaft connected at one end to said motor and rotatable thereby, said shaft extending through said slot and into the interior of said casing, a fan Wheel connected to the other end of said shaft and rotatable therewith, and a removable wall portion for said casing having means thereon closing at least a portion of said slot when said wall portion is connected to said casing, said shaft and said fan blades being removable from said casing by radial movement of said shaft in said slot when said wall portion is removed.
 2. In a fan unit having a hollow tubular casing with a walled aperture therethrough for receiving a fan motor therein, a slot in one end of said aperture communicating with the interior of said casing and extending to one side of said casing, a shaft connected at one end to said motor and rotatable thereby, said shaft extending through said slot 'and into the yinterior of said casing, a fan wheel connected to the other end of said shaft and rotatable therewith, and a removable wall portion for said casing having a radially extending plate thereon adapted to close at least a portion of said slot, said shaft and said fan blades being removable from said casing by radial movement of said shaft in said slot when said Wall portion and plate are removed. i

3.

Article: The expenses which were occasioned by these and other preachers at the wedding, caused the good Deacon several persons, the violence of which was, however, regarded dual allynge by his observing that the young woman of the village, being moved there by the presence of an invitation to the wedding party, increased their custom at the conclusion of an unusual ceremony. Indeed, the child profited on the goods purchased by Mrs. Manners and her passengers alone, he found, after a careful reopening, would more than reimburse the cost of oil the new wedding garment of his wife and himself. Colonel Planners found frequent occasion for rejoicing and self-gratulation, on account of the firmness and decision to which he had charged. In his conduct on the Sunday night after the reading of the governor's proclamation. The statutory effect of the proclamation, however, had, indeed, escaped observation; but, at the best, upon the occasion, he considered not withstanding the laws of the state, tenors, tokens of his reluctance; wherefore, at the time, Lucy had been led to her chamber weeping and sobbing by her mother. He had never seen her when she seemed to be fit all on a happy or the spirit-ridden. The child, once or twice, he caught her with a struggle, apparently for revenge, which he was at a loss to introduce. "The child's" Nienrd of mo, poor thing," thought he, with a pong; "I was a. Let's too violent, p'raps." Well, never mind; if she lives, she'll find, I guess, that I don't love her any less than her mother; only for now, I reckon, it's best to keep along pretty much in the future. Effie, if I hadn't been considered, she'd have never been considered in the possession of her husband. I couldn't find it in my heart to forget and neglect her husband, John Dasbrough. During the winter, his wife grew more rapidly than ever in the good graces of his uncle, who could not fail to observe how generously his head-man exerted himself to triumph. "A father's creature," said the Colonel, "is a great man." The night before Thanksgiving, as the pair were standing together for bed; "nestlingen" could not live on the footslob, he'd walk with any two men, on a farm, I ever see; and that's saying good-bye for Andrew was a first-rate of a hand. Next, your, by jingo, I'll give him a chance that'll help him to have a start of his own, long enough before I shall want to spare him. If anything. I did believe he's too hard to suit me, and seriously, sometimes, a little boy's luck, I console him with his kind of feord of me." "I expect," added the Colonel, after a fit of musing, "I expect he feels under obligation to me, for having helped his father in years gone by; and it isn't, to be sure, no bad trait in him; but I don't, actively. I do hate to have anybody from a feeling too grateful. It makes a fellow feel sure of a choky and uncomfortable. And there ain't no need of his thinking he owes me anything for what's past and gone, for by gracious! wasn't John Dashloghroy Before the law, in law, before he was ever this, John's father? and hadn't I a right to help him keep out of joli, on my own account? As the guard Colonel concluded this eloquence, and was "glimmering fixedly at the glowing count in the fireplace where he saw, in fancy, the furniture of the dead Sheriff John. He was suddenly alarmed and amazed by his having his wife come to him in her night-cap and light-gown, throw her arms about. The news learned.

" Can't ye kind o' tell me what's the matter, Betsey I" said ho at last, ivjion the firs't violence of the subbing began to subside. "You are the h-hest husband in tho world," criud the lady, "too — too — g- good fiirmc!" " Well, well ; sposin' I be," rejoined the Colonel, "that ain't nothing to cry for, sartiiily.

"Don't now— don't— dou't — oh ! don't now!" exhorted tho Colonel. "P-p-Tomio me," sobbed his wife, "you won't, will you." "Why of course not," cried the Colonel, with great emphasis, in order to conceal a sympathetic quavering that began to infect his own voice, "taint likely — ahem — after we've lived together much on to twenty one year, that I'm going to begin to abuse you (or the first time." "For one great reason for my doing as I have and shall," continued Mrs. Maimers, "is a thinking of how much happier you'd be for it, if I should die, and leave you, than" "Why! Betsey!" cried the Colonel, sorely wounded by this speech, "what do you mean by I'd be happier if you should die? — Tuffy that's unkind." "So, no," said his wife; "I don't mean that; I mean —, but, I can't tell you what; — tomorrow night I'll tell you — or some time; I — I In sort of added tonight, I do believe," she continued, trying to smile. "Well, well; I shouldn't wonder; — you're so tired," said the Colonel, kindly; "so let's go to bed and get a good night's rest, for tomorrow will be a busy day." "Pretty soon," replied his wife, leaning her head against his shoulder. Actilly," said the Colonel, after a pause, as he caught a glimpse of himself and his wife over her shoulder, in the looking-glass; "anybody to see us would enlighten we were a young couple a sparkling out, instead of old married folks with a thunder just going to be married herself." Presently Mrs. Munnberg kissed her husband, and, jumping off from his knee, found himself getting into bed, where the Colonel soon followed her. They both lay for a long time wide awake, each feeling to be asleep, and each deceived by the other's advice; the husband wondering greatly what could have been the cause of his wife's recent emotion and singular conduct, and feeling a good deal disturbed and uneasy lest it might have been a presentiment of speedy death. "I've heard of such lorewumins," thought he, "but I do hope that this ain't one of 'em." At last, his wife, Raising herself on her elbow, leaned over and kissed him softly two or three times. The Colonel affected to be unconscious of these caresses, and kept his eyes closed; though, after his wife had hung down again, there was less. Three Married. Come each a moment into the firm that he wore off to wipe them out. It was a corner of the street. "I shouldn't want to see her, eh?" he asked. "She should be in the corner," he replied. "She should be in the corner," he replied. But, good man, like honest Pett of old, he knew of the sore eruption that was so soon to be healed. When Lucy saw on the morning of Thanksgiving Day, her heart gave a bound in her bosom, with the shock of a mildness that had been consuming her mind. The day had dawned at last. She dreaded to rise and be alone, the day in which such gifts and moments were to be given. So, as it was just in the morning, she lay still in bed for a while, striving to make that it was utterly false, truly true, that she, herself, remembered but a little while ago, waking in the woman's chamber, and in the very same little white house, thinking how to drive for a drive or in immediate. In plan dir sftiditig it hdidny, that was now going to be a woman, so very much to be a wife. It is a great city, though she has been naughty-minded people in the world. Some of whom, by the way, would be the very first to cry out. It has been, in necessary to preserve certain certain conclusions, which bid me tell what a charming object was our dear Lucy, as she lay that morning in her virgin bed for the last time, while her brain was busy with these and similar thoughts and reminiscences, and her heart filled with an emotion of mingled happiness, fear, and amelioration, was flitting in her white bosom like a frightened bird in a cage. If, with an author's license, I could open the door of Lucy's chamber, and permit you only, my pure-minded friend. AiJi^r, ti> peep in and behold the united minds who was its tenant, and to share her innocence thoughts and services, I should he heartily glad to accord to the privilege; but, I know full well that some prying, prudish old maid or other would be sufficient to mind beholding you on lip-toe, thinking over your shoulder, and then put a pillow on your shoulder. Or, still worse, some corrupt debauchery or wicked make would steal the opportunity to gaze, with ginning eyes upon a place too high. To be punctual by his evil glance. I will not consider such a risk, and you, my gracious reader, will unhesitating o pardon. But there is such a reason why, if anyone would like to know how Joab was employed on the glance. Morning of this day fixed for his wedding, this curiosity should not be permitted. Like Lucy, her especial husband woke early, and. In the midst of summer, with his usual, by, look, lay away before getting up; for, this general proclamation having forbidden the sale of the store, business, and service, the baron, upon this general Sabbath, it was not necessary to open and sweep out the store before breakfast, according to the usual weekday custom. The resolution which, of all others, gave Joab the greatest pleasure, was that, after the dawn of another day, he would be the heir apparent to all the wealth of his rich uncle, the Colonel. "He ain't worth less than a dollar a thousand," thought Joab. "And on that certain, in money and bank stock, and other personal property; two-thirds of which will be mine, my own, just as soon as the end." The estate is settled and distributed; and if the old woman dies, I have the whole. The use of the real estate, except the widow's third, will lie mine, too, by law; and I'd like to see that little part of a lady's house, after the old Coleman's is out of the way, to engage any deeds I speak by her to, if I pass to take measures to get it all into my own hands. I'll pay her for her high estate as soon as Uncle Sturr drops off, and her stuck-up mother, too. By gosh! Enid Joab stood, who hadn't the man to earn enough, even when alone: "by grisb! I'm willing the old fool should live a widow in a spell, and have her thinly, if she wouldn't spend the principal pill, just while I..." Pray her off for the spite she's always had upon me." As John concluded this untimely solitude, he began his mother's voice calling out to him at the foot of the stairs. "Come, my son," cried the old lady, who was in high spirits, "get up and come down, night away. You won't have me to call you tomorrow morning, Johnny." So Joab, thinking first one long, lean, spindling key underneath the coverlet, and then the fellow, gave a yawn and shut the window. "There isn't no need of fixing up any till after breakfast." He had no need of fixing up any till after breakfast. Aapat was a bright, ranshiny morning, and the quiet village street was bustling with the sound of the town clock. There were two or three red-nosed idlers grouped about the door of the tavern, coughed and plying after toiling their morning dining. While their lean cars, too low-spirited for play, were in good condition, exchanging growling salutations under the elm tree in front, bristling their manes and scratching the dried herbage with their hind-paws. Except those no living thing appeared abroad, Joab turned from the window, finished dressing himself, hurried down to the back-stoop, where, after filling an iron skillet with a pint of rainwater from a hoghead at the corner, he laved his face and hands; finishing his morning toilet by the use of one of a pair of penny wooden couches, which he was accustomed to carry in his trousers pocket. Then he went. In with a good appetite to a breakfast, which, as it was Thanksgiving morning, was rather more toothsome than the meals that usually were spread upon the Deacon's frugal table. In the moonlight, John Doshleigh, rising in the morning, had seen to the forenoon and milking of his herd of cows; had, with his own hands, groomed and watered his span of black colts, and had then gone into breakfast at the Colonel's table; for Mrs. Doshleigh, during the hurry of this busy Thanksgiving week, was too useful a person to be spared from the great house; and so John, of late, had taken all his meals there. I wonder that the Colonel did not notice how both John and Lucy blushed when they met curb other that morning. As for Lucy, she was as rosy as the brilliant clouds that streaked the orient sky beyond the hills, over whose tops the sun had just risen. It was lucky for them that the unsuspecting Colonel was not on a state of interloper of the signs of love; for so plainly did John's honest face reveal the secret of his love. In the heart, whenever he looked towards Lucy, that Mrs. Milliners was in a fever of anxiety lest her husband should detect it; and, as soon as breakfast was over, she took her nephew apart and administered a wholesome lesson of reproof and caution. "Get ready and go to meeting, out of the way, this fortification," said she, "and at dinner-time, do for the land's sake, just eat your victuals and look at the pictures on your plate, or anything, but don't keep storing at Lucy so. Your uncle will suspect something, and actually, John, it scares me to see you look so as if you wanted to eat her up. Ah, John, John; I thought you were modest, haughty boy; but, after all, you've got more of your poor father about you than his looks, I'm afraid." And now, it being the eleventh hour of the morning, throughout the length and breadth of the Xiptuck valley, throughout the county of Windham, withal, nay, throughout the whole extent of the State of Connecticut, was heard the merry sound of ringing bells; while, home upward with the wreaths of smoke from every fuming kitchen chimney-top, rose fragrant steams and exhaustless, so that everywhere the frosty air was full of cluming melodies, and the delicious odors of the oven and the spit. The sturdy freemen of the commonwealth, banished from their firesides by their busy housewives, assembled at the meeting-house; while the good damen themselves remained at home, absorbed in culinary cares. Even Mrs. Sweaney's accustomed place in her power was that morning vacant. and indeed, the Deacon, her husband, although he started in good time, did not arrive at the door of the sanctuary until the benediction had been pronounced by Parson Groves, and the younger portion of his impatient and hungry congregation had begun to effect their tumultuous escape. It happened that the Deacon, on his way to meeting, while passing the tavern, had been accosted by the landlord; who, standing at the bar-room door and winking with elaborate slyness, had informed him that one Apollos Swift was in the house, warming himself at the back-parlor fire, and waiting to see Denison Sweeny. "I've been waiting for you, Deacon," said the landlord, "for he's in a dispute fret, and you must come in and see him, of its only for a minute. Tell ye, he's pretty hard up, I guess!" At this intelligence, the withered old muscle in Deacon Sweeny's bosom gave a flutter against his ribs, and his little red eyes emitted a transient, twinkling gleam of satisfaction. Apollo Switt was a spendthrift jockey farmer, residing in the neighboring county town, whose necessities had often compelled him, from time to time, to borrow money from the Beacon; and, in fact, whose present errand in Walbury was to effect still another loan, and to secure its repayment by still another mortgage. Upon his homestead found a fire, oily, Filled to Decon, Sneffordily It's worth. The Decon had, for Some time, been exercising this final application; Included, had put aside a Enlightened jury wherewith to Meet it. "Another fire hundred." Should be. US be counted out of the roll Of bills, and had it stayed in a snug Aghast hole of his desk, "another five hundred and fifty thousand dollars and fifty thousand dollars." Let the interest run up, and then, sometime, when times are tight, just before, and the suit is gone, I'll have a farm in Windham that won't be cost me but a little more than half what I can get for it. So, though the Bell had already begun to toll, the Deacon turned aside, and allowed the landlord into the bar-room. "I shall just have to go," said he to the publican, "and tell the fervent, don't do no business today, though, to manage, after all, 'tis past; and talking over business, when you don't do none, ain't neither servile labor, nor vain recreation." "Oh! Of M-T-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S Back part of the door was again opened, and Don Con Sweny came forth to resume his walk towards the morning house, he had promised Apollo Swift to lend him, upon the morrow, another great hundred dollars, and had fathomed together, equipped and offered to sell, and conveyed to him, by proper and legal guarantees, and as a sacrifice in the law, for the consideration of fifty dollars, to be paid in bond, two months of land; the same being on the building lot, each duly numbered, fronting upon Main Street, in the city of Schenectady, which at that time, as at the present writing, consisted of an extensive ludge of proceedings, pleasantly situated upon the western slope of the Allegheny Mountains, in the ancient commonwealth. of Virginia, district at the Hat, twenty miles from any dwelling of civilized man. Deacon Sweeny and Mr. Swift had been so very busy arranging the terms and candidates of the various such contracts, that the time had slipped by unheeded. Besides, Parson Graves, with the prospect before him of a Thanksgiving dinner, was also present in prayer and sermon as of a Sunday. When, therefore, the Deacon, after a hasty walk, arrived in eight of the meeting-house, and beheld the people thronging from the porch, he was struck with amazement and terror — as well he might have been, indeed, for a reason which the reader will presently discover. His neighbor eyed his disordered looks with wonder; and some, as they met him, turned to gaze; while others, speaking, bade him good morning. But he, on entering, either not at all, or with the briefest form of salutation, pressed forward towards the rear-stone-house door without stopping, until he came to the very step-stone whereon stood Parson Graves. "Parson Graves," said the Deacon, who was almost brusque with disquiet and haste. "Can't you just call a few?" Of the people back, and open the meeting again, for just a while minute!" "For what reason, I pray to know, Deacon Sweeny?" inquired the Person, in great surprise at this engaging request. "Just call them back," cried the Deacon, imploringly — "or else, I will — hello there! — Captain Brown, I say — Left on the James and a lot of you — Here — Come back!" "Doacon Sweeny," said Parsion Graves, "pray cease this incessantly on every. It is too late to recall the congregation, who have been dismissed to their homes." "Oh, there!" cried the Deacon, giving way to despair, while a few of his wondering neighbors, attracted by his shouts, returned and gathered about him, making eager inquiries concerning the cause. Of his distreart. "Oh, dear! Dear! Here I've got in my pocket my son Jab's pulilis, which ought to have been read from the pulpit this morning, and the wedding set for tonight!" "Great!" whispered Captain Brown to Lieutenant Jones; "I guess the Colonel's wife will be on the second when he turns how 'tis." "And the Colonel!" replied the Captain; "went he rare, though, when he hears nothing?" "But, tut, tut, tut!" said Parson Gwyn, with lively sympathy; "what a pity! How came it pass." At hearing himself thus vociferously called, "John, turned back and retraced his steps to the porch of the meeting-house, wondering what could be the cause of such an unusual outcry. "Mr. John Dashleigh," said the Parson, "you will grieve to be informed that, by a most unfortunate omission of a requital and wholesale formality, the wedding of your cousin Lucy and young Joab Sweeny must be postponed." "Oh, no!" whispered the Deacon, with terror-haunted lips. "At least, such, I fear, must be the result of what has happened," resumed the Parson. "Your uncle, having not only learned in the law, but the father of the intended bride, ought to be informed of the untoward event, and confounded with concurring it and its consequences. Will you be so glad, therefore, as to hasten home and communicate the News to him, privately, I should advise; and also to request him, in my name, to come immediately to my house, where Deacon Sweeny and myself will wait to see him. I think, added the Parson, with a quiet smile, "that we had better not go to your house. Deacon, until we have first taken counsel with the Colonel." "Oh, by no means!" cried the Deacon, eagerly. John received the message, and hastened home, where, first having seen his aunt Betsey and told her of what had happened, he sought the Colonel in his bedroom, where he sat reading the newspaper and waiting for dinner, and delivered his errand. The Colonel heard the news with manifest concern. He dropped his paper, and gave a prolonged whistle. "Deacon forgot it, did he?" said he. "Yes," replied John; "so I understood." "How! And won't Axy all but bust when she finds it out! Aetilly, 'tuin't best to tell her; the Deicion, ralj-, wouldn't he safe; she'd take his pelt. I do believe. I tell you, John," continued his uncle, after a thoughtful pause, "you just keep your own counsel, and I'll run right up to the Parson's. 'Tain't so bad as it might be; though, if the women get hold on't, it'll make some trouble, maybe. I'll just take a look at the stuff, and see perfectly what the law is on this point, and then I'll go right along, but, publishment or no publication, them two must be named tonight. I've set my heart on't, as I've told you more than once; and, besides, I've sworn to it, and it's got to be." So saying, The Colonel took down his well- thumbed copy of the Revised Statutes, opened at the index, then turned to the chopter entitled "An Act for the due and orderly celebrating of Marriage," and brought up the force of his intellect to bear upon the question of the construction and true interests of the clause which prescribed that, "no person shall be admitted in marriage, before the publication of the marriage or institution of the parties proceeding therein hath been sufficiently published in some public meeting or congregation, on the Lord's Day, or sometime subsequent, banksgiving, or lecture do not be deemed." In the meantime, Lieutenant Jones, whose Dwelling was the usual door to Deacim Swinton's, had hurried home, and told the important news to his wife; and that worthy lady, leaving the care of the roof to a little black girl, lost no time in going, by the black nurse, to her neighbors; and imparting to Mr. Sweeny and Joah, the aslooniog inlleligence, which so nearly concerned them. It was in consequence of this act of neighborly kindness, that Leonard Jones' household were, that day, forced to dine on chekes pie; the little black pirl having proved unworthy of the trust reposed in her by her too confiding mistress, and the subject of the trust itself, to wit, a fat and tender twelve-pound spring turkey, having been suffered to burn upon the spit, until it was nothing but a crisped and blackened cinder. Though she afterwards attempted, on inquiry, for deseribe the rise of Mrs. Swallow's default and its dinful "feast-t, Mrs. Jones never offered to do her matter full justice." This was her way, freely to confess; albeit she was a woman of different speech, and not a little rain of her gift in that respect, which, although it stirred the deepest terror into the heart of the negligent little black woman. Mill. Endeavored, appaled even the benevolent militia, her husband, was, in comparison, not an ordinary South-easter to a West Indian hurricane, that Mrs. Jones's ready tongue repeatedly failed to accomplish, my feeble pen still attempted to accomplish. When the first furious onset of her indignation had spent itself, and Lad given place to fierce but less violent blasts of wrathful emotion, Mrs. Jones's. Sweely seized her bonnet and stood, and, followed by Joub, entered forthwith, at a rapid pace, for Colonel Manners' house, which, as the supposition, her grieved husband had fled for refuge. The Parson and the Deacon, waiting for the Colonel's coming, saw her through the windows of the poison-house parlor, as she went through the window, and knew then that the doctor had rescued her ears. The Deacon turned and shivered in his shoes, but the wiser Parson took heart and comforted his trembling parishioner. "The worst is over," was he; such violent pillows, however, will fail to carry off, and as it were, only the superfluity of her mental irritation. I think, therefore, that, as my dinner is not yet ready, we had better go up to the Colonel, also; for otherwise it is plain that he shall now see him. So it happened, that when Colonel Manners, after turning down a loaf at the net aforesaid concerning Marriage, returned the Revised Statutes to its place on the shelf, and, putting on the hat, he got as far as the mouth of the mine, on his way to the Parsons, he beheld his sister, the Deacon's wife, bearing down towards him with incredible swiftness, with much following closely in her wake and, in the distance, far descried the Parsons and Deacon Sweeny, bovering at a safe inter-al astern, while, all along the street, the neighbors, standing at their doors, watched from afar the progress of the procession. " Well! there!" eaid the Colonel, in IV despairing tone, ns ho emne to a holt^ mid taking off his hat rubbed his e-calp iu grent ptrph'sily; "mow ef there ain't a goi»' to be « time, I otm I neT«r £««ano!" As tooa. ne Mrs. SwCcny reached (he place where her brother was standing, Dore-hended, she forthwith essayed to spealt ; but the tumult of her emotions, together with tlie eitreinc rt locity of her pnec, liadwell nigh deprived her of all power to u-fe that unruly member of licr body, for the usual vigor of wLicli she wLLi so justly remarkable. She was able only to gaep fortfi a few frngrnents of eiceedhigly abuslTC and cniuiunioos epithets, reference thereby being bad to her hiLsbiuid, Deacon Sweeny. This unwonted unpotcute on the part of UiB lady gave her brother an nuexpectwt mlvatitage, which tie did not fail to im- prove. "I declare," said he, address- ing her with great asnerity, "ye act more lik-e a dnmb fool than ever I knew yo to;" which was, in.iU'ed, the exad 190 TuxVe Marritd, [Angost, tralji ; although, to bo sure, tUo Colonel did not U:fc tlie adjcctivo in its ordiiuuy and literal sense, but chose it to quality the noun, on nccouut of its innocent similarity in ^ound to a more profane word. " Here yo are," he continued, " a racing down here like a nivin' distract- ed crctnr got out o' Bedlam ; and tlio up;ihot on't '11 bo that ye'llstir up Betsey aud Lucy, nml frighten 'cm about the publishment, when, cf ye'd ha' jest kep away, they'd ha' never known on't till arterwards, aud no harm done. And you, too, Joab ; what do you mean by tcoriii' along the street arter this fashion, with all the neighbors a loukin' on, a wonderin' niid mukiu' fun. You ort to kniiw bcltiT. I declare, yo put me out of all cousait with ye !" "Aud Where's the Deacon?" cried Mrs. Sweeny, who, by this time, had recovered breath enough to speak j "where is be; the ridio'lous, forgetful, good-for-nothin', onnateral old ." "Now do you jest come in hei-o!" muttered tbo Colonel through his closed teeth, as bo suddenly griped his sister by the ann, and walked her before him through the gate out of tho street. "Ow-fth — let me alone!" cried Mrs. Sweeny. But the Colonel had grown despondent. He tightened his grip, and gave him a pis-tor a shake or two that set him to the stretch of his shirt. "I tell you," said he, in a low, determined tone, "of you open your head to let out on any of your spiteful shine and yet husband, or anybody else, I'll be damned if I don't give you what he'd ort to get years ago, by grieving! I will, if it costs a string of laws! So shut up your mouth!" he added, shaking his head threateningly, as he let go his hold upon her arm, "and don't let me hear a crooked word out on it!" Mrs. Sweeny was, for once in her life, pretty thoroughly cowed; and, at this moment, greatly to her surprise, her husband and Parson Graves appeared at The gate; but the virago, into whose heart the Colonel's threat had struck a wholesome terror, darted not open her lips to revile the Deacon, especially as he was in the company of the Parson. "Morning, Parson; morning, Deacon," cried the Colonel, trying to assume a manner of smiling indifference. "Come in, Deacon; don't be afraid, your wife and I have heard all about it. There ain't much harm done, I guess." "And what can be done, Colonel," inquired the Parson, coming forward; while the Deacon, shrinking at the sight of the blazing fury which flashed from his wife's eyes, still hung in the rear. "Just come into the house and we'll talk it all over," replied the Colonel, leading the way; but, at the same time, casting backward a glance of warning at his sister. As soon as the whole party were seated in the bedroom, the Colonel went to seek his wife, who was not far off, having, from the window of Lucy's chamber, beheld, with esultation, the victory which her husband had gained over Mrs. Sweeny. He found her upon the stairs, and briefly communicated to her the intelligence of which she had already been informed by John Dashleigh. "Good gracious me!" cried Mrs. Manners, with well-known surprise, "and there's all the invitations to the wedding have been sent, and a good many are coming from out of town. What on earth's to be done?" "Now, Betsey," said the Colonel, taking his wife by the hand, "I'm decidedly persuaded; and I beg on you to be a reasonable woman, as you can be well enough, if you only have a mind to. Don't go to being set and def to all." Argument, as women will be sometimes. You know I have sworn a solemn oath that this wedding has got to take place tonight. I never want to break my oath or to have a fuss about it with you or Lucy." "But to be married without a publication," said Mrs. Manners, in a tone of gentle remonstrance. "Betsey!" cried the Colonel, a little impatiently; "you know you've seen me marry, just and last, a hull bamvard full of couples, that probably had never been published. But come, there's the Parson, Aiy, Joab, and the Deacon, all a woitin' down in the bedroom to hear lay opinion about the matter. I'm going to read them the law, and explain upon it. Just come along, and if you only reasonable, I'll satisfy you all." The Colonel was cridily sadly bothered and annoyed, and his wife, who loved him with all her heart, said nothing more to add to his vexation. "I'm willing, husband," said she, pressing his hand, "that if your heart is set upon it, your only soul will be filled tonight; just it's turn to fall short to have our only mind alive like a prince." Throughout the text, the following corrections have been made to the original text: "I know it, Beply," said I, "but it can't be expected." So Mrs. Manner, without further remark, followed her husband into the bed, where the others were waiting. The Deacon felt greatly relieved, which we, indeed, for him most opportune; for off the present possession of Union Graves, it was not possible to leave the place to which Mrs. H. Peery kept the peace to her husband. As soon as the usual greetings had been exchanged, Mrs. Manner and the Mission, the Colonel took down the Estate-Book again, and opened at the place where the leaf was turned down. "We all know that the usual form of publication of intention has been emitted," said Puntos Grafos, looking at his watch, and thinking of his dinner. Let us leave no time in deciding what to be a bride, with respect to the wedding, which, otherwise, would have been settled to the church. Joseph, you are one of the parties most interested. Are you willing if the ceremony should be postponed until another week, in order that due notice might be given to the congregation. Sabbath day is the place! Now Joseph's mood, during his famous walk, and while he had been waiting in the basement, had been greatly exercised and disturbed by a most distressing nature. In a word, he feared that the solitude of his present circumstances, as a burden, in his immediate vicinity, might, perhaps, be affected and impaired by a sudden change. In compliance with the requirement of the law, "For my part," said he, wriggling in his chair, on being replied to Perry Graves' question. "I should like to know whether it's legal or otherwise point to point. If it's legal, it's legal, and I don't see how it can be — I must say I'd rather wait. I'm in such a hurry as to make to break the law." "Humph!" said the Colonel, regarding his nephew with a look of contempt. "Your party, cool-headed, and cool-headed though, for a man of your age, in your sittings." "Sure," said the prisoner, "I admire the distinction and patience which the young man tries. If it's not legal to protect." Led, I cannot persons sing ceremoniously." The Colonel shook his head as a warning to his sister, who, with difficulty, restrained her wrath. "The wedding," said he, "is always a great event, and still looks at the disappointed man with composure, with composure, and I mean just what I say. If you are a man, you must be married to my sister. I must go to urge him; and if Parliament Graves wants to have it, that his publication had to be put out for a minister to act at a wedding, well and good; I've nothing more to say, just now, just now. How, then, that point. "Of course," began the minister. "Ah, for the matter of its being recorded to law, I do not suppose it would be strictly speaking," continued the Colonel, unmindful of the disappointment. "I'll just and explain what I said on that point. You must, Parson," he added, after having read from the book which he held in his hand, "you should have the statement pervaded the usual persimby should be lined in wedlock, without the usual legal notice published in a barroom manuscript." Pulid out. With, though to look, to be sure, at first eight, as if it meant to say in the public. Island, av jinia' — but 'luin't mi, atid tt don't mean so; for tba thiril fectJou here penidc?. tbal, t-f any juMico er minister shall jint mij person in marriage — shall ji^u auy person In marriage — shall ji^u auy person In marriage, "withly be increased empaeisi tmd looking up over his spectacles at the Parsif, "without being first published, they shall pay a fine of seven dollars, Now just look at the matter. Sons are married without being published, they're their jingles or they njn'l jined. If they are jined, why they are jined, and that's all that's wanted, and if they don't jined they ain't jined, and that their section is all nyni and dull, don't meet nothings, and can't be broke; and if they. It's the case, what on earth did the Legislature put it into the law for? But you see it does mean something, and can be broke, and it is the offenders that persons can be jined in marriage, who haven't been published; only those that perform the ceremony and do so. When it comes to doing, and it is liable to pay the penalty, then the law is broken, and it is liable to pay the penalty. Here the Colonel paused, and, having got a little heated, he took off his spongy and walked his forehead with his hands. "Just so," said Mrs. Sweeny, to whom, nevertheless, the Colonels' exposition of the morning of the statute had been wholly incomprehensible. "It's as plain as plain that we all exactly according to the law," said Colonel, "I think I understand your argument, Colonel," said the Parson, who had listened attentively, sitting, meanwhile, very straight and upright in his chair, with his hands resting on the top of his chair, his eyebrows and a little elevated, and his head cocked tightly to one side. "Allow me to see the book," he added, putting on his spectacles — "ah! yes — section third — um-m — any minister— um-m-hall pay— sixty-seven dollars— um-m-m — one moiety — um-m — and so forth: j-eji, Colonel, I think you're right; and, with respect to the fine." "Why!" "Of course, you won't lose nothing in that way!" cried the Colonel with great emphasis — "the Deacon and I will stand in that gap, if need be; they." Deacon! "Yes, of course," replied Deacon Sweeny, under the strait duress of his wife's glance. "I'll be willing to give twice the money, just to see the fellow that's there to prosecute," cried the Colonel, snatching the table with his fist. "Nove the truth," remarked the Parson, "I must confess I like not the idea of infringing the law of the land, even when I may do so with impunity. It becomes not those to whom authority is entrusted to use it in a manner which is by law forbidden." "Well, Parson," said the Colonel; "as for that, I suppose I'm in authority as much as you be; and, though as a general thing I intend to be a law-abiding man, which I ought to be as a citizen and a friend, and particularly as a magistrate, I'd use as not tell you that I expect I've broken this identical statute more than fifty times. If a couple looks old enough to have a right to be married as they please, I just can't be without being too curious." "Is it possible!" cried the Parson; "and that's the secret of the reason why young people..." From beyond the line, Heck your house so much more frequently than mine, as I have heard?" "Kzackly," replied the Colonel, with a shrewd smile; "now you've found it out, you'll be getting my business away from me — now you've learned the trick of my trade; and a pretty good business it is, too, about this time of year. Last Thanksgiving night, when we got home from Andrew's and Sally's wedding, up to the Deacon's here, you're looking, we found two couples waiting to be joined; didn't we, Betsey? and I joined them, too; though, I haven't more time they were published, than I have they were bound — not a bit." Encouraged by these precedents.

Processing sample 13/600 (dataset index: 12)
Processing sample 13 (dataset index 12) with language 'en'
Article: In some embodiments, a proof mass is added to extension 122 to separateits resonant frequency from that of cantilever 104 as a whole. It shouldbe noted, however, that, in such embodiments, temperature effects arenot compensated completely. This is due to the fact that the thermalload is different between the strain sensors connected to extension 122because the thermal capacitance of the proof mass loads only thepiezoresistors of strain sensors 708-1 and 708-2. In addition, ascantilever 104 resonates, a forced-convection effect on sensor 120 isunbalanced because strain sensors 708-1 and 708-2 deflect farther thanstrain sensors 708-3 and 708-4 due to the arcuate path of verticalactuator 118. As a result, the piezoresistors 710 included in strainsensors 708-1 and 708-2 experience more cooling than the piezoresistorsincluded in strain sensors 708-3 and 708-4.
It should be noted that, when the piezoresistor of a strain sensor 708is close to surface 124, heat transfer can occur between the surface andthe piezoresistor through the intervening environment. Becausecantilever 104 is typically oriented at an angle to surface 124 when SPM100 is engaged with, or approaching, the surface, strain sensors 708-1and 708-2 are closer to surface 124 than strain sensors 708-3 and 708-4.As a result, more heat transfer occurs between the surface and strainsensors 708-1 and 708-2 than between the surface and strain sensors708-3 and 708-4. This gives rise to a differential signal that isindicative of the separation between probe tip 106 and surface 124.
In some embodiments, this differential signal is measured and exploitedto improve the control and speed with which SPM 100 can be brought intoengagement with a sample surface. This capability represents asignificant advantage over prior-art SPM systems, which typically employa “hunt-and-seek” method for bringing a probe tip into its measurementposition.
 An exemplary approach for bringing SPM 100 into engagement with sample112 includes:

-   -   i. moving sample 112 (or at least one of sample 112 and SPM 100)        at a first rate to reduce the separation between surface 124 and        probe tip 106;    -   ii. measuring a first output signal based on the resistance of        strain sensors 708-1 and 708-2;    -   iii. measuring a second output signal based on the resistance of        strain sensors 708-3 and 708-4;    -   iv. computing the difference between the first and second output        signals; and    -   v. stopping the motion of sample 112 when the difference reaches        a predetermined value that is based on the desired separation        between surface 124 and probe tip 106.
In some cases, the point at which the motion of sample 112 is stoppedleaves the separation between the sample and probe tip at anintermediate separation that can be safely established while moving thesample at the first rate. Once this intermediate separation isestablished in operation (v), the separation between the sample and theprobe tip can be changed at a slower rate to establish the desiredseparation.
In some embodiments, an identical proof mass is added to each ofextensions 122 and 710. In such embodiments, DC thermal compensation isimproved, since both proof masses experience the same convective coolingunder quasi-static conditions. When the cantilever is in resonance,however, the proof mass added to extension 122 experiences greaterconvective cooling than the proof mass added to extension 122.
Although the illustrative embodiment includes two strain sensors locatedon either side of coupling beam 704, in some embodiments, a singlestrain sensor is included on either side of the coupling beam. In someembodiments, more than two strain sensors are located on either side ofcoupling beam 704.
 In some embodiments, strain sensors 708-3 and 708-4 are locatedelsewhere in cantilever 104 such that they are unaffected by strain dueto tip-sample interaction but do experience the same (or similar)thermal conditions as strain sensors 708-1 and 708-2. Suchconfigurations enable analogous compensation of TCR and parasitic straineffects as described above.
It should be noted that the location of piezoresistors 710 in the layerstructure of as-formed CMOS-MEMS beam 712 is not ideal because itsresponsivity is limited due to the CMOS BEOL layer structure itself. Itis yet another aspect of the present invention, however, that theresponsivity of a strain sensor can be improved by including a simplepost-processing operation to change the neutral axis of beams 712 afterrelease of extensions 122 and 710 and singulation of the SPM die.
In some embodiments, cantilever 104 includes a heater, such as heater506, where the heater is arranged to provide periodic excitation to eachof temperature sensors located similarly to strain sensors 708. Thisenables the use of lock-in measurements that can further suppress driftand band-limit the measurement of the tip-sample thermal interactions.Typically, this heater is located on coupling beam 704.
FIG. 8A depicts a schematic drawing of a cross-sectional view of strainsensor 708 in its as-formed state at the completion of a conventionalCMOS process. In strain sensor 708, piezoresistor 710 is located verynear the neutral axis of beam 712. As a bending moment develops in thebeam, therefore, piezoresistor 710 is subjected to only slight strain.
 FIG. 8B depicts a schematic drawing of a cross-sectional view of analternative piezoresistive strain sensor in accordance with the presentinvention. Strain sensor 804 is analogous to strain sensor 708; however,a portion of silicon dioxide layer 518 is removed from strain sensor 804using a backside oxide etch. As a result, the neutral axis of beam 712is shifted upward and away from piezoresistor 710 enabling significantlymore strain to develop in piezoresistor 710. This provides strain sensor804 with increased strain sensitivity—up to a 500% improvement in strainsensitivity (a >12 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) ascompared to strain sensor 708.
It should be noted that the backside oxide etch can easily be performedafter the mechanically active elements of SPM 100 (including cantilever104) have been released from substrate 110 in a sacrificial etch, aswell as after die singulation is performed (typically via a “scribe andbreak” operation). Once the individual die (or rows of die) have beenseparated, cantilever 104 projects over chip edge 124, as depicted inFIG. 1. As a result, when the oxide etch is performed from the backsideof the chip, only the region in which piezoresistors 710 are located isexposed since the substrate acts as a mask that protects the remainingstructure.
 FIG. 8C depicts a schematic drawing of a cross-sectional view of anotheralternative piezoresistive strain sensor in accordance with the presentinvention. Strain sensor 806 is analogous to strain sensor 708; however,a portion of silicon dioxide layer 518 is removed from the backside ofcantilever 104 thereby exposing tungsten vias 802. After removal of thepolysilicon material, it is replaced with piezoresistive material 808,which is an alternative piezoresistive material having higherpiezoresistivity than polysilicon (e.g., SiC, etc.). Piezoresistivematerial 808 is typically deposited onto the devices through ashadow-mask. The use of a higher piezoresistivity material in thepiezoresistor further improves the SNR (signal to noise ratio) of thestrain sensor.
Although the illustrative embodiment includes a vertical actuator thatprovides arcuate deflection of probe tip 106, in some embodiments it ispreferable to use a rotating actuator for vertical actuator 118.
FIG. 9A depicts a schematic drawing of a first alternative verticalactuator in accordance with the present invention. Actuator 900 is anisothermal rotating actuator comprising torsion elements 902-1 and902-2, proof masses 908-1 and 908-2, coupling beam 704, sensor 120,extensions 122 and 712, and probe tip 106.
Each of torsion elements 902-1 and 902-2 includes a plurality ofbimorphs 904, which are grouped into operative sets. Adjacent operativesets are rigidly interconnected via beams 906 such that bending of theoperative sets within a torsion element is additive.
Torsion elements 902-1 and 902-2 are rigidly connected to platform 116via rigid links 910 and arranged such that they rotate about rotationaxis 912 in the same direction when subjected to opposite temperaturechanges. As a result, their collective power dissipation remainsconstant during operation. It should be noted that, in thisconfiguration, coupling beam 704 operates as a third shuttle (analogousto shuttle 304) in an isothermal actuator that rotates the coupling beamand extensions 122 and 712 about rotation axis 912.
 It should be noted that the cantilever depicted in FIG. 9A includesproof masses 908-1 and 908-2, which are physically connected withextensions 122 and 712, respectively. Further, extensions 122 and 712are connected to coupling beam 704 through the sensor elements of sensor120.
Actuator 900 substantially doubles the signal that can be attained usingvertical actuator 118 because it places the piezoresistors in sensor 120in resonance with 180° of relative phase shift. Furthermore, thisconfiguration compensates AC temperature fluctuations, since the thermalload seen by all resistors is the same.
It should also be noted that this configuration also balances theparasitic thermal coupling effects described above and with respect tostrain sensors 708 depicted in FIG. 7.
Finally, the use of an isothermal vertical actuator, such as actuator900, also enables complete isothermal operation of a scanning probemicroscope.
FIG. 9B depicts a schematic drawing of a portion of a cantilever havinga sensor configuration that is particularly well suited for use withvertical actuator 900. Cantilever 914 includes strain sensors 708-1through 708-4, extension 122, probe tip 106, proof mass 908, and rigidlinks 910.
Strain sensors 708 are arranged in pairs on either side of rotation axis918. As a result, tip-sample forces imparted on probe tip 106 give riseto a torque at the base of extension 122, which rotates about rotationaxis 918. This rotation gives rise to equal and opposite strains in thepiezoresistors located on opposite sides of the rotation axis.
It should be noted that, although the arrangement of strain sensors insensor 916 is particularly well suited for operation with verticalactuator 900, it is suitable for use in any of the SPM arrangementsdescribed herein.
 FIG. 10 depicts a schematic drawing of a second alternative verticalactuator in accordance with the present invention. Actuator 1000 ispiston-style vertical actuator comprising elevators 1002-1 through1002-3 and plate 1004. Typically probe tip 106 (not shown) projectsupward from the center of plate 1004.
Elevators 1002-1 through 1002-3 (referred to, collectively, as elevators1002) are mechanically coupled with platform 116. Each of elevators 1002is a serial combination of alternating bimorph elements 1006 andstraight beams 1008. As a result, flexure of the bimorph elements isadditive. In addition, the configuration also provides mechanicalamplification of the flexure of the bimorph elements by virtue ofstraight beams 1008.
In some embodiments, actuator 1000 is arranged as an isothermal actuatorby providing matching upward-actuating elevators and downward-actuatingelevators, as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070001248,which is incorporated herein by reference.
FIG. 11 depicts a schematic drawing of a probe tip in accordance withthe illustrative embodiment. Probe tip 106 includes core 1102, conductorring 1104, and interlayer dielectric 1106.
Core 1102 includes portions of aluminum layers 526 and 530, as describedabove and with respect to FIG. 5B.
Conductor ring 1104 is a portion of aluminum layer 528.
Interlayer dielectric 1106 includes portions of silicon dioxide layers522 and 524. Interlayer dielectric 1106 electrically isolates core 1102and conductor ring 1104 such that they can be used as separateelectrical contacts, if desired. In such embodiments, conductiveinterconnects are typically formed to provide separate signal routing tocore 1102 and conductor ring 1104.
It should be noted that, while AFM applications do not typically requirean electrically active probe tip, such as element is desirable in someembodiments of the present invention.
 In some embodiments, after its formation, a layer of another material isformed on the exposed surface of the probe tip 106 to furtherfunctionalize the probe. For example, in some embodiments, a layer ofvanadium oxide is deposited on probe tip 106 (by e.g., plasma-vapordeposition, pulsed-laser deposition, etc., through a shadow mask) suchthat it forms a continuous layer between core 1102 and conductor ring1104. The resultant structure would be suitable for use as a bolometerprobe, among other applications.
In some embodiments, the exposed surface of probe tip 106 is coated witha different material to enable different or augmented capabilities, suchmagnetic field detection, electret behavior, specific binding to ananalyte of interest, improved wear properties, and the like.
FIG. 12 depicts an alternative probe tip structure in accordance withthe present invention. Probe tip 1200 includes temperature sensors1202-1 and 1202-2 and isolators 1204.
Each of temperature sensors 1202-1 and 1202-2 is a thermocouple-styletemperature sensors (based on the Seebeck effect).
Each of isolators 1204 is a region of patterned silicon dioxide thatinhibits the flow of heat to and from temperature sensors 1202-1 and1202-2.
Temperature sensors 1202-1 and 1202-2 are arranged on opposite sides ofcoupling beam 704. As described above, vis-à-vis sensor 120, thedifferential arrangement of the temperature sensors compensates forthermal coupling effects from the scanning actuators. In someembodiments, temperature sensors 1202-1 and 1202-2 are bolometer-styletemperature sensors (based on the TCR of their constituent materials).
Although the illustrative embodiment employs a Cartesian two-dimensionalactuator for moving platform 116 about the scanning region, in somecases, it is desirable to scan probe tip 106 in a cylindrical fashion.By reconfiguring the arrangement of SC-actuators 202 and tethers 206, atwo-dimensional isothermal scanner can be provided for moving platform116 within plane 208.
 FIG. 13 depicts a schematic drawing of an alternative two-dimensionalisothermal thermal actuator in accordance with the present invention.Actuator 1300 is a two-dimensional isothermal cylindrical actuatorcomprising SC-actuators 302-1 through 302-4, shuttles 304-1 and 304-2,rigid beams 1302-1 and 1302-2, and flexures 1304, which are collectivelyoperative for moving platform 116 selectively within x-y plane 308. Asnoted above, x-y plane 308 is substantially parallel with the plane ofunderlying substrate 110.
SC-actuators 302-1 and 302-2 are mechanically coupled to collectivelydefine one-dimensional isothermal actuator 310-1 and SC-actuators 302-3and 302-4 are mechanically coupled to collectively defineone-dimensional isothermal actuator 310-2, as described above and withrespect to FIG. 6.
Shuttles 304-1 and 304-2 are coupled to platform 116 via flexures 1304and rigid beams 1302-1 and 1302-2, respectively.
Like straps 502, flexures 1304 are selectively flexible in plane 308;however, flexures 1304 are expressly designed to enable both rotationand translation of platform 116 about point 1306. Point 1306 is thecenter of rotation for cantilever 104.
Cantilever 104 rotates about point 1306 in response to motion ofshuttles 304-1 and 304-2 in opposite direction along the y-axis.Cantilever 104 translates radially to or away from point 1306 inresponse to motion of shuttles 304-1 and 304-2 in the same directionalong the y-axis. Because of the arrangement of SC-actuators 302actuators 310, each of these motions can be effected with asubstantially constant power dissipation at each of actuators 310. As aresult, actuator 1300 can maintain the same thermal distributionthroughout the entire range motion of platform 118.

A light extraction characteristic of the LED element in accordance withthe embodiment was evaluated by simulation.

This LED element 500 is an example of a red lightemitting element.
The transparent substrate 510 is assumed to be made of soda-lime. Inaddition, the light scattering layer 520 is assumed to be made of aglass base material including, in mol % representation, 23.9% of P₂O₅,12.4% of B₂O₃, 5.2% of Li₂O, 15.6% of Bi₂O₃, 16.4% of Nb₂O₅, 21.6% ofZnO, and 4.9% of ZrO₂. Because the transparent substrate 510 and thelight scattering layer 520 may be regarded as being media for finallyoutputting light, thicknesses thereof are assumed to be 0.

The radiance (W/Sr·m²) of light emitted from the side of the transparentsubstrate 510 of the LED element 500 having the layer structureillustrated in FIG. 5, in a range of the wavelength of 400 nm to 800 nm,is calculated by simulation. The thickness of each of the layers havingthe variable thickness is added to a variable, and a combination of thethicknesses for a case in which a maximum radiance of light emitted isobtained in a direction perpendicular to the element is calculated inthe simulation. Actually, the light incident to the light scatteringlayer is scattered, and reflected at the interface between the lightscattering layer and the glass substrate, and thus, the luminance oflight perpendicularly emitted from the substrate and the luminance oflight perpendicularly incident to the light scattering layer do notmatch. However, it may be regarded that, when the luminance of lightperpendicularly incident to the light scattering layer is high, theluminance of light emitted to the atmosphere perpendicularly from thesubstrate also becomes high. In a case in which the element is formed onthe substrate having the glass scattering layer having the highrefractive index, the angle dependency of the emitted light follows theCos θ rule, and thus, it may be estimated that the amount of luminousflux of the emitted light as a whole is large when the luminance of thelight emitted in the perpendicular direction from the substrate is high.
 In addition, a SETFOS (vendor: Cybernet Systems) manufactured by FLUXiMis used for the simulation.
(Results)

The results of the simulation are shown in a column labeled “Case 3” inthe following Table 2.
TABLE 2 Layer Thickness Hole Light Electron Electron First SecondTransport Emitting Transport Injection Calculated Result Layer LayerLayer Layer Layer Layer Radiance Case 530 (nm) 540 (nm) 561 (nm) 562(nm) 563 (nm) 564 (nm) (W/Sr · m²) Magnification Case 1 — — 85 20 70 0.59031 1 Case 2 — 70 90 20 70 0.5 10907 1.21 Case 3 300 70 85 20 70 0.511683 1.29

Table 2 shows the radiance of light emitted perpendicularly from theelement, for a case (Case 1) in which no first layer 530 and no secondlayer 540 are provided in FIG. 5, and also for a case (Case 2) in whichthe second layer 540 is provided but no first layer 530 is provided, forcomparison purposes. In addition, the column labeled “Magnification” foreach case indicates the magnification of the radiance for each case withreference to the radiance (W/Sr·m²) obtained for the Case 1.
Furthermore, Table 2 also shows the thickness of each layer when themaximum radiance is obtained for each case.
From Table 2, it may be seen that the radiance is improved toapproximately 1.3 times for the Case 3 provided with the first andsecond layers 530 and 540, when compared to the Case 1 in which no firstand second layers 530 and 540 are provided. Hence, it may be confirmedthat the radiance (W/Sr·m²) of the light emitted from the side of thetransparent substrate 510 greatly improves by the provision of the firstand second layers 530 and 540.

This LED element 600 is an example of a greenlight emitting element.
The transparent substrate 610 is assumed to be made of soda-lime. Inaddition, the light scattering layer 620 is assumed to be made of aglass base material including, in mol % representation, 23.9% of P₂O₅,12.4% of B₂O₃, 5.2% of Li₂O, 15.6% of Bi₂O₃, 16.4% of Nb₂O₅, 21.6% ofZnO, and 4.9% of ZrO₂. Because the transparent substrate 610 and thelight scattering layer 620 may be regarded as being media for finallyoutputting light, as described above, thicknesses thereof are assumed tobe 0.
The first layer 630 is assumed to be made of titanium oxide (TiO₂), witha thickness of 300 nm.
The second layer 640 is assumed to be made of titanium zirconium complexoxide (TiZr_(x)O_(y)), with a thickness variable in a range of 10 nm to200 nm.
The first electrode 650 is assumed to have a 2-layer structure includinga first layer 651 and a second layer 652, both made of ITO. In addition,the thickness of both layers is assumed to be 75 nm.
The organic light emitting layer 660 is assumed to have a 3-layerstructure including a hole transport layer 661, a light emitting layer662, and an electron injection layer 663.
 The hole transport layer 661 is assumed to be made of NPD, with athickness variable in a range of 10 nm to 200 nm. The light emittinglayer 662 is assumed to be made of Alq₃, with a thickness variable in arange of 10 nm to 200 nm. The electron injection layer 663 is assumed tobe made of LiF, with a thickness of 0.5 nm.
The second electrode 670 is assumed to be formed by an aluminum layerhaving a thickness of 80 nm.
(Results)

The results of the simulation are shown in a column labeled “Case 6” inthe following Table 3.

Table 3 shows the radiance of light emitted perpendicularly from theelement, for a case (Case 4) in which no first layer 630 and no secondlayer 640 are provided in FIG. 6, and also for a case (Case 5) in whichthe second layer 640 is provided but no first layer 630 is provided, forcomparison purposes. In addition, the column labeled “Magnification” foreach case indicates the magnification of the radiance for each case withreference to the radiance (W/Sr·m²) obtained for the Case 4.
Furthermore, Table 3 also shows the thickness of each layer when themaximum radiance is obtained for each case.
 From Table 3, it may be seen that the radiance is improved toapproximately 1.1 times for the Case 6 provided with the first andsecond layers 630 and 640, when compared to the Case 4 in which no firstand second layers 630 and 640 are provided. Hence, it may be confirmedthat the radiance (W/Sr·m²) of the light emitted from the side of thetransparent substrate 610 greatly improves by the provision of the firstand second layers 630 and 640.

H. Savagb. OUR POOR RELATIONS. THE ANIMALS. I HAVE chosen four or five difiFeient passages as texts, because I wish you to get in mind the range of expression contained in the Bible on this subject. First, I call your attention, without quoting them, to the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth verses of the first chapter of Genesis in connection and contrast with the twenty-seventh verse. It is where God is represented as having created all the living things below the human, and then, in quite a different way, as having created man. Then in the twenty-fifth chapter of Deuteronomy, at the fourth verse, you will find the words, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the com." In the twelfth chapter of the Book of Proverbs the tenth verse reads as follows: "A righteous man regard- eth the Hfe of his beast, but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel." In the tenth chapter of the Gospel according to Mat- thew the twenty-ninth and thirtieth verses read as fol- lows: "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father: the very hairs of your head are numbered." And then, for the last verse, in the ninth chapter of the First Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, Paul quotes and comments on the verse which I read from Deuter- onomy: **For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the com. Is it for the oxen that God careth, or saith he it alto- gether for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written." If we go far enough back in the history of the world, we come to a time when the chronic relation between man and the animal world was one of warfare. It Mras necessarily so ; but, unfortunately, this condition has left inherited traces which are not yet outgrown. Note the conditions. When men first emerged from the purely animal condition, they were the weakest creatures, almost, on the face of the earth. The huxnan child still is the weakest of all the young that begin their career on this planet. Men had no natural weapons of the ordinary kind with which to fight against their enemies, the animals. For you must remember that the animals were enemies, rivals. They occupied the ground; and, if men were to have any peaceful habitation, they must clear it of these animals or bring them in some way under control. And man had no natural weapons. He was not as strong as a good many other animals. He was not as fleet of foot as other animals. He had no horns nor hoofs nor poisonous sting with which to defend himself. Where did his strength, then, lie ? It was in just that peculiarity which has made him, as the years have gone by, the master of the world. He had a certain added brain power, so that he was wiser than they. He could outwit — that is, out-know — ^his rivals and his enemies. And there was a physical peculiarity. He not only began to stand upon his feet; but this wonderful fact — did you ever think of it ? — that the thumb is opposed to the four fingers in men, and that so they are able to grasp, was apparent. They had hands. And with these hands they could tear off a limb from a tree and use it as a cudgel ; and with this brain power they could think out various devices; they could chip the flint, and so come into possession of knives or spear-heads. They could go on discovering and making various kinds of weapons with which to protect themselves. But for a long period of time men veritably fought for their Uves with the other animals; and the world has not yet, curiously enough, outgrown that condition. Before coming to the present time, however, let me ask you to note something of strange significance in the Bible. I wonder how many of you ever noticed it? Wlien the conquest of Canaan was going on, the Israel- ites are told not to destroy their enemies, the previous possessors of the land, too rapidly, lest the wild beasts increase in such numbers as to threaten their very ex- istence. You see the strenuousness of the warfare in so modem a time as that. But it is going on to-day. Every year in India there are hundreds of thousands of men and women and chil- dren who lose their lives. The tigers, the serpents, the different wild beasts of the jungle, are continually prey- ing upon them. So that men have had to fight the ani- mals in order that they might live. And out of this necessity there have grown up certain inherited feelings of antagonism that we need to-day to outgrow and leave behind. I wish you to note another strange phase of human development. I suppose every nation in the world has passed through this phase. You do not have to go back 90 very far to find it. We find it to-day in our story books, particularly those that the children enjoy. In these books the animals think, can talk, converse with each other and with men. There is a tribe of people of whom I have read — ^I do not this moment recall its name — who to-day tell us that the monkeys might talk if they only would, but that they keep still through fear that they might be set to work if they showed too much intelligence. We do not have to go back too far before we find a time when people believed in identity of life and nat- ure between themselves and the animals. They wer« not so very different a kind of being. They were sub- stantially the same. Indeed, we find that condition of^ things on this continent when it was discovered. You are aware of the fact that many a tribe of Indians traces its descent from some animal that they call the totem of the tribe. They trace back to the tortoise, the bear, the wolf, and so on. And they veritably believed that they were descended from some one of these animals. For these animals possessed the same kind of natures that they did. The gods they worshipped were their own human ancestors, having entered into the spiritual world, become invisible, and endowed in the popular imagination with a tremendous increase of power beyond that which they used to possess when they Hved here. And it might be the souls of some of these ancestors inhabiting the bodies of some of the animals. There was the possibility of intercommunication of Ufe and office in this way. And here is the basis for much of the practice of sacri- fice that has obtained in the past. The people beheved that the animal which was sacrificed was of the same nature as the god, and that they also possessed the same nature as the animal and as the god ; and so in this cere- mony there \^a8 intercommunication of nature and life, a re-establishment of vital bonds between themselves and the god, — ^bonds of worship and obedience on their part, bonds of protection and care on the part of the deity. The next step to which I wish to call your attention was a very easy one to take following this. You are aware of course that perhaps at least a third part of the inhabitants of the world, if not more, still believes in the transmigration of the soul,— not merely that the same soul at different periods of the earth's history may in- habit different human bodies, but that the soul may in- habit the bodies of animals, of birds, of reptiles, of insects, of anything that lives. Being so near to the time when they believed in the practical identity of nature of all the different forms of life, you see how easy it was for an idea like this to spring up. Andy when we go among the Buddhists or to India or to other parts of the world where this belief obtains, we may wonder at the attitude which people maintain towards animals; but we are not to think that it is the kind of tenderness that we think ought to exist to-day towards lo^er creatures. It is fear oftentimes. The people are afraid to kill an animal or a bird. Why ? Lest it may be the body of some man, perhaps some friend, some member of their own family. And in this way they commit sacrilege, they offend the gods, and perhaps as a result they may have to pay the penalty in their next incarnation of wearing precisely this kind of a body which they have cruelly or thoughtlessly de- stroyed. So the fact that among these people they do not eat meat and do not kill animals for sport or in any other way when they can help it is simply because it is a part of their religion. It is not natural, human tenderness for the creatures of the lower world. Now I wish you to note another step; and it is a very curious one. It looks as though we were doubling on our track and going back to the beginning; for what has ^nodem science to teach us to-day concerning the ani- mals? That they are veritably, in all Kteralness, our rela- tions, our relatives. It tells us that there is only one He in the universe, from the least, tiniest globule that we can speak of as living up through all forms of vege- table life, of life in the seas, of life in the jungles, of life in the air, dear up to man, — ^life divine, life in God, life 8 from God, life climbing back towards God. That is the teaching of modem science. So animals, then, — ^these birds, these reptiles, the in- sects, whatever has life, — all these are our relations: they share with us the same life that we share with God. And how many of the qualities that we are proud of as men do they also possess? Animals think, reason. I think they do. If you choose to call the process of mind through which tfcey go **instinct," then be consist- ent, and call it instinct in yourself; for, so far as we can trace it, the two are identical. Animals dream, imagine, remember, love, hate. What superb qualities there are in some of them! There is a faithfulness, a constancy, a devotion, developed in some of the dogs that perhaps does not have its equal any- where else in the world. Human love can be tired out, can be killed by abuse, can be starved. But notice the dog. Let him love and be devoted to a master, and neither hunger nor thirst, nor cold nor neglect, nor abuse^ neither drunkenness nor the lowest degree of that which is disreputable on the part of a man, alienates him. He is faithful, constant, devoted still. And these animals love enough so that they sacrifice their lives for each other and for their young. And they love enough so that they die of grief on the graves of their human masters. And similar things are true of other animals besides the dog. We, then, ought to remember, whatever we do towards the animals, that we stand in this vital relation towards them. Remember what they are and what they are capable of. I shall come back to this with some other ideas before I am through. Now I wish to call your attention to a strange and to me. a very sad fact. Whatever the reason may have been for kindness and tenderness, or apparent kindness 9 and tenderness, in other parts of .the world, and what- ever the reason may have been for the absence of these in Christianity, I believe it to be true — ^it is so far as I have been able to study the matter — that there never has been a period in human history when animals have been so abused, so maltreated, so neglected, treated so inhumanly, as they have been in Christendom for the last nineteen hundred years; and yet we worship a man whose distinguishing quality was gentleness and love, and whom we call the Prince of Peace. I wish to suggest one or two things as having some possible bearing on this strange fact. I have read to you several passages from the Bible this morning by way of texts. I wish you to note two or three of them. In the creation account it is said that God made the animals and the birds and the creeping things of the earth, — ^made them just as he did the clouds and the islands, the continents and the seas. Then he made man in a different way. He made him in his own image, and gave him dominion over all these, set him up above them as a king not only, but as having a right — at any rate, this right has been asserted — of exploiting all these for his own advantage and his own pleasure, just as he happened to feel like doing. There is no command in the Bible anywhere to treat animals kindly, to be specially considerate about them. There is this passage I read about not muzzling the ox when he is treading out the com, — giving him a chance to get a mouthful of food now and then in the process; that is what it means. It is said that the righteous man is merciful to his beast. There is a passage that says even the Sabbath may be bn)ken to get a sheep out of a pit, if he has fallen into it ; but it does not say whether it is on accotmt of mercy to the sheep or to save a man's property. Jesus tells us that God notes even the fall of a sparrow ; lO but a large part of Christianity has followed Paul instead of Jesus both in its theology and in a good many other ways. And you wiU note that Paul quotes the i>assage about the ox when he is tieading the com, and then raises the question as to whether that is because God cares anything about the ox. No, he says, not at all, that is for our sake; and then he goes on and deduces the lesson, saying it .has a moral meaning for men, and •nothing to do with consideration or tenderness for the ox. So there was no distinct and definite Christian com- mand to be kind towards animals. Then let us look at the conditions of things, say, in the Middle Ages. I do not remember the precise cen- tury; but about the time of the ninth Louis in France nearly one-half, if not quite one-half, of the entire area of France was reserved as hunting grounds for the no- bility. And what did the nobles do ? These men who ruled the people by divine right, what were they doing? They were fighting, they were eating and drinking, they were gaming, they were playing at love, or they were hunting; and that is all they did when they were awake. The word '* clerk," a man who could read, was a term of contempt. None of them knew how to read ; and he would have been ashamed of himself if he had known. So there was nothing else for them to do except to en- gage in such occupations as I have spoken of. So every day they found their amusement, when they were not busy about something else, simply in killing something. And it has grown into a habit in Christendom. To-day somebody has said that the young Englishman, when he has nothing more important to do, says, **Let us go and kill something. '* That is his idea of having a good time. And so they travel all over the world, — come here with BufiFalo Bill in the Rocky Mountains, go to Africa ri and India — ^purely for the delight of kilUng something. That is their great idea of having a good time. This is the traditional attitude, then, towards the animals that has been maintained throughout nearly the history of Christendom. I wish now — for I am running over these preUminaries as rapidly as I can — ^to point out to you and ask you to consider with me some of the ways by which we are needlessly cruel, — cruel towards these poor relations of ours, the lower forms of life. In the first place I want to speak again of this matter of sport, about which I have just been talking. I do not wish to be too severe, too hard here. I merely wish to ask people to think a little. The Indians of the plains, whatever else they did, never engaged in this mere sport of killing things for the fun of it. They killed animals to get them out of the way, they killed them for food; but I have never known of a case of their killing them merely for amusement. I have carried a rifle ever since I was able to lift one. I love to shoot. I used to love to shoot at birds and beasts and all sorts of living things; but I was not more than twelve or thirteen years of age before — ^nobody taught it to me — the idea came into my mind that possi- bly it was more amusement for me than it was for them, that possibly they did not enjoy being shot. And, then, the further question came as to whether I had any right to shoot them merely for amusement. And, whether I have decided it rightly or wrongly, I have decided in favor of the animals; and I have never taken any pleasure in killing things since. I do not object to a man's fishing and using what he catches for food; I do not object to his going into the woods and shooting game for food; but I never could quite see the prowess of going into the woods merely to shoot a moose or a deer or a bear, something that is 12 possessed of a wonderful life, a magnificent life, which you can take away in a moment, but cannot give back again. How any man can look in the clear, soft, deep eye of one of these wild creatures, and then pull the trigger of his rifle, I cannot understand. It seems to me that it is not the highest type of what we think of as human, — this merely killing things for amusement. And there is another aspect of the case. We are cruel as the result of the commercial spirit. We assume, for example, that we have a perfect right to take possession of a wild horse and tame him for our uses, and then that he is a piece of property, he is an engine, or a ma- chine, containing so much force, and we have a right to use that force for our advantage, to use it up in a year or ten or five, or any number we please, just as it happens to suit our convenience, and then we have a right to fling him away as a worn-out bit of machinery, and replace him with a new one. That is the assumption; and so you will find street railways, for example, estimating the length of life of a horse. And in a gfood many different departments of the world it is the same. They use them up just as fast as it pays to use them up, and then get a new supply. The question as to whether the horse likes it or suffers in the process does not come up for consideration or as to whether we have a right in this way to exploit the lives of our poor relations. This seems never to be considered. I never could understand how, if a man has had a horse that he has learned to love, a horse that has served him well for several years, how he can turn that horse oflf when he gets a little past the best time of his life, let him go into the common market, let him get into the hands of anybody who will wring the last drop of 13 vitality out of him before flinging him to the rubbish heap. If I were a man of means and had a horse that I liked, I would turn him out to pasture in his old age, or, if I could not do that, I would put him into the hands of somebody I knew who would use him kindly and care- fully, and then put him to a painless end. Or, if I could not do either of these things, I would put him out of the way myself. I would not turn him over into what is ahnost of necessity certain last years of suffering, of cruelty, of neglect. There is another way in which we are cruel. We are cruel through vanity. And here the tender-hearted and loving women are the most pitiless sinners of all. Cer- tain creatures, certain birds, are almost exterminated, merely for ornament; and they tell us that some of them are caught and put to death for their plumage just at the time of the year when it means suffering and starva- tion and death for their helpless young. And women, tender-hearted, and who would faint at the sight of a drop of blood, calling themselves religious, will deck themselves out with these trophies of atro- cious cruelty, and then go into the house of God and bend their heads meekly in a hideous mockery of devotion. Men are guilty along these lines of vanity as well. Men want their horses to make a fine appearance on the street, so they adopt the overhead check, put into their mouths a bit that is torment, so that they will appear alive, restless. They dock their tails. They will do all sorts of things purely out of vanity, to make a finer display on the street. I wish these people who do these things could have some parallel thing in their own case for a little while, a bit like this in their own mouths, their own heads tipped Iwtck, and held there until it was torture. The docking is not so bad so long as the horse is in the hands of a kind 14 and careful and wealthy master; but, turned out in his old age, it becomes a source of positive suffering and cruelty. Then there is the cruelty that comes from thought- lessness,— thoughtlessness on the part of men and women. I feel like quoting here a saying of Dr. John- son. Mrs. Thrale was taken to task one day by the doctor for something which she had said or done; and she defended herself by saying, "I didn't think." "Bat, madame," said the doctor, **you have no right not to think." And, when it touches questions of ri^ht or wrong, cruelty or kindness, neither men nor women have any right not to think. Brains were given us for the express purpose of enabling us to think. How many people, not perhaps in the city so much, but in the country through, cause cruelty to the animals by forgetting to feed them, because it is not quite con- venient at a certain time to let them have any drink, neglect them in all sorts of ways, let them suffer from exposure to the cold ! And in the case of our dogs and cats, our household companions and pets, how much of cruelty there is the round year through which is the result of not being will- ing to take a little trouble or from thoughtfulness! You will find people in the spring shut up their houses and go to the country, and turn the household cat loose to starve or annoy the neighbors on the streets. In a hundred ways — I merely suggest them: you know what they are, if you will only stop and think — we are cruel because we are selfish, we are thoughtless, we are not willing to take trouble. And I want to hint in regard to the unconscious cruelty on the part of children. Boys run through and sum up the development of the race from the time they are bom until they get to be men. They pass through a period when they are nothing but barbarians; and barbarism 15 docs not always mean purposed cnidt>\ It means not thinking, ddliglit in animal acthrity, no matter what it costs anything else. So you win find boys — I have been one mysdf — in- stinctively hmi a stone at a binL until every bird in the neighboriiood is frightened when they see a boy oome in sight, — ^jnst because they want to try their skill or see something move; and so they torment dogs and cats and every wild creature of the woods, merely out of the ex- uberance of their tendency to play, to see things go. Why do I speak of this? Because we have power to help oar children to do a fitde thfnking as they grow up. and teach them to be a little kindly. There is no child, I think, who goes into our PSark and sees the squirrels nm up and feed out of his hand, who is not capable of learning that that is a sweeter, finer relation than it would be if the squirrd took to its heels the moment a boy came in sight. Teach them the delight and wonder of our relations to the animal worid, and to live in kindliness and s^-m- pathy towards them. There is one other form of cruelty that I must speak of; and that is the cruelty of modem science in the way of viWsection. I am not going to express myself over- nidically on this subject. I am not at all sure that there have not been cases of vi\*isection which have been justi- fied by the result. There may be cases to-day. I am told by the best autlnmties that there are. But I am inclined to believe that it is unjustifiably overdone, and that there is a large amount of cruelty that public sentiment ought to condemn. If disease can be prevented and life saved in this way, it may be justifiable. But surely it should be reduced to the lowest possible minimnm ; and the methods should be made as humane as possible. So I believe we ought to cultivate a healthy public i6 sentiment in this direction and prevent these different kinds of cruelty so far as we may. Are we responsible ? Here in New York every day are scenes still to make your heart ache, — ^horses overloaded. I walk down Fifth Avenue every morning in the year, and frequently I see from one to half a dozen horses fallen on the asphalt. The head of our Street Cleaning Department the other day told us it was entirely un- necessary, and that it was not the fault of his department, but the fault of our method of sprinkling the streets instead of having them thoroughly and efficiently cleansed. Let us feel ourselves responsible. As the old men in the anti-slavery days here in the North felt themselves responsible for the lash on the backs of the slaves in the South, let us all feel responsible for this needless, this preventable cruelty. How many of us would be willing to take the trouble to give an hour, if necessary, for a complaint against a case of cruelty, to go into court if it were necessary to testify? I should shrink from it, I know, a great many times. I hope, however, I should be decent enough to do it in spite of the shrinking. Let us hold ourselves responsible for these things until we have done every- thing we can to prevent them. And — ^at the end — I have said that men have as- sumed that they had a right to the service of these ani- mals. I am willing to concede that we have a right — if it was a question of a right between the life of an animal and our own — to put the animal out of the way. I am not willing to take the attitude of the vegetarian, and say that we have no right to kill them for food. But have the animals any rights ? We have trained horses, we have domesticated the dog and the cat and a good many other animals that we do not use in the way of labor, but simply keep for our amusement. 17 Have we a right by force to take possession of these independent Hves? I will not discuss that; I simply raise that question; but in all humanity, if we do ex- ercise the power, whether it is a right or not, is it not perfectly clear that we have no right to make slaves of them first and then be inhumanly cruel by the year afterwards? If we take them into our possession and use them for our service and our pleasure, the least we can do is to treat them as well as we know how, and to give them at least comfort, good shelter, food, drink, a little passing kindliness, — to treat them fairly well. I think they have rights. They have just as much right in one way as you or I ; and the tiniest thing, the one whose life is the briefest, ought we not to treat it with peculiar consideration? Here is a little insect. It is going to live only an hour, dancing, fluttering in the sunshine. Shall we not let him have that little hour? What is the use of killing Hm, merely for a whim, the exercise of superfluous power on our part? The animals have a right to live, a right to whatever enjojrment they can get out of life, — just as much right as you or I. Let us concede that right. And let us remember that, if we do not do it for their sakes, we ought to do it for our own. A man ought to be — ^not a gentleman (the word *' gentleman" has been so abused that it does not convey the idea I mean) : he ought to be a gentle man, for his own sake, for the sake of realiz- ing the ideal of his own nobility of nature. Cowper said, you know, that he would not number on his list of friends the man "Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm." Wliy not give the worm a chance to live his little life ? At any rate, we ought to cultivate kindUness for the i8 sake of God, for the sake of our own nattires, for the sake of the same divine and human nature which they share, for the sake of biotherliness, and of love, and make it a part of our religion. Remember that beautiful verse — I could not preach on this subject without quoting it — from **The Ancient Mariner," — "He prayeth best who loveth best All things, both great and small; For the dear God, who loveth us. He made and loves them all." Father, let this same spirit of tenderness and S3rmpathy which is Thy nature be ours, and let us be kindly, not only to each other, but to whatever can suffer or enjoy.

SAVAGE SUc 5Xx7^ Indicsi pas:et, 226; price, 90 oenti net; by niailt 99 cents Dr. Savage is acknowledged to be one of the foremost preachers of liberal religion in this country, and his books, whether on religions or other subjects, have a wide circulation among many dififerent classes of people. In this last volume each chapter deals with car- dinal points of religious belief from the author's Unitarian point of view. "The God we Worship," "The Christ we Love,*' "The Heaven we Hope for," '*The Hell we Fear," indicate the line of topics treated. The foundation truths of religion cannot be too often emphasized or repeated, and when such wholesome religious teachings can be put into Dr. Savage's own simple, direct, reasonable, and forceful way, the resulting volume appeals to all who are willing to be guided by clear and fearless thinking. The chapters of this particular book go far to clear up confused popular ideas about the subjects dealt with. The pillars upon which this temple is reared are sturdy colunms of rational religious conceptions which devoutly concern the development of the higher life. Rev.

8 Claims. (01. 103-103) Y My invention relates to centrifugal pumps and more particularly to that type of centrifugal pump wherein there is an open impeller which operates in a concentric pumping channel and the impeller blades sweep type may be designated as the concentric type.
Since any centrifugal pump consists essentially the channel; This s of only one moving part, that is, the impeller, and

size and cost of the pump and of its driving.
motor.
The present invention is peculiarly applicable to self-priming centrifugal pumps. Self-priming centrifugal pumps have two inherently conflicting requirements, namely, rapid and efficient air removal during priming and efficiency and effectiveness in liquid pumping. The first phase relates to pumping, air and the second phase to pumping liquid, which is usually about 700 times as heavy. In prior designs it has generally been the case that one function has had to sufier in order to secure improvement in the other. The present invention removes, in large part, the limitations of known designs and allows of a marked increase in efficiency and delivery in liquid pumping'while retaining the air-handling abilities of the best prior art constructions. The principle of the present invention releases the designer from prior limitations.
 The basic concept of the present improvement in centrifugal pumps of the aforesaid known types is to deliver into the throat or. throats liquid at maximum pressure only and to prevent, as much as possible, thedelivery of liquid atiess than maximum pressure. In other words, each impeller blade is to be caused to deliver into the throat liquid at the highest mean pressure that the pump is capable of delivering for the particular demand made upon it, that is, the rate of delivery. How this concept is realized will now be disclosed by reference to what goes on in a pump of this class.
I have analyzed the operation of a pump of this type as follows:

Assume a concentric pump with the discharge closed off and the impeller rotating at the rated speed. The liquid between the vanes is now whirled like a flywheel. It is prevented from flying apart or outwardly not by its own coherence, as in a metal flywheel, but by the concentric restraining walls of the channel and pumping chamber. The force of a particle at any particular radius, tending to discharge tangentially (that is. out through a tangential discharge port), is a function of the square of the radius. This is known. Each particle retains its position by virtue of the opposing forces which restrain it. The inertia of motion-the inherent energy which it possesses-tends to make a particle continue in a straight line. The curved channel walls exert an inward force which cause the particle to move in a curved path.
 Considering the circular mass of liquid as made up of successive concentric cylindrical laminae, the outermost layer has maximum velocity because it lies at the outermost radius, and it has inherent energy proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity.
Now as the discharge is opened up, it is apparent that the theoretically perfect pump will cause the outermost laminae to be discharged as an outflowing ribbon of an aggregate rate of how exactly equal to the rate of flow of the permitted discharge. This would supply the discharge for each value at the highest'possible effectiveness and pressure. As the discharge is further opened up, the discharge ribbon would have to take in more laminae and be thicker, so as to make up the cross section required for discharge.
In the construction of a pump of commercial form there are practical considerations which heretofore have not been met without serious compromises, such compromises showing so great an interference with theoretical considerations that the efliciency does not approach the ideal.
 First, in any'commercial pump the throating must be initially fixed as great enough in size to permit outflow of the full discharge at maximum capacity for which the pump is designed. Second, while the water is within the control of the impeller and the casing, the'relation of pressures according to the square of the radius is fairly well maintained, but the moment that the water leaves .the impeller and therestraint of the circular guiding channel is lost and the water passes into a throat, the pressure throughout the cross section of the outwardly flowing stream must be equalized. Third, the motion of the liquid within the pump casing and channel is not a simple or single motion. The movement of the particles of water is very complex, particularly during the acceleration of liquid when the pump is pumping.
disturbing factor in and of itself. The prior art has provided no means for overcoming difliculties produced by the ports themselves, in the following respects:

1. As the impellerblades pass over the ports the blades set up eddies and disturbances in the throat because the contents of the throat are displaceable.
2. As liquid tends to leave the-impeller to pass into the throat, the layers of water which theoretically are maintained in the impeller and casing are no longer .segregated, as would be de- 'sired in the ideal pump. Instead, liquid from widely different layers is permitted to enter the port, causing violent disturbance in attempting to equalize the pressures at difierent points in the throat. a

3. The particles of water at the maximum radius have maximum energy and when they enefliciency will be reduced by the necessity for equalization of the high energy liquid with 'liq-' uid of lower energy than is required for making up the discharge.
 Heretofore the prior art has attempted to remove the outermost or high energy water by a succession of throats of small capacity, operating a good deal as a plane does upon aboard to take off a shaving from the outermost periphery.
' This has been conceived as the most efiective way of trying to get a high energy liquid drawn oil? at the periphery through multiple difiuser ports and then equalized in a channel or manifold prior to discharge.
According to the present invention, I have departed completely from the theory of the multiple throat difiuser and have provided a single throat capable of taking ofi a ribbonof waterof variable depth according to the rate of permitted discharge, but always allowing the water of high energy to take first place in making up the discharge, so that upon equalization'of the pressure of successive laminae of the ribbon forming the discharge the highest mean effective pressure in the throat for any particular discharge will be secured.
The ribbon of liquid'which is to be taken off of the periphery of the rotating mass of water is not a solid rigid body and a part of my discovery resides in the realization that to take a thin shaving of liquid in the form of a ribbon ofi of the periphery does not require that a slot or throat like the slot or throat of a plane be disposed transversely across the width of the rotating mass in order to secure a ribbon which consists of the outermost layers across the peripheral face of the revolving mass of liquid.
 , According to my present discovery, the outermost layer of liquid which is required for making up the discharge-any discharge within the capacity of the pump-may be drawn off in an orderly manner, that is, with minimum interference between high energy and low energy liquid, by the employment of an oblong longitudinally extending slot by virtueof which liquid v 2,291,478 Fourth, the presence of the discharge port is a than the desired energy, the mean pressure in the throats will be unavoidably lowered, and the flows both longitudinally and laterally into the throat from the outermost laminae, successively, in making up the particular discharge which the pump at any particular point in its capacity may be delivering.
By the provision of a slot or throat of a conventional length and of a width substantially less than the width of the ribbon of liquid which is actively under the influence of the impeller, a blade sweeping over the port is caused to present first opportunity for outflow to the outermost particles of the ribbon which constitutes the discharge, and slightly less opportunity to the particles having less energy, so that no matter what the thickness of the discharge ribbon of liquid, the equalization which is required will be only between the particles of maximum energy, and particles no further away from the outermost or maximum radius than is necessary to make up the thickness of the discharge ribbon. Hence, the mean effective pressure will be,maximum for the particular rate of discharge.
 - The relatively narrow throat largely prevents or at least effectively limits endwise disturbance of liquid in the throat that tends to regurgitation as the vane passes over the same. This reduces or eliminates certain losses which have heretofore been unavoidable. The narrow slotlike throat which is disposed endwise of the movement of the blades in eflect allows equalization inside of the channel or casing-independently of equalization on the outside of the narrow slot or opening in the discharge throat. There is only a high velocity connection of reduced cross-section between the two whereby the function of doing work upon the liquid .within the casing, and thefunction of equalization of pressure and producing flow on the outside of the slot or in the throat without mutual interference is promoted.
' efficiency is pronounced.
Hence, the settingv up of unnecessary eddies or motions in the liquid is reduced with increase in flow pressure and efficiency.
 This construction is applicable to all the various forms of concentric pumps, both those employing a single throat or a plurality of throats, as shown in my prior Patent No. 2,123,454, or self-priming pumps with a single pair of throats or a plurality of pairs of throats, as shown in my prior Patent No. 2,110,883. The improvement produced by my invention is marked and distinctive. Primarily, the pressure curve is flatter, that is, the pressure remains higher throughout the entire range of deliveries than in any pump of the prior art known tome. Greater delivery within certain sizes as compared with prior practice of those same sizes is now possible. Increased Due to more orderly flow, higher speed of the impeller without the loss of efllciency occurring in the prior art is now possible. A smaller lighter pump and a smaller lighter engine not only of high speed but of less power will now do the work requiring a larger pump and engine of the prior art. In pumps of this type operating. as self-priming pumps the priming is not interfered with and in fact at the higher speeds is made even more eflective than it has been in like capacity of pumps of the prior art.
 According to the structure herein illustrated, and which is the preferred construction, the slotlike throat leaves on each side thereof a concentric ledge which constitutes in effect a con clearance, or substantially only mechanical clearance, do work upon the liquid to bring it to a state of maximum energy content at maximum radius. The presence of these ledges along the sides or flanks of the slots performs the dual function not only of distributing the outermost layer of maximum energy liquid along the length of the slot but allows work to be done upon liquid in the channel over these ledges so that the blade in passing from one end of the throat to the other end does not tend to lose all of the high energy liquid but depending upon the design may carry past the throat some of the high energy liquid to a succeeding throat, as in the case of a.
self-priming pump. This is possible because while high energy liquid is sliding ofi into the slotlike throating from the ledge, work is being done upon liquid further along on the ledge and this can be carried to the auxiliary ports to provide high energy liquid for discharge at the auxiliary or priming port. Hence the designer has much greater freedom of ratioing the capacities designing the shapes, sizes, spacing, etc. of the two ports relative to each other than has been possible according to known practice.
 The desideratum of high efficiency and maximum available pressure requires that the flow constituting delivery at any particular value within the capacity of the pump be made up of liquid of the highest mean value of contained energy available. In other words, as the delivery increases progressively lower energy liquid must be allowed to enter the discharge but at no point should liquid of lower energy than that necessary to make up the discharge be permitted to .make up the discharge for the reason that first the mean pressure would be needlessly lowered and second the work of equalization of pressures in the throat would be increased with loss of efficiency.
To secure the desired selective discharge of liquid according to energy content it is simpler to selectively retard the outflow of liquid of low energy content. Bearing this principle in mind, the throat or slot may be shaped variously to ofier relatively free escape selectively to liquid of high energy content by providing greater retardation to outflow of liquid of low energy content. This should function over the entire capacity range to be most efiective. In accordance with this principle the slot or throat may be tapered-in width from a greater width or opening at the front end of the port to a less width at the rear end of the port or throat. The sides may be straight or curved to meet the particular requirements of a specific service.

The pump herein illustrated was developed for the practical requirement of a fire pump for a portable fire pumper, the embodiment of the pump of the present invention in such a pumper being 'illustrated in my copending application Serial No. 293,227,,fi1ed September 2, 1939.
 According to the requirements of that particular service a compactlight weight unit of large delivery capacity, that is, large gallonage, i. c. 150 g. p. m., and capable of delivering a 'pressure of the order of IQ!) pounds per square inch is needed. Overall efficiency is of the highest desirability, since it is particularly necessary for small size and high speed. It is desirable that the pump be operated at a high speed in order to be able to employ a small size high speed motor, and thereby to hold down the size and weight and incidentally the cost for making the pumper above referred to. The pump must, furthermore,

be highly efiective on self-priming, so as to avoid all delay in priming and to be capable of taking its liquid from almost any reasonable source and holding up its pressure even though there should be air leakage into the intake.
The general features of the pump are indicated in Figures 9 and 10. The pump is of the open impeller type having the impeller I l with a shaft as hearing blades I! which run in a channel the 7 side wall of which is indicated at l3 in Figure 10,

art with the manner of constructing and operating a specific embodiment of my invention, .1 shall describe, in connection with the accompanying drawings a preferred embodiment, its mode of operation and use.
 In the drawings:

Figure l is a vertical cross section of a selfpriming pump of the type employing a single pair of throats and embodying my invention;

Figure 2 is a section taken on the line 2-2 of Figure 1 showing the throat section through the main throat of the pump shown in Figure 1;

and the cylindrical peripheral wall of which is indicated at M.
The impeller casing 13 has two adjacent substantially tangential discharge passageways comprising the main passageway i6 and the auxiliary 'or priming passageway ll, these two passageways I being divided by a dividing wall l8 between them.
The inlet to the impeller II is through the center, that is, axially, and in the present instance this axial inlet includes a trap 20 with an intake opening 24. The discharge of the pump which includes the passages IB and I1 is directed through-a separator 22 which has an outlet 23 at its top forming the actual discharge connection of the pump as a whole. The functions of the trap and separator in this construction are to constitute the pump a self-priming pump, according. to the invention disclosed and claimed in my prior Patent No. 1,578,236.
 The separator 22 during priming provides the necessary space for allowing the mixture of gas and liquid which is formed in the impeller chamout the passageway Hi to segregate into its constituents, namely, as and liquid, the gas passing off through the outlet 23 or through a bleeder port which may be disposed in the top of the separator. is permitted to return from the separator 22 through the return passageway ll peripherally Liquid which is largely freed of air,-

into the impeller H to be converted into mixture and again discharged through the passageway Ii into the separator. uation continues until the pump receives liquid,

. whereupon the pressure created upon the throat of passageway l1 stops recirculation, reverses flow and constitutes passageway ll an auxiliary discharge passageway.
The separator 22 and the pump casing l5 are joined preferably by bolting flanges 2I-2i re-" spectively, The separator has companion p'assageways i6 and i1 corresponding to the passageways i6 and I1- and forming continuations of 10. This action of air evac- Iii-order to provide the higher pressures, greater compactness and better efliciency and to permit higher impeller speeds, desired for this serviceas well as for general purposes, I have devised the novel mode of discharging the liquid which is the subject of the present invention.
It is to be observed that the invention is not limited to self-priming pumps, but is applicable to non-self-priming pumps, both of the single and plural throat type. The invention shows particular utility in multi-throat pumps, such as the self-priming pump of my Patent 2,110,883. It may also be employed in the multi-throated nonpriming pump of my prior pump Patent No. 2,134,254.
 The specific form of the impeller is not of th essence of the invention. I have found that the open impeller with substantially straight blade is the most desirable. .The straight type of blade effects priming more rapidly than does a blade of pronounced curvature. This is particularly true in pumps employing .a single outlet for 2,291,478 7 her by rotation of the impeller and discharged 1 enough to discharge the mixture and avoid over compensation. Also during liquidpumping the main passageway I6 does most of the work since it receives and removes liquid upon which maximum amount of work has been done in advance of the auxiliary or primirm throat IT. The priming throat presents the problem that it must be of suflicient capacity to return an adequate be avoided or overcome, otherwiseefliciency suf-.
fers.
 Referring now to Figiire 6 which is a diagram for explaining the energy content of liquid within the pumping channel or pumping chamber, assume that a cylindrical channel with suitable side walls-is defined by the circle a, the center of which is at 0. A vertical radius 0, 1, represents the effective radius of an impeller blade working within the channel whose inner periph ery is defined by the circle a. It may here be stated that the clearance which exists between the impeller and the side walls of the casing of the present pumpis intended to be substantially only mechanical clearance and to prevent solid particles which might be carried in the water from wedging into the gap and cutting the blade and casing. Hence, a clearance of 3 2 inch on each side is satisfactory for pumps of the present type and for the pump herein lets for mixture the relative carry of the mixture is shorter and particularly with the improvement herein disclosed. The mutliple throat selfpriming pump may employ an impeller with a pronounced curvaturer This gives the designer much greater freedom of design as it allows the development of various pressures within a given radius of blade.
 The front faces of the impellerblades are surfaces substantially normal t the plane of rotation of the impeller. That is to say, they have no functional bias to either side of the impeller cas- 'ing. Such impellers are old and well known in shown. The tip clearance on sizes like that of the impeller herein shown, which impeller is,

by way of example, 9% inches diameter by inch width, may be from a to /2 inch, and in larger sizes of pumps, it may be even as much as 4 inch or more, the purpose of the clearance being largely to avoid injury from liquid-borne solids. Even with those clearances, it is considered that the liquid at the outer periphery is entirely withinthe influenceof the impeller and moves with it.
 Referring again to Figure 6, assume a particle which may be laid 'ofi on the horizontal line 1', :c, as, for example, four units of velocity corresponding to four units of length of the radius. The straight line 0, b, represents proportion.- ately the velocity of any particle of liquid at any particular radius along the length of the blade 0, r, and this is indicated by the small letter 22 as the four units of velocity corresponding to four units of length of the' radius. Now

if we consider the energy content of the particle of liquid at the end of the radius 0, r, it will be realized that this is proportional 'to the square of the velocity, as indicated by the length of the line 12 The curve 0, c, indicates the energy the high energy particles at the very periphery and of the particles of lower energy at a shorter radius is equalized only by the high energy being expended in eddies or useless motion of equalization, the mean pressure in the throats may be more nearly that of the lower energy particles which enter the throat than thatof the higher energy particles. Eddies and parasitic motion in the liquid are to be avoided at every point. Sharp differences in energy content tend to set up such parasitic motion and eddies. Also, it can be seen that if lower energy particles are P rmitted to enter the throat from a shorter radius than is necessary to make up the full ribbon of discharge, not only is the necessity for equalization increased because of marked dif ferences in energy content, but the mean effective pressure of discharge will be reduced.
 Now it is the purpose of the present invention to take off the laminae in the order of their energy content, and to equalize them with a minimum of shock and useless motion in producing discharge outflow. Referring to Figures 1 to 4, inclusive, Figures 1, 2.and 3 show in full lines the structure of the throating of a preferred form of pump embodying my invention. The main discharge passageway 16 opens into the periphery of the channel wall i l through a relatively narrow slot or opening 25, a developed view of which is shown in Figure 3. Theport or opening 25 is the narrowest part of the con nection between the inside of the impeller casin and the separator. In other words, the port 25 forms the greatest constriction of the passageway !6. The throat I6 from the opening 25 expands smoothly and relatively gradually into the The dotted lines 21, 21 on Figure 3 merely indicate the expansion of the throat or passageway [6 in the background behind the opening itself, since Figure 3 is a view from the face of the opening, as indicated in Figure 1, on line 3-3.
 Now by way of illustrating the distinction and the importance of the invention, I shall refer to separator 22 so as to reduce the velocity of fiow smoothly and gradually to give the proper reduction in velocity in the separator whereby separation of gas from the liquid is facilitated. Figure 2 shows a longitudinal section through the passageway 16, and here it can be seen that the port or opening ,25 is the narrowest part of the communication between the impeller chamber and the separator 22 along the entire periphery of the pumping channel as defined by the concentric channel wall it, with the passageway IE, and as above stated, constitutes the most restricted part of the passageway it. The significance of this is that the port 25 is the point of maximum velocity of flow through the passageway 16, and it is the point of maximum velocity of new of liquid in the pumping channel. These two velocities being related, it then remains to coordinate them to produce and inv sure an orderly fiow. This coordination is compelled by the shape and size of the port 25, and its relation to the channel and impeller blades as herein described which insures delivery of liquid in the order of energy content thereof. It results thereby that maximum velocity delivery and consequent maximum delivery head is available at each delivery rate.
 the prior practice in pumps of this character or type. In Figure 2 I have shown in'dottedlines 18, 28 the character of the throating forming the communication between the impeller chamber and the separator to define the main throat and passagewaycorresponding to the passageway 16 of Figure 1. The plan view of Figure 4 shows an opening of the type found in the older art and viewed as though taken along the line 3-3 of Figure 1. Now whereas for a inch width impeller, as shown in Figure 2, it was previously the practice to have this throat at its narrowest portion of the order of if; inches in width, and of the same length as that shown in Figures 1 and 3. The width of the throat shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3, in full lines, is A inch, leaving thereby a ledge of 1 6 inch in width on each side; a contraction of the narrowest part of the throat of from representing the width according to the prior art and as illustrated in Figure 4, to approximately 42% according to the specific example of the invention shown in Figures 1 to 3. In other words, the area of the narrowest part of the throat, according to the specific embodiment of the present invention here shown, is of the order of 42% of the cross sectional area of the throat of the prior art. I do not mean to limit the invention to that particular ratio of reduction, since the reduction may be greater, and the improvement of my invention will appear in useful degrees even though the proportion of ledge area to active area. of the impeller is not as great as that illustrated in this specific instance. The optimum ratio of port width to blade width or channel width may vary with factors such as speed, diameter, blade width, clearance, density of liquid and certain other factors, but in general limiting or reducing the port area in amount and shape so as to produce in efiect a restriction to the outflow of low energy liquid is an improvement of great practical importance.
 The preferred form above referred to is such as to produce lateral flow into the slot-like throat and to permit work to be done upon liquid along restricted discharge for the liquid of lower energy.
Also, it will be apparent that the channel need not have a cylindrical bottom. It might be curved or V shaped.- That is not the distinctive feature. Also the ledge could at least theoretically be in the center instead of along the sides, or it could be along one side only. On larger size pumps, the throat need not be a single slot. It might be several slots side by side or staggered, with ledges along one or both sides of each slot to secure the action which is herein disclosed.
I shall now refer to Figure 5,Which shows curves indicating the difierence in performance secured by the utilization of my invention. The comparative test was made between a pump of the prior art showing the throat characteristics of Figure 4 and the same size pump with the throating of Figure 3. The pump with the known form of throating shown in Figure 4 was a size enemas in sc far as constituting the maximum constrlction between the impeller chamber and the pak" .sageway l1, and comprising a relatively narrow slot of conventional length, securing the actions R. P. M. as 21 seconds, which equals 1.9 linear j feet per second. I The dry vacuum which this pump was capable of drawing was 28 inches of mercury or 31.7 feet at an elevation above sea level of 46 feet. The curve plotting pounds pressure against delivered gallons per minute of the known form of throating is labeled old." It' shows a rapid dropofi of the pressure as the gal-.
 lonage of delivery increases to 150 gallons per minute.
A similar test was run upon anew form. of

- pump of the same size 20 Type F1. The impeller second, and the pump showed the same dry vacuum of 28 inches of mercury or 31.7 feet at an elevation-of 746 feet above sea level. Pounds pressure of delivery was plotted against discharge gallons per minute and the curve is marked fl w."

The improvement, as demonstrated in the curve, produced a higher initial discharge pressure and a higher discharge pressure throughout with a very pronounced increase in the cadisclosed in Figure 8, and partaking of the overall improvement of the pump shown in the curves of Figure 5. Y

While I am 'not able to say from direct observation, since I have not found thatpossible, just exactly what the action is which makesthe throat shown in Figures ,1, 2 and 3 operate at such a high efliciency, I' believe that the operation is as pictured in Figure 8, and I know from actual tests that the improvement exists and is very pronounced, as illustrated in the curves of Figure 5.
 By this scheme of forming the port as a longitudinal slot, the high energy layer is distributed along the entire length, rather than being dumped over the front edge, as shown in Figure 7. Likewise each succeedinglayer is strewn along the length of the slot rather than successively dumped in. Since the slot or opening 25 forms the maximum constriction the velocity is therein the highest of any part of the discharge pa'ssageway. v The result of this high velocity movement through the narrow slot is a tendency to segregate the action within the channel from theaction within the throat beyond the slot, so that equalization or re-arrangement on one. side of the slot will less affect the conditions on the other side of the slot than has been the case in structures of the prior art. Pumps embodying this form of throating and this mode of operation are quieter and more efficient than pumps of the pacity of the pump and a pronounced increase in Refer ing new to Figure 7, assume the blade I! is moving towards the conventional prior art port 29 which is shown as open across the full width of the 'channel M. It will be seen at once that the higher energy liquid at the maximum radius can immediately spill into the opening. and since the port 28 is freely open for its full length this introduction of high velocity liquid all into one end of the throat creates an immediate high velocity flow and a resulting disturbance, because of the great difference in energy content of the liquid in the throat. Some of the liquid tends to eddy and'escape back or,'force other liquid back into the pumping channel. There is nohigh energy liquid at the other end of the throat in Figure 7 to prevent the pulling in of low energy liquid by the initial high energy discharge.
 Referring now to Figure 8, a section of the channel employing my invention is indicated, the ledge 26 in this case being exaggerated so as to make clear the effect which I believe is secured by the present construction and mode of opera tion. Some of the high energy liquid from the maximum radius is immediately-spilled into the throat opening 25. But, owing to the presenceof the ledge 26, liquid at maximum'radius and with vhigh energy content, tends to be pushed along on for the passageway I! (see Fig. 1). The port 30' is preferably constructed similar to the port 25,

prior art. The improvement which this inven-'.
 tion secures is not limited to a single throat or a two-throat. pump, as I have demonstrated its usefulness in the multiple throat self-priming pump of Patent-No. 2,110,883. a

In the specific pump herein illustrated in Figures l, 2 and 3, and on which the curve marked "new on Figure 5 applies, the length of theslot is substantially identical with the length of throats of the prior art, as may be seen by comparison of Figures 3 and 4. The width, however, is very much less. In the specific pump which I have shown, the ratio of length of the slot to the width thereof is of the order of between 5 and 7 to 1, and the ratio of the impeller width to the throat width is of the order-of between 1.25 and 2 to '1. p

The pump illustrated in Figures 1 to 3'and employed in the test illustrated by the curve new of Figure 5 utilized an eight bladed open impeller 9% inches in diameter, inch wide with inch side clearance, inch top clearance, and a port length on the inner periphery of 3& inches with the edges rounded.
I do not wish to confinemy invention to these proportions or dimensions, as the specific form herein illustrated is by way of example only, and

the presence'of my invention in a pump is determined by thev law of operation and method, rather than by any specific dimension.
 Obviously, to facilitate liquid flowat high velocity, the comers of the ledges may be rounded, but the rounding of the comers does not detract from the ability to hold liquid up to the impeller to have work performed thereupon, nor does it detract from the ability of the ledges to distribute the liquid of high internal energy lengthwise of the ports instead of permitting the dumping of the same into the open throat.
I would further point out that I do not intend to limit the length of the slot to exactly the same length as that of prior art practice, but this dimension may also be varied within limits, depending upon a variety of factors such as diame ter, speed, relativewidth of the impeller blade, density of the liquid operatedupon, etc.
 A surprising feature of the present invention is that with the new throating and mode of discharging the liquid a reduction in the width but not the length of the throat has not caused a reduction in capacity, but, on the contrary, has

actually increased the capacity of, for example, a certain size of pump. In a multiple discharge self-priming pump of the type known as Type R, of the general character shown in Patent No. 2,110,883, the pump as constructed with full width main and priming throats showed a maximum working capacity of 100 gallons per minute with a head at that capacity of approximately 6'7 feet. The width of the throats at the 67 foot head was inch. I reduced the width of all the throats to inch retaining the full width of the impeller which was inch and kept the length of the slot the same as it was before. The working capacity remained at 100 gallons per minute, but the head jumped from 6'7 feet to 88 feet.
 In Figure 11 I have shown in cross section a pump casing of the type known as Type R, having two sets of throats, each set consisting of a main throat 3| and an auxiliary throat 32, communicating at their outer ends with a separator space and at their inner-ends through ports 33 and 34, respectively, with the channel in which the impeller operates. The impeller 36 is substantially of the same construction as shown in Figure 1, but it may be of either straight or curved blade, depending upon the pressure desired. The port 33, shown in developed elevation in Figure 12, is a substantially parallel-sided slot of which the front end 31 is slightly narrower than the rear end 38. The passageways 3|, 32 provide gradual expansion in cross sectional area,

and thereby reduction in velocity of liquid being discharged. The specific proportions shown in Figures 11 and 12 are of a diameter impeller operating at 3400 R. P. M., the blades of the impeller being /2 wide and having approximately clearance on the side, and the port or slot 33 being approximately wide, whereby the port occupies substantially less width than the full width of the channel and, in fact, less width than the width of the impeller blades.
 In Figure 13 I have shown a form of discharge port 33a in which the forward or leading part 31a of the port opening has been slightly enlarged to produce, in efiect, a port tapering in width from the widest portion at the front end 31a to a less width at the rear end 38. In this particular example the widest part of the port at the forward end 31a was 1%", that is, approximately the same width as the channel, and this tapered with converging sides to approximately the point 39, from which the sides were parallel and the width is Thus, for a total length of the port of about 2%", the last 1" was a parallel sided slot wide and the forward part of the slot was tapered. Obviously the taper could be extended the full length of the slot if desired.
The form of port opening shown in Figure 13 showed a marked superiority over the opening of the form shown in Figure 12, and both forms showed a great improvement over forms employed in the prior art practice. It will be observed that the slots are relatively long for so small a diameter of impeller. This impeller, however, was operated at a high speed, that is, 3400 R. P. M.- The ratio of length to mean width of the slots shown in Figures 12 and 13 is of the order of between 6 and '7 to 1.
I do not intend to be limited to the specific details shown or described, nor to the dimensions and specific proportions herein illustrated and described. except as the same are recited as essential in the appended claims.

Meredith Predicted Iowa citizens are becoming acquainted with the splendid qualifications possessed by Hon. E. T. Meredith, governor, not particularly through the medium of the Democratic press but by such representative Republican papers as the Des Moines Register-Leader which seldom has any commendation for anything or anybody on our side of the political fence. We give its cordial tribute below and invite our Republican friends to remember its meritorious words. "The Democratic party is especially fortunate in having its choice for governor acknowledged, irrespective of party, as one who would be a credit to Iowa should he be given the highest place which it is within the power of the voters to bestow. The Register cannot too strongly commend the Democratic leaders of the state on the ticket and on the platform they have presented, and will ratify at the June primaries. Mr. Meredith is one of the most aggressive champions of a bigger and better Iowa, and the men who are to be associated with him are all men of standing. To use Mr. Meredith's own expression the ticket "adds up 100 percent. Mr. Meredith has youth, energy, ambition, ability. He is genial. Everybody will like him and warm up to him. He is looking forward. He will inspire confidence. He will make a memorable campaign. The Register can hardly exaggerate his strong points as a candidate at this time. If the man the Republicans pit against him does not appeal to the best sentiment of the state, if the Republican program is not progressive and aggressive, if there is the least faltering on the great moral issues, if there is the least backward look in the platform, if there is anything to suggest that Republicanism in Iowa is not up to form, and up to the best form, there will be a successor to Horace Boies in the governor's chair, and anybody who does not recognize that fact will be in the way of a great surprise on election day. The present political upset, when the man knows what a day may bring forth, mere political designations are not going to weigh much as against the personal character and known capacity of men. Merely being Republican or Democratic will signify less in November than it has since the Civil War. In particular, it will signify less in the great administrative offices of the state. Mr. Meredith's sagacity is shown in nothing more than in the emphasis he has himself put on the platform on which he is to stand and on the men with whom he is to run. For the character of the men and the policies for which they are to stand will determine enough votes this year to turn the state one way or the other. The Register is not committing itself to Mr. Meredith's candidacy. But we are saying as strongly as we can find words to say it, that Mr. Meredith is the best man the Democrats could name, and we are putting it up to the Republican leaders as strongly as we would and words to put it up, that unless they get together on the most progressive platform they can name, on the most progressive platform they can write, they will not elect Governor Clark's successor." Methodists of the Assurance of United States were in sympathy with President Wilson's efforts to keep the United States from becoming involved in the European War was voiced by Bishop Earl Cranston, of Washington, D.C., who opened the twenty-seventh general conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Monday. It would assure the President of the United States, Bishop Cranston said, "that whatever temporary backsliding may happen when a few Methodists here or yonder may fall under the spell of a magnetic political leader, the great body of our people are in full sympathy with all of his patriotic and Christian endeavors to espouse this nation out of the European embroilment." The Times has no patience with the indiscriminate criticism heaped upon President Wilson in the national crisis through which we are now passing, by some that he has been too slow in asserting our right by others that he is pursuing a course that may lead to war with Germany. The outstanding fact remains that we are still at peace and that the President has done every thing possible to avert war. For this, he is to be commissioned and if war must come, it is time for the jingo. President Wilson's endorsement of Wilson's foreign policy, Col. Roosevelt has chosen for especial censure the fact that the government at Washington did not protest against the German invasion of Belgium, and harsh and bitter adjectives have leaped from the Colonel's tongue in his attempt to pillory the administration for its course in that matter," says the Buffalo Times. "It is well to compare Col. Roosevelt's rebukes on this point with his opinions at the time the Belgian question first arose, and it will be..." Found that at that time the Colonel expressed himself in a totally different vein, from that since associated with his utterances on the point. "In a single article in the Outlook for September 22, 1914, Col. Roosevelt said: "A deputation of Belgians has arrived in this country to invoke our assistance in the time of their dreadful need. What action our government can or will take, I know not. It has been announced that no action can be taken that will interfere with our entire neutrality. It is certainly eminently desirable that we should remain entirely neutral, and nothing but urgent need would warrant breaking our neutrality and taking sides one way or the other. "Of course it would be folly to jump into the gulf ourselves to no good purpose and very probably nothing that we could have done would have helped Belgium. We have not the smallest responsibility for what has befallen her, and I am sure the sympathy of this country for the suffering of men, women, and children of Belgium is very real. Nevertheless, this sympathy is compatible with full acknowledgment of the unwisdom of his uttering a single word of official protest unless we are prepared to make that protest effective and only the clearest and most urgent national duty would ever justify us in deviating from our rule of neutrality and non-interference. "Thereby Col. Roosevelt gave a complete endorsement to the policy of President Wilson which Roosevelt afterward so savagely and unjustly censured. Such a flat contradiction tells its own story and it puts on Roosevelt a debt of explanation which he can never discharge." Proposed Resolution of Necessity. Be it resolved, By the City Council of the City of Cresco, Iowa, that it is deemed advisable and necessary to make improvements by paving with 7 inch Portland cement concrete pavement, consisting of a 5 inch foundation and a 2 inch top course, the foundation to be prepared and the pavement to be constructed in accordance with the specifications to be prepared by the City Engineer and approved by the City Council, the following named streets and parts of streets to be laid: Third Avenue East from the West line of Sixth Street East to the West line of Eighth Street East.

Pless) Due to the large increase of automobiles, the necessity of good roads becomes more and more urgent. I do not propose macadamize or paved roads at all, but simply confine myself to the ordinary dirt and gravel roads. Having run an automobile the past summer, I have discovered, more than ever, the poor condition of our country roads also the Useful expenditure of the people's money. My first example will be the turnpike, built a little over two miles west of Cresco. The men and teams were continuously busy, scraping down the small hills and knolls and filling up little valleys and depressions, for nearly a whole summer and unnecessarily moved as much ground on a half or three quarter mile stretch as would have sufficed to fill every hole, culvert and bridge approach, from Cresco to Riceville and thus would have given us, approximately, twenty-two miles of fairly good road, instead of a half or three quarters of a mile. This may seem exaggerated to some, but I think that anyone, who has done very much traveling by auto, will agree with me, that the roads will be good for a quarter or half a mile and then will come a few bumps and holes, and then some more good road and so on ad infinitum. Consequently, if those bad spots were given attention and perfectly cured, the roads would be good, all through. I would urge that ten teams and twenty men or any desirable number be sent in every direction, following up the road, to fill up every chuck hole, every water hole and every deep rut, and, if they keep this up throughout the season, there will be more passable roads on account of the diminishing number of these and of soft spots, these same men might also be charged, with the dragging of the roads, after every rain. In the next place, special attention should be paid to culverts and bridges. Anyone, traveling from Old Town, Lime Springs, to Chester, must be astonished at the splendid culverts, constructed along that road and the condition in which they are left. So far, the road would have been better without them, because, before they were put in, there was one bad hole, and now, with a culvert in, there are two: one on this side and one on the other, causing a jar while crossing them. For two consecutive years, these culverts have been left this way, without properly filled approaches. I would suggest that the dirt for filling be not simply dumped into the hole, but rounded and carefully leveled off, so that the water will have to run away. I have observed places where the dirt was dumped in without leveling and if a person unexpectedly runs against one of these bumps, he is liable to be thrown from the car. I realize that this cannot all be done at once, but I believe, if my plan were followed, it would give us tolerable good roads and greater mileage, at no greater expense, than the system followed heretofore, if system, it may be called. Whenever there are naturally wet and springy spots or where water is standing in the ditches, I would make more extensive use of tile draining. The efficiency of the road to cure spring spots, is proven to all who compare the road between Howard Center Bridge and Long's Farmstead, as it was, before the county put in a string of tile on each side of the road, with what it is now. Every spring, boards or posts had to be stuck into the mire as danger signals, but now that place is as solid, as any between Cresco and Howard Center. What wrought the improvement? Tile did it. It is the water that spoils a dirt road and, if you can keep that out, you have a fair road. It goes without saying, that any road officer, having in his district a bridge or culvert, protruding three inches above the road bed, must be a person of a depraved mind, otherwise he would not subject his fellow citizens to so much ruffling of temper and their cars and tires to so many severe jolts. The bridge or culvert, in the condition just described, is the unpardonable sin in road construction. So much for working the roads to greater advantage: now I want to say a few words about how the money expended for the upkeep of the roads, can do more work than it actually is accomplishing. It is the common complaint, that the expense of surveying and superintending of the work is considerably out of proportion with the sums spent in actual construction. The tendency is, to have too many superintendents, drawing large wages and big mileage without accomplishing results. This tendency may be illustrated by a fact, which was actually observed in a neighboring county. Passers by noticed a man with a team filling up a hole and besides that, two autos and two other men there. On inquiry, it was found out that the two cars belonged to two different road officers, both of whom superintended the work the lone man was doing, drawing, each one, a larger day's wage than the man actually working, besides their mileage. It is self-evident, that in this idle the money was sunk that would have filled four other holes of the same dimensions. Let us, by all means, try to cut down overhead cost, to get more money to put into actual road construction. Another cause of wasting money, is the system, largely followed, of hiring work done by the day, where one frequently assists the other in doing nothing. It is my idea that all road work should be let by contract to the lowest responsible bidder and the same be held to follow the exact specifications. Such a contractor would see to it, that the men and horses would do a full day's work, which again would redound to the benefit of our roads and at the same time stop the sinful waste of material, for which the county paid. Four or five miles from Cresco, a cement bridge was built, costing, maybe, six hundred dollars and when the work was finished there were left five hundred empty cement sacks, to rot in the rains, besides the lumber used in constructing the bridge which floated down the river, a clear waste of sixty dollars or ten percent of the entire cost of the structure. Those sixty dollars might have remedied two of the worst places in the roads of Howard county. If such a waste is not sinful then please tell me what sinful means. We read so much nowadays, in the papers, of German efficiency in Europe can't we have a little more American efficiency and less waste in the department of public highways here in Howard county?

Charles L. Dering. Maine The result in the election in Maine today will be awaited with unusual interest, though interest attaches to Maine elections in all presidential elections years. "As Maine goes, the country," is an old saying. That, of course, is not true but still Maine is supposed to afford an indication of the national result. We believe that the result in Maine is of value only for its moral effect upon the country rather than as an indication of the trend of the country's political opinion. Since 1856 Maine has been a pretty reliable republican state at presidential elections, though there has perhaps been no state more frequently and violently disturbed by local issues. As far back as 1878 it elected Garcelon, democrat, on the greenback issue. Two years later it elected a republican governor, but in 1882 the greenback issue became acute again and another democrat was elected. The next democrat was elected in 1910 and at the same time a democratic legislature was chosen. In 1912 the republicans elected a governor. Two months later Wilson carried the state, though his vote was less than the combined vote of Roosevelt and Taft by about 22,000. Those are almost exactly the same figures by which Taft had defeated Bryan four years earlier. The vote of Wilson in 1912, by the way, was less than that of the defeated democratic candidate for governor, by more than 16,000. Haines, the successful republican candidate, received more than 70,000, about 4,000 less than the combined Roosevelt and Taft vote. Democrats and republicans agree that the normal republican majority in Maine is about 15,000. But that is the majority which republicans usually cast at presidential elections. For several years the state has been so disturbed by the prohibition question and other local matters that cross currents have frequently reduced or increased these figures. But Maine republicans seldom take their quarrels to the presidential election. This year there is little local disturbance so that as the election will go today, it may be expected to go by practically the same figures on November 7. Cave Creek Floods For at least fifteen years, spasmodic and sporadic attempts have been made to control the erratic waters of Cave creek, which is generally a typical Arizona river but which now and then becomes a costly torrent. How often its floods have swept between this and the rich country northwest and inundated the western part of the city, we do not know, but there have been at least three such visitations within the last fifteen years. It was proposed after the first great flood, to control the Cave creek waters by means of a dyke constructed from high ground beyond the flood limits on the east to a point far enough west to throw the waters into New river where they properly belong and where they go unless the flood from the mountains is of such volume that the ill-defined channel cannot carry the water away. Then the flood sweeps to the southeast, tears out the banks of the Arizona canal, thus receiving reinforcement, and continues its devastating course across the country. We do not recall the amount of the estimated cost of the proposed dyke. But we know it was not appalling, much less than the probable damage inflicted by every visitation. It is, perhaps, unfortunate in the long run that these Cave Creek floods are so infrequent. If they occurred under something would be done about them. We think, though, that something will be done in consequence of this one, for since the last one, the country has been much more densely settled and the damage has been greater. If the farmers northwest of the city and the residents of the town and suburbs west of the capitol will now rise up, we think they can secure action. There may not be another Cave Creek flood for another fifteen years. And, again, there may be another next month. Great Britain's Unaltered Course The "retaliatory provisions" of the revenue bill were sprung upon the world rather suddenly, as suddenly upon this country as upon Great Britain. Yet they seem to have created less stir abroad than at home. In fact, they have created no stir at all in Great Britain. They have provoked there nothing but a cool indifference. It is significant that David Lloyd George, since the passage of the bill, declared in a speech in parliament that the censorship of our mails would be maintained and he coolly admitted that the censorship was maintained for the purpose of ascertaining the contents of American business correspondence, for the use that could be made of it to extend British interests rather than for the prevention of acts of unneutrality. We had long suspected that, but did not expect an admission of it. Coupled with our indignation, we entertain a sort of admiration for the munition minister's frankness. On Saturday, Lord Robert Cecil, minister of trade, said, "It is not likely that Great Britain will change her black list policy at the request of the United States." We are not among those who expected Great Britain would be influenced in the slightest degree by this retaliatory legislation which Congress has left optional with the administration to enforce. The quiet disregard by Great Britain of presidential protests for the last year and a half was a pretty accurate indication that that country would not be moved by legislation which only suggested but did not direct. Great Britain has yielded nothing to the administration since the controversy began. On the contrary, her practices were made the more rigid, we sometimes thought, as an answer to our puny protests. Americans now have fewer rights on the sea than they have had at any time since the first American note of protest was sent to Great Britain. We cannot forbear a sort of admiration for the steady encroachments of Great Britain against American rights, when we compare that unjust though consistent course with the shilly shallying, wordy policy of the United States. It may be safely predicted now that that retaliatory legislation will prove absolutely worthless; that it will serve nothing except as a basis for attempted negotiations on the part of our administration which will sink it deeper into the world's contempt than ever. Great Britain has not always been so indifferent to American words and will not always be so. In a matter that far less concerned American rights, that, in fact, did not at all concern the rights of any American citizen, President Cleveland once sent a brief word to Great Britain that was instantly heeded and a project for extending her territory over a part of Venezuela was abandoned. It is not now the spirit of the American people that Great Britain so insolently disregards. It is the American administration which has ceased to be animated by the spirit of the people. TEMPERANCE TALK Our Military "Policy" Orders regarding the national guard are being issued and countermanded with such regularity that the layman has some cause for bewilderment. The latest news is that 15,000 of the guardsmen will be brought back to their mobilization camps preparatory to being mustered out of the federal service. But this order contradicts the statement of Secretary of War Baker a few days ago that the men of the national guard on the border would be kept there "until they could be withdrawn without endangering American lives and property." He made a statement in reply to complaints that the guardsmen were being held in the service of the government after the emergency for which they were called out had passed, that they were "winning bloodless victories daily." He declared that American residents along the international border were enjoying a peace and security that they could not know without the military forces to protect them. The reason that Secretary Baker does not know his own mind probably is that he has to take orders from the president. The result is that while he may settle on a particular policy one day, the president is very likely to reverse it the next day. The idea of retaining the militia on the border until peace and security are restored in Mexico is absurd for it may be years before that country secures a stable government. "Authorizations" for increasing the size of the army do not mean very much under democratic auspices. There have been only 033 enlistments in the regular army within the last five months while deaths, discharges, and desertions have occurred amounting to five times that number. That is, the army is growing smaller instead of larger. It is one thing to "authorize" a thing and another to do it. Too much of the democratic legislation consists of "authorization." OWEN JOHNSON IN FRANCE Among the passengers who arrived at Bordeaux on the steamship Kochambeau, from New York, was Owen Johnson, the American author and member of the committee for the re-education of disabled soldiers. Mr. Johnson, who always has shown his friendship and devotion toward France and its cause, is making every effort to realize a rapprochement between France and the United States. "You may be assured," he said, "that we are very near to the realization of our project, and that all Americans are convinced of its utility and even its necessity. The pro-Germans themselves are now compelled to admit the superiority of the great French nation and they have settled down to the idea that France, with its allies, is bound to win this war." Before leaving New York, Mr. Johnson had long conversations with Theodore Roosevelt, Myron T. Herrick, former ambassador to France, and Judge Hughes. The subject of these conversations was military preparedness in the United States, and it was agreed that compulsory service has now become indispensable for the security of the country. But Prussian militarism will not be imitated. Mr. Johnson said. The superiority of the French organization has been recognized, he added, and the object of his visit is to study minutely the whole machinery of the French army. From the European Edition of the New York Herald. BACK TO TWO-COURSE DINNER FROM A JAPANESE PHILOSOPHER One of the strongest attacks made upon the demon booze in Phoenix in many a day, was made last night, when Dr. Ray Clarkson Harker, of the First Methodist church, delivered a prohibition sermon, that for brilliance and fire, has seldom been equalled. Herbert E. Nixon was in charge of the music. The large audience was deeply moved by Dr. Harker's remarks. The sermon was in the nature of an expose of the liquor traffic, and the benefits which have accrued since the advent of prohibition in Arizona. The Sermon in part is as follows: There are three reasons why we do not want the saloon back. The Effect of Prohibition on business. On the first Saturday night, after the saloons were banished from Arizona, all the hukeries of Phoenix ran out of bread and cake, and four of our meat markets ran out of meat. Drunkards' children were getting more bread and cake and meat. I examined the records at the city hall several times after prohibition began in and found that while the saloon was here it was costing Phoenix from $350 to $400 per month to take care of our prisoners. After the saloons were gone, that cost decreased to from $30 to $50 per month. The city of Phoenix saved $20,000 the first six months. This was brought about by the decrease in the expense of the city jail, by the reduction of the police force from 23 to 17, and by the decrease in this cost of prosecutions in the courts. In ten days after the saloons went out, the chain gangs disappeared from our streets and the man who had charge of the chain gang was out of a job. One of the superintendents of the mine at Ray was in Phoenix some months ago. I asked him concerning the effect of the abolition fifth week on accidents and the mine. I told him I wanted a careful answer for I desired to quote him. In the meantime, he answered that they had kept account of that very thing and that it had reduced accidents in their mine 10 percent. The Copper Queen, the largest institution in our state employing labor, says that there is 31 percent saving in efficiency among our men since the union was driven out. Before prohibition came, 80 percent of our men reported for work 2 or 3 days after payday. Since prohibition was percent report and all in better condition. A mother of nine children in his home in paying for fifty dollars' worth of groceries said: "This is the first time since we were married that the children have had the clothes they need and our bills were all paid." The second reason why we did not want the saloons back is the fact that the first of the year, 100 men were on strike at Miami, 500 at Ray and 500 at Clifton and Morey, no percent of these men were foreigners and 60 percent Mexican. The fact that there were no murders speaks well for the men and it speaks worlds for prohibition. On January 1, 1915, the first day the saloons were closed. I visited the Phoenix city jail. There were five in all, among the prisoners were six women. I looked over the record book and found there had been from 40 to 50 people in jail for months. On January 6, 1915, I visited the jail again and found that there were 14 in jail. On February 16, I visited the jail again and there were six in jail. No. Women we-p the. During the last year of the session, we had 15 arrests as a daily venue. I found some days in the early months of 1915 when there were no arrests. The total arrests for 1914 in Phoenix for all offenses, were 4,541. Total arrests for 1915 were 10,634. Total arrests for drunkenness, in 1914, were 6,634. Total arrests for drunkenness for 1915 were 224. I heard Dean Hodg, who had just come from the penitentiary, say that the inmates at our state prison had been reduced 50 percent. We had 3 murders in our state in the last months that we had the "loon." We had six murders in the first year and a half after the saloon was finished. In Pinal county there were 17 murders the last 6 months of the existence of the saloon there. There was no murder in that county in the first year. The Parisian hostess now warns her guests as soon as the soup is on the table, "We have only a simple little meal, you know; Just a couple of dishes, that's all. We have only the cook and the housemaid left. The butler is at the front, and very fine letters he writes us, too." There is talk in Paris of finding the "Two-Course Dinner club," that that after the war there will be healthful simplicity and no return to the extravagances of the past. Two courses! That was the ordinary dinner in the New England of the '80s; meat with vegetables, then pie or pies. The vegetables were put on the table with the meat or fish and the mistress of the house spooned them for the guest. Father carved. The guest knew exactly what the layout was, the pie was on a side table and he regulated his appetite accordingly. He could not say, "If I had known what was coming I should not have eaten so much of his or that." Good old days: An Englishman insists that blackberries and apples should be united in use. "Blackberry and apple pie is ever so much nicer than blackberry pie, and the same is true of jam. I remember that in the west country a most delicate pie used to be made of blackberries and a particular kind of raspberry. The apples were merely cut in two, without peeling." From the Boston Herald. Japanese are always happy; at least seem to be happy, because they rarely understand what love means. One of the Japanese charms is in the fact that nothing in Japan, from the matter of clothes to the matter of food, is ever enough. There is in our Japanese life no period called youth; we arrive at manhood at once from boyhood, and those boyhood days are frightfully short. Yone Noguchi in the International. The state tax commission for my guide and find his record excellent. Within a few days of his appointment on the commission and while its chairman, an order was issued that all property for that year must be assessed at 60 percent of its value. There were no long hearings, no delays from week to week, as is done by our corporation commission. The order was issued and the mines, railroads and everyone else paid. In the second report of the tax commission to the governor, Miller recommended a mine tax law, but it is absolutely nothing like the mine tax law introduced by the mining companies. I give herewith Millers recommendations to the governor regarding a mine tax law. These paragraphs are found on pages 70 and 71 of the second report of the state tax commission: "That a specific mine tax law be enacted similar to the one passed by the last legislature, except that the net proceeds alone be made the basic factor and increasing the multiple from to whatever figure the legislature may think proper. I transmit herewith copy of mine tax law based on the net proceeds of the mine and recommend its passage by the legislature, believing it will promote equity of taxation between the mines and yield more revenue to the state from the producing mines than any other measure yet proposed." These paragraphs do not read as if they came from a corporation hireling. Mr. Betts and the other four gentlemen to the contrary notwithstanding. I do not believe that the four gentlemen who signed that amendments ever saw Miller's recommendations to the governor. But what difference does it make to the farmer where any candidate stands with regard to the mine tax law? No mine tax law was enacted. The Republicans of Maricopa Co.

The first year with the saloon we had so many arrests, that we had to hire additional tail room to take care of our prisoners. On Labor Day, 1914, without the saloon, we had to hire additional tail room to take care of our prisoners. On Labor Day, 1915, without the saloon, and with a similar charge, held at the same park and under the same auspices and there were no arrests. The third reason why we do not want the saloon back is because of the effect of Prohibition on the morals of the people. A confirmed drunkard of Phoenix and six months after the abolition of the saloon, "I have been a whiskey soak for 20 years, but thank God I am now a free man." Among the signs the liquor forces of California have erected is this one: Prohibition will paralyze California." We have had prohibition in Arizona for almost two years. What has prohibition paralyzed here? Has it paralyzed our sunshine, or our mountains, or our alfalfa fields, or cotton fields, or schools, or our homes, or our churches? I'll tell you what it has paralyzed. Before the decision on personal use, it was paralyzing our chain gang, our police courts, our Keeley Institutes, our jails, our state penitentiary. It was paralyzing the tears of drunkards, children, and the heartaches of drunkards. Wives and the tears of anxious mothers. In 1912 Colorado went wet by 43,000. In 1914, 70,000 more earnest people went to the polls and Colorado went cry. In the last temperance election in California, 840,000 registered voters never went to the polls and the crime of rum-soaked California is at the door of those 340,000 recreant citizens. Don't fall to vote in November and let the paralyzing work of prohibition go on. OF BRUNSWICK COMPANY C. McCormick, of Los Angeles, agent of the Brunswick Drug company, is stopping at the Adams hotel while here for a few days on business. Where the People May Have Hearing Statement by Mr. Haggard To the Editor of The Republican: Sir, I note in today's Republican an advertisement regarding the mine tax record of P. J. Miller. I have heretofore made an investigation of Miller's record while tax commissioner. This investigation was not made on the street corner, but I took the first and second reports of The Care of the Child A Word to Parents and Teachers: Now, when we are about to open our schools again for another nine months of training for the children, it seems an appropriate time to say a few words of warning and counsel regarding a subject which to me is the most important for the children's future welfare and success in life, namely, their health. It is a great handicap for any child, say of 16 to begin life without a fair education but it is a still greater handicap to begin life with impaired health, for one can be acquired all through life by close application, but a youth who starts life in poor health does indeed. Face a dark future. It seems to me it ought to be a sacred duty of every parent and teacher to do everything possible not only to conserve the health of the child but to aid the weak ones in attaining a good, sound, healthy body. The public is liberal with money towards the equipment and upkeep of the schools and it has a right to expect mental and physical efficiency of the child in return, for either mental or physical deficiency is an economic loss to the public. For a number of years I have treated children for various ailments and have observed that nearly all defects like curvature of the spine, round shoulders, flat chests, etc., occur between the ages of 9 to 14 years of age, for the prevalence of those defects among our people, asking your family physician or anyone who has to examine a great number of people like a recruiting officer or insurance examiner, although later in life it may have developed into some disease more painful than the original cause. You, yourself, may be convinced by observing your children or your friends and you will be surprised how many of them have defects of the spine, shoulders, lips, chest, and ribs. In seeking a cause for the prevalence of those defects at the age of 9 to 14, I have come to a positive conclusion that most of them are caused by improper positions at home and in school. At that age the child's bones are more pliant than later in lite or strong while the muscles arp not fully devel oped or strong enough to hold the frame in its normal position. If the child's body is held in the same un natural position day after day while it is growing it will eventually become permanent only as it grows, the defect becomes more prominent. For a child wno already has acquired a defect only expert treatment can cor rect it. Our school desks and the system of seating the children are the cause of most of the physical defects mentioned. Most school desks are bought because the agent is a good talker, they look good or are cheap. The average school hoard does not study what desk is the best for the child, because most of them have no special training in that line. A straight, scientific desk ought to be adjustible so it could be raised or lowered or pulled close to the chest or farther away according to the size of the child. 1 do not know where such a desk is to be had, but undoubtedly any of the school furni ture manufacturers would be glad to make them. However, that is for the future, so it Is up to the teachers to do the best possible with present equipment. Here are a few facts that might be of some aid: If a desk is too high, the child is forced to put one arm down while the other guides the pen, pencil, or book on top of the desk. The result is one shoulder higher than the other and great danger of forming a lateral curvature of the spine. If the forces the child to a stooping position and flat chest. If the desk is too close, it forces the child's shoulders too far back with too much strain on the lower part of the back, often causing what is commonly called sway-back. The best position for a student is 4. Two children of exactly the same height, both feet on the floor, both feet standing, do not always hold the same height of desk, as one chest about three inches from edge of the desk. The chest about three inches from the edge of the desk is very much heavier through the desk and the back of the desk to fit the arms and shoulders than the other. Never allow the child to sit up straight, give him a few minutes outdoors. Delegate the teacher who, by training and inclination, is best fitted for the position, to superintend the seating of the children, for it is quite a science to seat them properly. Bear in mind the following points when seating children: 1. Children of the same age are not the same in size. 2. That a girl and a boy of the same physical exercise for the children, but space forbids it at this time. In conclusion, I wish to urge you to take more interest in your children. We have the church, the home, and the schools to look after their spiritual, moral, and intellectual training, let us not neglect the physical, for a bright soul will shine more brightly if the body is well and beautiful.

Four to six bottles have cured the worst cases of dropsy. One to three bottles have cured the worst case of piles; a relief is always experienced. What it is a mercy to get relief in such an excruciating disease. Since its first discovery, I have from time to time added various other herbs to it; of one of the most, Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, says; “It is an herb of Jupiter, and in the sign Leo. It opens obstructions of the liver, gall, and spleen; it is an especial friend to the liver, worth all other herbs put together; cooling it when too hot, and warming it when too cold. It creates an appetite, curbs all gone and sinking feeling in the pit of the stomach, causes all pains, and stitches in the side. It cures the Jaundice by opening the gall, and restores the native color of the body. It expells all raw, viscera, and slimy humors out of the body; it cleanses all inward ulcers and congested blood from the kidneys. By opening obstructions of the spleen, it purges all burnt choler and melancholy vapors which riseth to the head and brain, causing distressing headache, fearful foreboding of trouble, trembling of the heart, fainting and swelling. The herb boiled in wine is particularly good to revive the drooping spirit of the aged, and whoever has a lingering sickness after a fever, imthing restores him to health so quick as drinking the juice of this herb. “The seeds boiled in cure the most offensive breath, and, drunk at beau, prevents what is commonly called nightmare, and lumbarism, a disease of the heart.” The Father of Medicine says of another herb in this composition, that “it is in herb of the Sun, and in the sign Leo.” The sun is the source of the root, which the heart; and this herb is the best cordial, the greatest strengthener of the heart, of any that grows; it comforteth the heart, cureth all palpitation to the heart, take away trembling, aiming and smothering of the root, yet it must be taken carefully, or severe griping will ensue, which must be corrected with fennel seed or ginger. So much for this herb between which and the adder there is the utmost affinity so much so that the adder will not touch him that is the herb about him.” No change of diet ever necessary—eat the best you can get, and enough of it. Directions for Use. Adults, one table-spoonful per day; children over ten years, dessert-spoonful; children from five to eight years, teaspoonful.

Worcester, March 15, 1859. GEO. SESSIONS. "For the last six months, I have had a good opportunity to observe the effects of different preparations for the hair, and to obtain the opinion of individuals using them; and from information thus obtained, I am satisfied that your 'Mint Specific' is the best remedy extant, for the growth and preservation of the hair." Boston, May 26, 1859. CHAS. H. BLANCHARD. "For a year my wife's hair had been falling off, and she was troubled with a severe eruption on her head, so that she was quite bald. Last month she commenced using your Mint Specific and with the use of one bottle her head is covered with hair, and it is soft, glossy, and natural. The eruption has entirely disappeared, and she has promise of a fine growth of healthy hair." Worcester, April 25, 1848. "Upon receiving a bottle of your Mint Specific, it looked so pure and nice I was induced to try it. I have used only part of a bottle, and find my hair not only assuming its former soft texture, but a luxuriance of growth with it had fallen off. Mrs. E. A. Babbit Worcester, April 25, 1848.

Article: Then there is a by no means insignificant body who will vote for the Bill with the hope that, through the means of a Reformed Parliament, they will succeed in carrying some darling hobby of their own into effect. “ Had we a reformed Parliament,” exclaims Lord Winchelsea, “ the detestable Popish Relief Bill would not have passed into a law ; in a reformed Parliament, therefore, there is a good chance of its being repealed, and for a reformed Parliament will I vote.” In the same spirit Earl Stanhope will vote for the Bill, because he persuades himself that, in a reformed Parliament, all damnable free-trade heresies would be scouted ; and the reputation of the late Mr. Huskisson and the political economists be at a discount. The evangelical party will also vote for the Bill, as a means of revolutionizing the bench of Bishops, and indeed the Church at large — that is of confining the Lords Spiritual to their clerical duties, (if they have any,) and of making the idle non-resident pluralist contribute a little of his superfluity to the support of the working clergymen, with whom, at present, it is short commons and primitive Christianity, in the regard of stipend. These, altogether, will make about sixty votes, to be added to one hundred and twenty, who will vote from mere motives of self-interest, which, again added to the bona-fide friends of the Bill, will, we take it, ensure a considerable majority. Of the Right Reverend bench we at present will not say more than that it is the sincerest wish of the bitterest foes of the Church of England that the Bishops may vote in a body against the Bill. m ( 520 ) SKETCHES OF THE SCOTTISH BAR, NO. II. Mr . Cockburn , Solicitor- General, It is not as a lawyer that this gentleman is distinguished. His constitutional indolence— -he was never known to be guilty of making an exertion which he could avoid— 4ias prevented him from becoming learned in his profession : and his mind is deficient in that subtlety, that power of seeing and following up the finest and most minute distinctions, which is the principal requisite in a successful jurist. Neither is he distinguished as an author. The few articles which he has contributed to the Edinburgh Review, although uniformly ap¬ posite and useful, have never attracted much notice after the purpose they were intended to serve had been achieved, nor are they con¬ nected in the public mind with his name. And yet there is scarcely a more marked and prominent individual at the Scottish bar. Mr. Cockburn’s family have for generations back been Tories and placemen. He himself started in life as the friend of Jeffrey, the participator of his opinions and principles, and he has remained true to his faith. We do not lay so much stress upon the mere virtue of consistency as many people do ; we think more honourably of human nature than to fancy it so rare and unattainable. Men are vacillating only in those matters to which they have paid little attention, or which are indifferent to them. When they attach themselves de¬ cidedly and with foreknowledge to a political party, more especially when their choice is determined by principle, so far from finding it a hard task to adhere to it with fidelity, the difficulty is to change. Pride and self-will dictate consistency, and these passions can only be turned aside in their course by the very strongest motives. But in Cockburn’s case there were peculiar difficulties to encounter. He is, to a proverb, the slave of that constitutional indolence to which we have already alluded — a kind of lazy bonhommie , or moral and in¬ tellectual Epicureanism- — which, while it has kept him comparatively a poor man, offers, on account of that callousness to the censure of others with which it arms its victim, a less efficacious defence against the temptations of ease and affluence, than men of more restless and rigid tempers are furnished with. That Cockburn should, with all the temptations to which his connexions and disposition exposed him, have preserved his faith unsullied, is no ordinary proof of a pure and well-principled mind. For one man who has deserted the good cause from evil or ambitious motives, there have been twenty seduced by indolence. Nevertheless we are inclined to suspect that our hero does not occupy that high place in the public estimation to which this rare virtue entitles him. The cause of this will be best explained by entering into a more detailed account of his characteristic peculi¬ arities, a mode of proceeding which promises at once to afford amuse¬ ment by presenting us with an original and interestingly constituted mind, and to do justice to a worthy man not generally understood. Cockburn’s mind is of that order which grasps the outline o^ a series of events rather than recognises the details. It is compre¬ hensive, not accurate. Individual facts leave slight impressions upon 521 Mr. Cockburn , Solicitor-General. it, but their united tendency is broadly marked. Our meaning may be thus illustrated. In searching into a case of evidence, some minds take all the facts separately, examine by what testimony each is supported, reject such as are insufficiently vouched for, and then, painfully and laboriously dovetailing the remainder into each other, form their conclusions. Cockburn listens to the evidence as it is delivered, allows his view of the facts to form itself as the story is developed piece-meal, and instead of going through the process we have detailed, jumps at once at his conclusion. He is thus less certain of drawing correct inferences, but his opinions are always plausible and self-consistent. They are the children of imagination, of the constructive faculty of the mind, not of ratiocination. They rest on a less secure basis than the results of sincere investigation, but they have a more palpable and tangible form, and take a firmer hold of the mind. There is probably some necessary connexion between this feature of his intellectual character, and the want of imagery, and of the play of wit, which we find in all his speeches and writings. There is emphasis, correctness, and beauty in all his discourses. His polished periods roll along, and the train of his argument advances equally. We experience high enjoyment and are carried along by him, but when we stop to reflect, we find no image or picture, beau¬ tiful or striking in itself, apart from all consideration of its appositeness, remaining in our memory. It was the sentiment alone which imbued his thoughts and breathed from out them, that subdued us to his will ; but this sentiment unallied to fancy is vague and formless. In like manner we find in none of his speeches playful sallies of wit, striking antithesis, or any of those coruscations which sparkle in every sentence of Jeffrey. Nothing breaks the smooth and oily current of Cockburn’s thought. He provokes our laughter indeed, but it is by strokes of rich sly humour, not by wit. When we attribute indolence to Cockburn, we do not mean any¬ thing like phlegma or dull stupid indifference. Perhaps there never existed a man with a finer flow of vivacious spirits. He is one of those happily constituted beings to whom merely to live, to breathe, is a strong delight. He is sensitively alive to all the beauties of external -nature. He takes pleasure in social intercourse. His jokes are unceasing, and the exuberance of his enjoyment not unfrequently finds vent in gambols and practical jokes. The same unctuous sen¬ timent which gives to his orations their alternating richness of pathos and humour, is diffused through his whole frame, and oozes out in all his actions. In thought and enjoyment, his vitality is intense ; but he is indolent in that he is incapable of application. He cannot task his uncurbed spirit to any labour in which he delights not, for the purpose of attaining any object, however desirable. He is over¬ informed with life, and the intense consciousness of the present deadens the anticipations of the future, and indisposes him to any exertions which have a prospective aim. The consequences of such an original constitution of mind are strikingly evinced in his public and his professional character. In re¬ gard to the first, it may not be unnecessary to premise, that there has ever been a marked difference between the English Whigs and the 522 Sketches of the Scottish Bar. school of politicians in Edinburgh to which the same title has been given. The former are essentially practical politicians ; the latter, with scarcely one exception, theoretical. The peculiar political con¬ stitution of Scotland has been the cause of this. The management of local, as well as of national public business, has hitherto been vested, in that country, exclusively in the hands of a few individuals. The consequence has been the same as has uniformly ensued in all countries where such an arrangement has obtained. The men of busi¬ ness have learned to regard their official situations rather as sources of emolument than as onerous and responsible employments. The great mass have learned to look on in silent apathy ; and the few whose more active and inquiring spirits prompt them to remonstrate against misrule, having no opportunity afforded them of acquiring a practical knowledge of the management of public business, have uni¬ formly been deficient in the ready tact and strong grasp which can only be learned in such a school. Some, with more perseverance and less softness of disposition than Cockburn, have been enabled to supply, in a measure, this deficiency; but his politics remain, to a great degree, those of a recluse. He is apt to disregard specific questions, and enforces pertinaciously broad and general principles, which are openly denied by few, and which, even when conceded, leave still a wide field of debatable ground. Laying too little stress upon individual measures, in which he himself takes no interest, and averse to exertion, he is ever ready to recommend and strike up a compromise with the opposite party. But the mass of the people cannot appreciate general principles, which, in their estimation, are mere words — a cheap and easy substitute for active exertion ; while, on the other hand, they feel the pressure of one wrong measure, above the influence of which Cockburn is placed by the sphere in which he moves. They doubt the sincerity of a man, who, making such large professions, shows so little active sympathy with them. And, in truth, though they wrong his motives by their suspicions, they are not much at fault in their appreciation of the practical re¬ sults. The deleterious tendency of his disposition is yet more markedly shown in his professional character. His really powerful talents, combined with his ready, pleasing, yet commanding elocution, entitled him to the highest success at the bar. He has, it is true, and we have already said as much, little of that precision and subtlety, which, more than any other qualites, facilitate the acquisition of legal know¬ ledge ; but a strong mind can always compensate these subordinate deficiencies, if it be but endowed with perseverance. This, however, was not his case. He felt tempted to supply anxious study of the bearings of his case, and the subtle distinctions of the law, which ap¬ plied to it, by eloquently enforcing such views as his fertile imagina¬ tion suggested to him. He entered upon a new case with all the ani¬ mation of his nature, but he tired of it long before it could be carried through all the tedious and winding steps prescribed by the court, and laboured assiduously to persuade his clients to compromise, after a long course of litigation, cases, the prosecution of which he had, at first, most vehemently recommended. Such a line of conduct, ob¬ stinately adhered to, naturally induced discontent. His knowledge I Mr. Cockburn, Solicitor-General. 523 / of law was first called in question, and next the warmth and sincerity of the interest he took in his client’s affairs. He is not a wealthy man ; and, as his business began to decline, he felt himself obliged to grasp more eagerly at what offered. But still he adhered to his old habits. In addition to these, which, it must be confessed, did some¬ what sully his original brightness, he acquired a fondness for the business of mediating, an employment not generally understood To be favourable to the preservation of a manly and straight-forward character. Thus, then, stood, perhaps we might say stands, his character with that portion of the public which has most influence over his fortunes. He is esteemed indolent and apathetic, addicted to society, as he is fitted to be its ornament and delight, but more because he seeks his own gratification, than that he is attracted by affection for any with whom he associates — a politician, capable of feeling and appreciating high principles, but too self-indulgent and shuffling to act up to them ; a half-bred lawyer, more anxious to secure the emoluments of his pro¬ fession than to discharge its duties ; a supple and plausible person, who would rather attain his journey’s end by the winding than the straight path, even when the latter was palpably the more advan¬ tageous of the two. Those, however, who have the most close and frequent opportunities of scanning, estimate him more highly and more justly. They know that he possesses fine and elevated senti¬ ments, inflexible rectitude, enduring friendship, and a vigorous mind. They regret, therefore, the more deeply, that his inveterate indo¬ lence, and an indifference to public opinion, engendered not by any undue callousness, but by an unhappy power of banishing all dis¬ agreeable impressions, should have exposed him to such misappre¬ hension. Despite the dimness which he has thus allowed to come over his bright qualities, like the scurf which gathers over silver when exposed to the atmosphere, he can, at any time, when he chooses to exert himself, resume his proper influence over the minds of men. There is an indestructible power in genius which even sloth cannot corrode. Let an impulse sufficiently strong to startle it from its slumbers be applied, and it will rouse from its apathy, and sway men to its will. In the Criminal and Jury Courts, in the General Assembly of the Scottish Church, at public meetings of all kinds, when the sympa¬ thetic enthusiasm of the moment, the excitation of obstacles which he feels he can beat down, or the seductive consciousness that he is uttering the sentiments of all his hearers in words of power, which will redouble their ardour, have kindled up his soul, then it is that you recognize the real Cockburn. In the examination of witnesses, one of the most important duties of an advocate, he is unrivalled. Jeffrey possesses a keenness of in¬ tellectual vision that detects at once any reluctance to utter the whole truth, and brings a moral rack to bear upon the mind of the shuffler, that never fails to squeeze the hidden matter out of him. He possesses also, in an eminent degree, the power of mystifying a witness, and rendering him incapable of saying what he wishes. In other respects he rises, in the performance of this duty, little above the level of other well-employed counsel. But Cockburn is master of the whole 524 Sketches of the Scottish Bar. art. He commences his interrogatories with an air of familiarity and kindness, which at once reconciles the most timid to their situation, emboldens them to tell their own plain story, rather encourages them to speak than puts interrogatories to them. The witness becomes, in some sort, an instrument in his master-hand, and utters only what he is made, by some unaccountable influence, to feel. By some intel¬ lectual freemasonry he is given to understand when he has said enough. On the other hand, should the witness be inclined to con¬ ceal or distort the truth, or state what is false, Cockburn leads him on with the appearance of the most bland conciliatory acquiescence to make one statement after another, until the liar is entangled in the web of his own deceit, and left in the view of all caught in the meshes of his own contradictions. Cockburn’s power is equally eminent in his address to a jury ; in that part of the argument which is virtually directed to the judge — in the legal department, he is scarcely so successful; but over the twelve good men and true he exercises absolute mastery. His figure is small, but not so sensibly so as Jeffrey’s ; neither is he so well formed as the Lord Advocate, whom we can never help regarding in the light of some superior intelligence imprisoned in a highly-finished mi¬ nikin pin. His features are fine — his eye large, lustrous, soft, and dark ; and his voice, which is rich, full, and sonorous, completely re¬ moves all feeling of littleness. His train of argument is in accord¬ ance to the organs through which he gives utterance to his thought. Boldly disregarding all minor or questionable pleas, he seizes upon one or two grand leading views. By his ample concessions he dis¬ arms suspicion, and by the completeness with which he brings the view of the case he chooses to take before his auditors, he confers a magnitude upon it that casts a dark shade over all other considera¬ tions. When he feels himself strong in facts, he states them plainly and explicitly, impressing you, from his rejection of ornament, with the solidity of the structure he is rearing. When he comes to a weak point, he glances it over with a jest, or distracts your attention by some pathetic stroke. His jests, as already remarked, are humorous and witty, and not always new ; but he enters so completely into their spirit, and delivers them with such an intensity of droll expression, that the veriest Joe Miller produces more effect from him than the most refined strokes of wit from another. His pathos, in like man¬ ner, is more of mere feeling than thought, and tells the better on that account, because, while his meaning is level to all capacities, his deep feeling is universally contagious. His enunciation is slow and em¬ phatic, marked with a strong Scotch accent, and, another characteris¬ tic of Scotch orators, a swelling inflection of his sentences, approach¬ ing to an undulating monotony. We cannot say that there is any¬ thing very profound or original in his orations, but there is a strong practical, comprehensive grasp of his subject — a play of fine feeling diffused over its whole management — a music and emphasis in his de¬ livery, that, taken altogether, render him, notwithstanding his pro¬ vincialism, the most effective and, at the same time, most pleasing speaker we have ever heard. But it is not to his eloquence alone that he owes his power over the minds of men ; his excellent discernment enabling him to see what 525 Mr. Cockburn , Solicitor-General. themes he may safely urge, and what are dangerous — his boldness and promptitude in adopting expedients, qualify him eminently for the leader of a popular assembly. It is here that his ready humour stands him most in stead — even the stern Bench is not safe from his fascinations. On one occasion, the counsel opposed to him in some case complained that Mr. Cockburn’s client had not obeyed an order of the Court, that he should vacate some house or shop. Cockburn rose immediately : — “ It is undoubtedly true, my Lords, that my cli¬ ent has not obeyed your Lordships’ injunction to quit the premises in question (here the Lord Justice Clerk drew himself up, and began to look grave and portentous), because, my Lords, he never was within them.” The Bench relaxed into a smile, and listened with unwonted urbanity to the long argument into which he afterwards entered. It is his occasional exhibitions of power, and the great fact, that al¬ though a scion of an influential house, he has been proof to every al¬ lurement of place and pension, has stood firm to his principles, that have retained Cockburn in the confidence of his party. They know that, with all his real and affected apathy, he is theirs ; that the firm ground will as soon shrink from beneath their feet, as he from their side. They know, that in him they possess a champion of redoubted powers, and that when his assistance is needed, they have a spell which can, at any time, conjure up the wild devil within him. He is unfitted for routine drudgery, or for permanent command, by his indolence ; but he is a sort of knight Paladin, upon whom the general may call with confi¬ dence whenever any enterprise is to be achieved “ beyond the mark of others.” It was this conviction that led his own profession and the country at large, to sanction with their approbation the arrangement which, upon the last change of Ministry, raised him to a situation among the members of the bar second only to that held by his friend Jeffrey. In short, the public feeling towards Cockburn is not unlike that which one entertains for a woman who has more the manner than the reality of a coquette : she frets and teazes us, and we would, at times, gladly suspect her, but cannot. One short passage will serve as a not inappropriate termination to this sketch. It is customary that the lawyers appointed to fill the situations of Lord Advocate and Solicitor-General for Scotland, should take the oaths of office, and assume their gowns in open court, when new officers stand within the enclosure between the bar and the bench reserved for themselves and the clerks of court. The whole fifteen judges are assembled, there is a numerous attendance of the faculty, the law agents, and the public. On the occasion when Jef¬ frey and Cockburn underwent this ceremony, the deportment of both was characteristic. The former stood stiffly and bolt upright, his head shooting upwards, as if it had taken a final farewell of his body. Cockburn stood with an air of apathy, like an indifferent spectator, who had got within the bar by mistake.

I once was a happy man ! — My provincial man of business, the keeper of the records of my estate, — used to assure me I was a great man ; and the comely rector of my parish, especially about Whitsun¬ tide or during the venison season, has often plainly hinted to me that I was a good man. What have I done to be upbraided by an uproarious population? — what sin have I committed — what folly ad¬ ventured — to be opprobriated by thrice three thousand souls with the title of an “ old fool,” and an “ old rogue ?” — Oh ! fatal hustings of Grumbleberry ! — What a revolution have your revelations effected in my soul ! — What a subversion have they wrought in all my views and all my feelings ! — After living for sixty-four years as a respectable member of society, I find myself for the first time “ written down an ass,” — and not written down M.

No clerkships ever waited on my solicitation, — my name is unknown at the Horse Guards, — ■ and the Lords of the Admiralty are unmolested by kindred of mine. No acts for turning roads, building bridges, or digging canals on my estate, were ever smuggled through Parliament, under cloak of my influence. I never sought a baronetcy or a dinner at Apsley House ; never angled for loaves in Downing-street, or fishes in the Virginia Water ; — as I said before, I was an independent member, and an independent man. I was born and bred a Tory ; — my family politics have descended to me with my family estates, and I should consider it just as heinous to forswear one, as to mortgage the other. I have long been accus¬ tomed to have my health drunk with three-times-three at all the Corporation dinners of the county, and at the Billy Pitt com¬ memorations all over the kingdom. For forty years past our county Chronicle has unremittingly designated me as “ our worthy mem¬ ber,” — “ our esteemed member,” — and ever since I left off powder and exhibited my unsophisticated gray head as, — “ our venerable mem¬ ber.” The bells were wont to ring for my incomings and outgoings ; when I stopped at a country inn, boots and the ostler extended their horny fists to shake hands with me as they would have done with each other, or some scion of royalty ; — I led a life of praise, and popu¬ larity, and parliament.: “ I remember,” said Pope Benedict XIV. on learning that the Archbishop of Paris was exiled in consequence of a Bull which had been manufactured for him at Rome, and imposed on his acceptance ; “ I remember when I was Legate at Bologna, it was the fashion of the inhabitants to dispute concerning the superiority of Tasso or Ariosto ; and in a fierce duel occasioned by one of these squabbles, a young nobleman was killed. ‘ Alas !’ cried the victim in his dying moments, 4 what had I to do with the merits of Tasso or Ariosto ; I who cannot Soliloquy of an Ex-Member. 527 read, and am but an ass.’ Such is the destiny of the Archbishop of Paris.” And such the fate of my unhappy self! — “ A plague of both their Houses!” — Whigs and Tories, — Wellingtonians, or Althorpians ! I thought my seat for the county as much my own as my seat in the county. >1 looked upon the people as “ my goods, my chattels, my horse, my ass, my every thing — visited their gaols, tasted samples of their prison-bread ; — built tread-mills for them ; — subscribed to peni¬ tentiaries, infirmaries, and lunatic asylums ; — took pity on their hard winters and rainy harvests ; — begged off their convicts from capital punishment, by dancing attendance at the Home Office ; and condemned my daughters to capital punishment, by making it the office of their home department to dance contra-dances with the booby sons of their Squires ! All this martyrdom I endured and dispensed in the service of an ungrateful county ; — expended my pounds and pati¬ ence, — suffered my preserves to be depopulated, my ponds to be netted, my fences to be broken down by the county sportsmen, — and all to be called “ an old rogue,” and an “ old fool,” for opposing a Re¬ form Bill, which is to me as much a matter of indifference as my carpenter’s ! Oh, ye Ijlrumbleberryans ! how hard have I laboured to obtain your applause ! — listened to your own long stories, and told you mine ; stood sponsor for your babes and sucklings, — security, or even bail, for your sons and bucklings, — watched over the common-weal of your com¬ mon-land, — redeemed your heaths from inclosure, and your pecca¬ dilloes from exposure ! — Yet on the hustings of your own particular city, did ye pour upon my unoffending head showers of missiles ex¬ ceeding those of a Vesuvian eruption; and torrents of invectives, such as proclaimed the coinage of the piscatory purlieus of London- bridge. <t rience no rest on the March of Intellect : — there shall still be cakes and ale, — but the cakes shall be gingerbread alphabets, and the ale shall be an aliment of learning ; — the songs at your merry-makings shall be as the Song of Solomon ; — and ye shall be wise in spite of your (wisdom) teeth ! But wherefore do I admonish you ; why yearn over your follies and their retribution ? — Ye have cast me off, — stoned me with your stones, — devoted me to ejection by your votes ! — In spite of my redundant canvass, I have been forced to take in sail ; — and lo ! in my old age I am scuttled on a lee shore. Heaven knows it was not the Reform Bill I cared to oppose, for I knew how it would strengthen my party. But had I deserted the cause of Torydom in its utmost need, and degenerated from the political obstinacy of my forefathers, — ye would have called me rat, — ye would have called me coward, apostate, Iscariot ! — and are not those severer titles of reprobation than an “ old fool,” and an “ old rogue ?” Alas ! alas ! — what prospects of ruin and extermination lie before the devoted squirearchy of this ancient kingdom ! — The tallow- chandler is lugged from his melting vocation, — the brewer from his vat, — the iron-master from his rods, — to grease the wheels of state, — to produce a fermentation among the people, — and flagellate with their irony the discomfited members whose sedentary habits have prevailed for the last half-century ! The country presents at this moment the aspect of a fried whiting, whose head and tail, — the King and Commons, — are joined in unnatural combination. But it is the central portion of the fish which is foredoomed to the jaws of destruction ; it is the middle which will be offered as a sacrifice to the gluttony of the lawless and rapacious multitude ! And what will be the ragged aspect of that head and tail when bereaved of the connecting body ? — Think upon this, ye Muddleberryans ! — think upon it and tremble ! But I forbear ! — Although you lapidated my old age, and pelted me with eggs of most unmeritorious flavour ; — although you no longer hail my travelling carriage “ with pealing steeples and with loud huzzas — although you called me an “ old fool,” and an •“ old rogue,” I forgive the silence of your chimes, and the volubility of your vituperation ; — I pardon your jactancy and petulance, and myopy. Already in my mind's eye I behold my once-loved and now conquered county, writhing in the chains of her imaginary freedom, and feeding with her substance the Hydra-head of a monster of her own creation. I see the tallow-chandlers, and iron-masters, and brewers, sitting as a jury over her felo-de-se , while the fatal word Reform is inscribed as a solitary epitaph on her dishonoured grave. “ Shadows foretell the truth of the substance. The weak lament — the wicked laugh — the Devil wins.” — Aphorisms. By John Magnetus. In the wilder part of Cornwall lived, towards the earlier part of the last century, a beautiful girl, whom I will here call by the name of Clara Tregothick. She was an orphan ; but her fortune had been left to her on the sole condition of marrying with the consent of her uncle, a man of an ambitious and scheming temper. This fortune was such as, had Clara been as old and hideous as she was young and lovely, would have brought to her feet half the proudest gal¬ lants of Cornwall. Among her numerous suitors, two were, however, especially favoured above the rest : their names were Bayntun and Vavasour. The former had won already the consent of the uncle ; the latter had only paid successful court to the bright eyes of the beautiful niece. Bayntun was the heir to high but impoverished rank. Accustomed to the intrigues of cities, a wily and deceitful habit of mind made his chief characteristic : deep, shrewd, self-interested, he seldom engaged in any pursuit without bringing to it all the arts of experience and address, or without foreseeing the exact chances for and against him. It had thus been observed of him, that he was always fortunate in whatever he undertook. He was so — Prudence and Energy united command Fortune. In his early years he had been a daring and suc¬ cessful libertine. Approaching now towards the confines of middle age, the interests of the world had become to him more powerful than its pleasures : there is a lustre in gold that lasts longer undimmed by time, than the smile of women or the sparkle of the wine-cup. Fear¬ ful of sinking into that equivocal and despised state — rank, without the means to support it, he had, for some time, looked abroad for a wealthy marriage. He had prepared himself to disregard youth and beauty : but he found them both united in the object of his choice ; for that object was Clara Tregothick. She did not, it is true, regard him with much favour : once, she had actually refused him. But Sir Frederic Tregothick, her uncle, had pledged himself that the cour¬ tier's addresses should ultimately succeed ; and Bayntun, having once remarked the character of Clara, gave full credence to the assertion. She was, indeed, of a singularly soft and timid nature ; nor did there appear any sacrifice which a consistent violence might not extort from her. Tregothick was deep in the petty cabals which, at that time, constituted politics. Step by step he was feeling his way on¬ ward to public honours ; and he saw, in the alliance of Bayntun — a man destined to one of the oldest of the English Earldoms, and connected with some of the most powerful families in the State — a rapid and certain method of attaining his objects, which should not, he re¬ solved, at whatever risk, be neglected. Living with his niece, who was barely eighteen, he had, the instant the young man’s designs were apparent, forbidden Vavasour access to the house. In spite of this prohibition, the lovers met, however, often, though in se¬ cret. Vavasour was an only son. His father had died many years •since, and he resided with his mother, a bedridden and infirm woman, June. — VOL. XXXI. NO. CXXVI. 2 M 530 The Forewarning. in one of those mouldering and ancient residences common in that part of England; the dilapidations of which his rent-roll did not suffer him to repair. He was a man of generous dispositions, but haughty and fierce in temper : his early poverty, and an ambition constantly crossed and baffled, had given a dark and menacing shade to the brighter qualities of his character. Somewhat of this might be easily discernible in his bearing and aspect ; and, though he was small and spare of person, there was that in his dark eyes, his proud forehead, and an air at once shy and imperious, which testified those angrier and more vindictive properties of nature that prudent men will not willingly arouse. Be this as it may, he could, at least, be softened ; and he loved Clara with a fervour, a depth, and a passion, of which she, in returning his affection, could not even dream. There was a retired and remote spot at one end of the wide chase which surrounded Clara’s abode, in which the lovers were accustomed to meet : hither Vavasour, who resided several miles distant, would ride, on a black horse, whose speed and beauty are yet traditionally preserved ; and, tying his steed within a thick wood, at a little dis¬ tance, proceed to the trysting spot. It was a deep and rugged glen, surrounded by old trees, chiefly pollards, and overrun with fern, which grew in that place with a peculiar and rank luxuriance. None ever disturbed them in this place of rendezvous ; — even the deer seemed to shun it. No path was within nearly a mile of its vicinity, and the neighbouring peasants attached to the glen some ghostly fable, which tended yet farther to preserve its wonted solitude. It was broad noon, in July, when, one day, after an absence of more than ordinary duration, they had again met. The transport that Vavasour evinced heightened the spirit of Clara from its usual fearfulness ; and her lover, perceiving his advantage, did not neglect to press it. “ My beloved Clara,” said he, as her head leaned upon his bosom, a let me prove to the world the sincerity of my love. If you marry without your uncle’s consent, you will lose your fortune. Can you, dearest, consent to the sacrifice? Show that you love me beyond these calculations, and let us fly. I do not conceal from you my poverty ; but, at least, I have quite sufficient to support us. I offer you an honourable name, a peaceful obscurity, and a heart that will seek to recompense you for every thing you will have bartered for its love : — speak, dearest!” “ Indeed, indeed,” said Clara, sighing heavily, “ it is much better to wait. My uncle must be conquered by our constant attachment — by my own dejection and unhappiness. Let us wait. Consider, dear Walter, it is but a few months since we have loved ; and my uncle has, perhaps, a right to appeal to time.” “ Name him not,” said Vavasour fiercely ; “ he has had no right to contemn the alliance of one equal to himself in birth, with the rude¬ ness and disdain that he has evinced to me. But for your sake, I had — but no matter. What I would say,, Clara, is this — every one sees your uncle’s partiality to Henry Bayntun ; every one believes that that ruined profligate will ultimately marry you. Do, Clara, have pity upon me. I do not mistrust you — I will not — I cannot ; — but if, when I hear this said, and see Bayntun every day received at your house, consort¬ ing with you, riding with you, boasting of his favour — if I feel dis- 531 The Forewarning. tracted and maddened, can you wonder, or can you blame me ? Re¬ lease me, Clara, from these fears and this agony, so inseparable from my present situation. Come with me away from them all _ come.” “ Nay, nay,” said Clara, “ you know your power — this is ungene¬ rous !” & “ Can you,” muttered the lover, struck with her refusal, “ can you (it is natuial prefer your fortune, these lands, yonder mansion, to my love ? if so, speak openly, and at once' — I will bless you, and depart.” J “ You are more to me than all !” said Clara, tenderly. “ Then fly !” J Clara wept, and did not answer. So bold a step seemed, to her young fancy, unmaidenly, and exposed to a thousand interpretations, which she recoiled from encountering. At length, a compromise was made ; and it was agreed, that Clara should communicate with her uncle once more, and should firmly assure him, that if he persisted in withholding his consent, she should conceive herself compelled, in justice to the disinterested suit of Vavasour, to submit to all sacrifice, and many without an approbation, which she could not forfeit hap¬ piness to obtain. Vv ith this they parted. The singular will which bequeathed her property to Clara, had de¬ creed the estates, if forfeited by her marriage without Sir Frederick Ti egothick s consent, to a distant relative ; so that in neither case was the uncle benefited by his niece s conduct. It was this which gave to both the lovers some hope that he might, at length, be persuaded to withdraw an opposition, unavailing at all hazards, and in no event advantageous to himself. That very evening, Clara summoned cou- lage, and represented to her guardian all that she had promised Va- vasoui to attempt. He was astonished by the firm and desperate tone she assumed — for she had been deeply wrought upon by Vava- - soui s i emonsti ances ; and, fresh from his exhortation, she displayed a courage and decision wholly contrary to her character. Love makes miiacles though, alas ! they are brief ones ! Sir Frederick at first attempted the imposing and severe manner he had hitherto found successful with his niece. Convinced, at last, of its failure at the present time, he dissembled his chagrin, and observing, with a constrained kindness in his tone, that he must give the subject ma- tuie consideration, that he was actuated solely by the desire of his niece s happiness and what he knew must have been the wishes of his brother, he left the apartment.

is known about the validity of the tool in this population. The aim of this study was to determine whether the SCAS-
P has the same factorial validity in a sample of young peo-
ple with ASD (n = 285), compared to a sample of typically 
developing young people with anxiety disorders (n = 224). Poor model fit with all of the six hypothesised models pre-
cluded invariance testing. Exploratory factor analysis indi-
cated that different anxiety phenomenology characterises 
the two samples. The findings suggest that cross-group 
comparisons between ASD and anxious samples based on 
the SCAS-P scores may not always be appropriate. Keywords  Anxiety · SCAS-P · Measurement invariance ·

DOI 10.1007/s10803-017-3118-0  S.I. : ANXIETY IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS Introduction Anxiety is a common health concern in children with 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), affecting between 
11–84% (White et al. 2009) compared to 3–24% of typi-
cally developing children (Green and Ben-Sasson 2010). A meta-analysis (Van Steensel et  al. 2011) reported that 
nearly 40% of individuals with ASD display clinical levels 
of anxiety and anxiety is one of the most common comor-
bid psychiatric disorders in children with ASD (Simonoff 
et  al. 2008). Furthermore, anxiety problems can lead to 
increased maladaptive behaviour (Kim et al. 2000), unem-
ployment, and chronic mental health difficulties among 
young people with ASD (Farrugia and Hudson 2006). Although the recognition of anxiety problems in ASD has a 
long history, starting as early as with the first description of 
autism by Kanner (1943), the assessment and treatment of 
anxiety in individuals with ASD has only recently begun to 
receive the empirical attention it needs and deserves (Rodg-
ers et al. 2012; White et al. 2009). There remains a critical 
need for the development of valid and reliable assessment 
measures to accurately identify anxiety in children and 
young people with ASD. 1

Queen Victoria Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, UK Introduction Rates reported 
for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety 
disorder (SAD) and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) 
vary widely across studies in ASD (2.6–36.7% for OCD; 
0.5–27.3% for SAD; and 1.2–45.2% for GAD; Van Steen-
sel et al. 2011). Understanding this variability is important 
and it may be that it is influenced by a number of factors, 
including the specific challenges of accurately measuring 
anxiety in ASD. y
The presentation of anxiety in children with and with-
out ASD shares some common features, such as social 
fears that are characteristic of social phobia (Settipani et al. 2012). However, there may also be some unique aspects of 
anxiety in ASD, for example there is evidence for an asso-
ciation between anxiety and both sensory over-responsivity 
(Ben-Sasson et al. 2008; Green and Ben-Sasson 2010) and 
impairment in social functioning in ASD (Bellini 2004, 
2006). Thus, young people with ASD may be predisposed 
to anxiety as a result of a range of ASD-specific factors. Furthermore, there is also evidence that anxiety can exac-
erbate some of the features of ASD, such as repetitive 
behaviours (Sofronoff et al. 2005). Kanner (1943) observed 
that “an insistence on sameness, and the repertoire of fixed 
behaviours and routines” appeared to have a strong asso-
ciation with anxiety (Kanner 1943, as cited in; Gillot et al. 2001, p. 277). Features of ASD and symptoms of anxiety 
may however overlap and prove difficult to delineate (Gje-
vik et al. 2010). For example, repetitive behaviours seen in 
ASD can be difficult to differentiate from the compulsive 
behaviours found in OCD (Zandt et al. 2009). Also atypi-
cal anxiety symptoms have been reported to be associated 
with ASD symptomatology, strengthening the overlap and 
relationship of anxiety and repetitive and restricted behav-
iours in ASD (Kerns et  al. 2014). Furthermore, Mikita 
et  al. (2016) suggested putative links between predispos-
ing ASD traits and subsequent anxiety responses, possi-
bly underpinned by a distinct pathophysiological mecha-
nism. The authors indicated a possibility of distinguishing 
a distinct nosological category of individuals with ASD 
and comorbid anxiety that should be researched in its own 
right. That highlights the need for measures that include 
anxiety-related items that are specific to the phenomenol-
ogy of anxiety in ASD (Rodgers et al. 2016). Rodgers and 
colleagues (2016) have recently developed the first autism-
specific anxiety scale (ASC-ASD) with evidence of good 
reliability and validity. Introduction *	 Jacqui Rodgers

sel, Deutschman and Bögels (2013) evaluated the parent-
report Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disor-
ders (SCARED-71; Bodden et  al. 2009) for use in ASD. They reported that although psychometric properties of the 
measure were comparable for ASD and anxiety-disordered 
groups, alternative cut-off scores were recommended for 
young people with ASD. White, Schry and Maddox (2012) 
provided mixed evidence for the reliability and validity 
of both the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children 
(MASC) and the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inven-
tory-4 ASD Anxiety Scale when used with adolescents 
diagnosed with high functioning autism. The authors found 
that the measures had acceptable internal consistency, and 
there was evidence of discriminant validity, however,the 
youth self-report was found to have a questionable valid-
ity. Kaat and Lecavalier (2015) evaluated the self- and 
parent-reported revised child anxiety and depression scale 
(RCADS) and a more recent version of the MASC among 
youth with ASD and raised some concerns regarding the 
construct validity of anxiety in ASD as measured by these 
scales. More concerns were particularly raised about the 
interpretation and validity of child/youth self-report anxi-
ety screening measures in the ASD group (Mazefsky et al. 2011; White et  al. 2012). Moreover, acceptable internal 
consistency, modest convergent validity, and question-
able divergent validity in separating anxiety from attention 
problems in ASD on the RCADS suggested that more con-
vincing evidence is needed to use the tool in ASD (Sterling 
et al. 2015). and panic disorder. Sukhodolsky et  al. (2008) report the 
prevalence rates for specific phobias, separation anxiety 
and panic disorder in children with ASD aged between 5 
and 17, as 31, 10.5 and 0.0%, respectively. 3 ASD Sample This group consisted of parents of 285 children and ado-
lescents with ASD, recruited from four sources. Most chil-
dren and adolescents (211participants, 181 male, mean age 
in months = 147.95, SD = 24.1; range 8–16 years old) were 
seen by health and education teams in the North East of 
England, recruited through Daslne (Database of Children 
with Autism Spectrum Disorder Living in the North East); 
McConachie et  al. 2009). The second group consisted 
of those who took part in the Beating Anxiety Together 
(BAT) project (McConachie et  al. 2014), an intervention 
programme created for children and adolescents with ASD 
who also had comorbid high anxiety (21 participants, 20 
male, mean age in months = 137.05, SD = 16.22; range 
8.92–13.58  years old). The third group (19 participants, 
16 male, mean age in months = 139.74, SD = 29.66; range 
8.83–15.58 years old) took part in the UK part of the ‘Fun 
and Games’ study investigating decision making styles 
used by individuals with ASD (Boulter et al. 2014; South 
et al. 2014). Finally, 34 participants (29 male, mean age in 
months = 139.50, SD = 35.90; range 7.05–17.09 years old) 
were recruited for a study based at Newcastle University, 
UK, investigating the relation between executive function-
ing, sensory processing and anxiety (Darus, unpublished 
PhD). All children were diagnosed through a multidiscipli-
nary team assessment following the guidelines of the UK 
National Autism Plan for Children (Le Couteur 2003). All 
met criteria for ASD on the Autism Diagnostic Observation 
Schedule (ADOS; Lord et al. 2000), administered and rated To our knowledge, there has been no attempt to use 
measurement invariance to compare separate clinical 
groups. The aims of this study were two-fold. Firstly, to 
determine the factor structure for the SCAS-P in a sample 
of young people with ASD and to compare it with the fac-
tor structure derived from a sample of clinically-anxious 
young people without ASD, and in the combined sample to 
ensure adequate fit to consider invariance. Secondly, to use 
measurement invariance techniques to determine whether 
SCAS-P items function in the same way in children with 
ASD and anxious children without ASD, in order to estab-
lish whether cross-groups comparisons using the SCAS-P 
are appropriate and meaningful. Introduction The Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale-Parent (SCAS-P; 
Spence 1998) is frequently used in ASD research (Chalfant 
et  al. 2006; McConachie et  al. 2014; Rodgers et  al. 2012; 
Russell and Sofronoff 2005; Sung et al. 2011). The SCAS-P 
is a parent-completed questionnaire for assessing the sever-
ity of a range of anxiety symptoms. It has been reported to 
be a reliable and valid tool for screening anxiety symp-
toms in typically developing children (Nauta et  al. 2004). The parent-report measure also has high correspondence 
with the well-validated self-report Spence Children’s Anxi-
ety Scale (SCAS; Nauta et al. 2004). Russell and Sofronoff 
(2005) found both parent and child versions of the question-
naire had high internal reliability in ASD samples. Findings 
from the recent psychometric work done on the question-
naire showed that there was overall moderately good agree-
ment between caregivers’ and ASD children’s reporting of 
anxiety symptoms using the SCAS-P and the SCAS (Magiati 
et al. 2014); and suggested that the SCAS-P could be a use-
ful screening tool for anxiety disorders in ASD (Zainal et al. 2014). A recent systematic review of outcome measures used 
in anxiety intervention studies for high-functioning children 
with ASD suggested that the SCAS-P, its revised version, the 
RCADS, and the SCARED had the most robust measurement Generally, the assessment of anxiety in ASD has relied 
on measures originally validated for use in typically devel-
oping populations (White et  al. 2009). Given the distinct 
challenges of measuring anxiety in ASD, the precision of 1 3 3 J Autism Dev Disord properties (Wigham and McConachie 2014). However, there 
was little or no evidence for some aspects (e.g. responsive-
ness to change and content validity). Little is yet known about 
the reliability or validity of the SCAS-P as a measure of anxi-
ety in children with ASD. parents rate the frequency of occurrence of anxiety symp-
toms on a four-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 
(never) to three (always). Thus, higher scores indicate 
increased levels of anxiety. SCAS-P mean norms for the 
total score in healthy children and young people range 
between 11.8 and 16, increasing to 30.1 to 33 in anxiety 
disordered children and adolescents (Nauta et  al. 2004). Participants The study involved analysis of archival data pooled from 
several different settings. Introduction The scale provides a total anxiety score as well as six sub-
scale scores developed to reflect symptoms characterized 
by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV): panic and agoraphobia; 
separation anxiety; social phobia; physical injury fears; 
OCD, and GAD. The proposed 6-factor structure has been 
supported by confirmatory factor analyses (Nauta et  al. 2004). The SCAS-P is reported to have satisfactory to 
excellent reliability and shows acceptable validity for anx-
ious children (Nauta et al. 2004). properties (Wigham and McConachie 2014). However, there 
was little or no evidence for some aspects (e.g. responsive-
ness to change and content validity). Little is yet known about 
the reliability or validity of the SCAS-P as a measure of anxi-
ety in children with ASD. It remains unclear whether the SCAS-P measures the 
same constructs in ASD as it does in typically developing 
clinically anxious children (without ASD). Moreover, the 
subsequent question of whether this instrument measures 
the construct in the same way, should also be addressed to 
enable valid comparisons of observed scores across groups 
to be made. Further investigation is required to enable con-
fidence that the scale functions in the same way across clin-
ical groups. In order to establish whether a given measure of a par-
ticular latent construct (such as anxiety) performs similarly 
across the groups, it has been suggested that measure-
ment invariance should be first performed (Vandenberg 
and Lance 2000). Only then can meaningful comparisons 
between groups be made as measurement invariance anal-
ysis indicates whether the instrument measures the same 
construct in the same way across different populations or 
groups (Millsap and Kwok 2004).For example, Garnaat 
and Norton (2010) assessed measurement invariance of the 
Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale across four racial/
ethnic groups (namely, White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic). They found generally stable properties although high-
lighted some concern that some scales may underestimate 
diagnosis of OCD in Black groups. ASD Sample Due to concerns raised 
about both validity and interpretation child/youth self-
report anxiety measures in the ASD group, the parent ver-
sion of the SCAS was the main focus of this study. Anxious Sample The anxiety-disorder group included data from parents 
of non-ASD, clinically anxious children and adolescents 
referred to the Berkshire Child Anxiety Clinic, University 
of Reading, UK. SCAS-P data from this sample was col-
lected from parents of 224 (150 male) children and adoles-
cents with a mean age in months of 144.92 (SD = 32.82, 
range 8–17 years old). The mean total score of the SCAS-P 
was 38.47 (SD = 17.02). The means of subscales were as 
follow: panic attack and agoraphobia: 5.44 (SD = 4.93), 
separation anxiety: 7.56 (SD = 4.26), physical injury fears: 
4.60 (SD = 2.77), social phobia: 9.11 (SD = 4.35), obses-
sive compulsive: 3.98 (SD = 3.57), generalized anxiety dis-
order: 7.78 (SD = 3.63). Measure The Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale-Parent Version 
(SCAS-P; Spence 1998) is a 38-item checklist, where The Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale-Parent Version 
(SCAS-P; Spence 1998) is a 38-item checklist, where 1 3 1 3 J Autism Dev Disord an experienced diagnostician (Consultant Clinical Psychol-
ogist). The assessor and the consensus team independently 
allocated diagnoses and CSRs. Following the administra-
tion of 20 child or 20 parent interviews, inter-rater reliabil-
ity for each assessor was checked, and if assessors achieved 
reliability of at least 0.85 they were then required to dis-
cuss one in six interviews with the consensus team (to pre-
vent inter-rater drift). Overall reliability for the team was 
excellent. As different assessors interviewed the parent and 
child simultaneously reliability figures for parent and child 
report were calculated separately. Reliability for presence 
or absence of diagnosis on the ADIS-C/P was kappa = 0.98 
(child report), 0.98 (mother report); and for the CSR intra-
class correlation = .99 (child report), 0.99 (mother report). Reliability for presence or absence of maternal diagnosis 
on the ADIS was kappa = 0.97; and for the CSR intra-class 
correlation = .99. Primary anxiety diagnoses for the sam-
ple were generalised anxiety disorder (n = 55), social pho-
bia (n = 61), separation anxiety disorder (n = 40), specific 
phobia (n = 41), OCD (n = 3), agoraphobia without panic 
disorder (n = 9), anxiety disorder not otherwise specified 
(ADNOS; n = 5), and panic disorder (n = 10). from video by trained raters who maintained over 80% 
agreement with consensus ADOS ratings. In all cases, one 
parent completed the SCAS-P, reporting on their child’s 
symptoms of anxiety. The mean of the SCAS-P total score 
was 33.85 (SD = 19.65) in the ASD sample. The means of 
subscales were as follow: Panic attack and agoraphobia: 
4.75 (SD = 4.48), separation anxiety: 5.97 (SD = 4.12), 
physical injury fears: 4.87 (SD = 3.24), social phobia: 7.26 
(SD = 4.90), obsessive compulsive: 5.00 (SD = 3.93), gen-
eralized anxiety disorder: 6.00 (SD = 3.76). Analysis Plan All analyses were conducted using SPSS 21 (IBM SPSS 
Statistics for Windows, Released 2012) and AMOS 21.0.0 
(Arbuckle 2012) software programs. There were missing 
values only in our anxious sample. There were no particu-
lar patterns in the missing data, allowing the data to be 
treated as missing completely at random. Participants with 
over 20% of missing item level data were removed (n = 3) 
to minimalize randomness in our dataset. For the remaining 
participants the maximum likelihood estimation method of 
data imputation was used to complete the dataset. (
)
For that sample, on receipt of referral, parents completed 
a number of screening questionnaires to ensure that anxi-
ety was the primary concern. This screening included the 
Social Communication Questionnaire to screen for char-
acteristics of ASD (Rutter et  al. 2003). Where children 
scored above clinical cut-offs (≥15) further investigations 
were conducted to ensure that children did not meet crite-
ria for ASD. All children met diagnostic criteria for a pri-
mary anxiety disorder as established by the Anxiety Disor-
ders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV structured interview 
(ADIS-C/P; Silverman and Albano 1996), a structured 
diagnostic interview with well-established psychometric 
properties (Silverman et  al. 2001). Where children met 
symptom criteria for a diagnosis they were assigned a clini-
cal severity rating (CSR) ranging from 0 (complete absence 
of psychopathology) to eight (severe psychopathology). As 
is conventional, overall diagnoses and CSRs were assigned 
if the child met diagnostic criteria on the basis of either 
child or parent report, and the higher CSR of the two was 
taken. Only those who met symptom criteria with a CSR of 
four or more (moderate psychopathology) were considered 
to meet diagnostic criteria. Assessors (psychology gradu-
ates) were trained on the administration and scoring of the 
ADIS and ADIS-C/P through verbal instruction, listening 
to assessment audio-recordings and participating in diag-
nostic consensus discussions. The first 20 interviews con-
ducted were then discussed with a consensus team, led by Confirmatory Factor Analysis In the anxious, ASD and combined (both anxious and 
ASD) samples, six models, including: (1) one factor, (2) 
six uncorrelated factors, (3) six correlated factors, (4) six 
correlated factors and one higher order factor, (5) five cor-
related factors and generalized anxiety as one higher-order 
factor, and (6) five correlated factors (with GAD subscale 
excluded), were tested. The goodness of fit indices are sum-
marised in Table 1. Overall, fit indices fell below the generally recom-
mended ranges for good fit in each model. Due to poor 
models’ fit subsequent invariance testing was not conducted 
as there was not enough evidence to assess invariance. Measurement Invariance The measurement invariance technique can be implemented 
by running a multi-group analysis of the factor structure 
that underlies the data of two groups (Byrne and Camp-
bell 1999). The following sequence of four nested models 
is usually tested (see Cheung and Rensvold 2002; Schmitt 
and Kuljanin 2008): configural invariance; metric invari-
ance; scalar invariance; and residual (uniqueness) invari-
ance. In the configural invariance model, the same factor 
structure is implied for two or more groups of participants 
entered into the analysis. The values of the parameters (i.e. factor loadings, intercepts, residual variances) may vary 
across the groups, as no equality constraints are imposed. In the metric invariance model whether the values of the 
factor loadings are the same across groups is tested; hence 
item loadings are constrained to be equal across groups. Scalar invariance tests latent factor mean differences across 
groups and is evaluated by constraining the intercepts of 
measures to be the same across groups. In the residual 
model items unique variances are constrained to be equal Confirmatory Factor Analysis Confirmatory Factor Analysis In order to determine the factor structure of the SCAS-P, a 
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), using structural equa-
tion modelling, in AMOS, was conducted with data from 
the anxious and ASD samples separately, and then in the 
combined sample, in order to determine the best-fitting fac-
tor structure and assess invariance. Six hypothesised mod-
els were tested subsequently. Five were the DSM-IV-based 
symptom models suggested by Nauta et al. (2004) includ-
ing: (1) one factor, (2) six uncorrelated factors, (3) six cor-
related factors, (4) six correlated factors and one higher 
order factor, and (5) five correlated factors and generalized 
anxiety as one higher-order factor. For anxiety disordered 
children, as suggested by Nauta et al. (2004), support was 
found for six intercorrelated factors (separation anxiety, 
generalized anxiety, social phobia, panic/agoraphobia, 3 3 J Autism Dev Disord OCD, and fear of physical injuries) and a model with gen-
eralized anxiety as the higher order factor for the other five 
factors. There is no support in the literature that either of 
the models would fit ASD sample. The sixth model tested 
in this study was based on work done by Jamieson et al. (unpublished thesis, 2012) who suggested that five corre-
lated factors (with GAD subscale excluded) might be the 
best-fitting factor structure for children and adolescents 
with ASD. All models were tested in order to establish 
whether any of the hypothesised models would provide the 
fitting factor structure for either of the samples. across the two (or more) comparison groups. As suggested 
by Chen (2007), suggested differences in both CFI (delta 
CFI <0.01) and RMSEA (RMSEA <0.015) values were 
considered when comparing two nested models e.g. metric 
and scalar invariance. Preliminary and Descriptive Statistics Examining the SCAS-P samples, anxious and ASD par-
ticipants did not significantly differ on age. A significant 
difference was found for gender, with more female partici-
pants in the anxious sample. However, this difference rep-
resents the general sex ratio typical for the ASD population, 
with more males than females diagnosed with the condition 
(Werling and Geschwind 2013). i
Model fit was evaluated using established recommenda-
tions identified as “best behaved” on the basis of previous 
research (Brown 2006, p. 85; Hu and Bentler 1999). For 
example, we followed recommendations that χ2/df ratio 
(Bryant and Yarnold 1995) should be close to zero and 
that root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) 
values close to 0.06 represent good fit (Hu and Bentler 
1999), whilst values less than 0.08 are indicative of accept-
able fit, and values between 0.08 and 0.10 represent poor 
model fit (Browne and Cudeck 1993). It is recommended 
that the comparative fit index (CFI) is greater than 0.95, but 
a level greater than 0.9 being acceptable (Hu and Bentler 
1999). It is also recommended that the Tucker-Lewis index 
(TLI) is greater than 0.90 to demonstrate good fit (Brown 
2006). The non-significant Chi square (χ2) statistic (Brown 
2006) may be used an indicator of fit, however, because it 
is greatly influenced by sample size (Stevens 2002), we did 
not use in isolation from other recommended goodness of 
fit indices. The Chi square difference test was also used to 
compare competing models. Table 1   Fit indices for six

RMSEA <0.6, CFI >0.95 and TLI >0.9 (Brown 2006; Hu and Bentler 1999) of being in crowded places (like shopping centres, the mov-
ies, buses, busy playgrounds)’ and item 28 ‘All of a sudden 
my child feels really scared for no reason at all’) grouped 
together with one GAD item (item 22 ‘when my child has 
a problem, (s)he feels shaky) and one physical injury item 
(item 21 ‘My child is scared of going to the doctor or den-
tist’). Post‑hoc Analysis Due to the poor model fit with any of the six hypothesised 
models, we investigated the factor structure of the SCAS-
P in the anxious and ASD samples with exploratory factor 
analysis (EFA). Parallel analysis and Velicer’s minimum 
average partial (MAP) test were performed to determine the 
number of components in the factor analyses. These vali-
dated procedures are superior to the eigenvalues greater-
than-one rule (O’Connor 2000). In the ASD and anxious 
sample parallel analysis indicated an eight factor solution. The MAP test indicated six factors in the ASD sample and 
seven factors in the anxious sample. When differences in 
test results emerge, optimal decisions should be made after 
considering the results of both analytic procedures bearing 
in mind that the MAP test tends to underextract the num-
ber of factors, whereas parallel analysis tends to overextract 
the number of factors (O’Connor 2000). Post‑hoc Analysis A second factor related to the majority of the physi-
ological symptoms of anxiety (item 32 ‘My child’s com-
plains of his/her heart suddenly starting to beat to quickly 
for no reason’, item 12 ‘My child complains of suddenly 
feeling as if (s)he can’t breathe when there is no reason for 
this’, item 30 ‘My child complains of suddenly becoming 
dizzy or faint when there is no reason for this’ and GAD 
item 18 ‘when my child has a problem, (s)he complains of 
his/her heart beating really fast’). These three items relate 
to physiological symptoms of panic experience, includ-
ing the ability to recognise those symptoms (e.g. increased 
heart beat) and communicate those changes in the body 
functions to others. factor solution in the anxious sample, one factor consisted 
only of two items. The six factor solution in the ASD sam-
ple and seven factor solution in the anxious sample were 
considered as the most optimal. Maximum Likelihood 
extraction with oblique rotation was used because high cor-
relations between the components were found (above 0.4 
and below −0.4 in both groups) (Tables 2, 3). For both groups the social phobia factor was derived and 
was very similar to the original social phobia factor (Nauta 
et al. 2004), with only item seven (‘My child is afraid when 
(s)he has to use public toilets or bathrooms’) not loading 
onto that factor. Also an OCD factor was derived that was 
similar to the original suggested by Nauta and colleagues 
(2004), however it consisted of only four items in the ASD 
group and three items in the anxious group. For the ASD 
group the other four factors comprised mostly of items 
belonging to the OCD, GAD, panic attack and agorapho-
bia, and separation anxiety subscales. Interestingly, panic 
attack and agoraphobia items loaded on two different fac-
tors. One factor included four items (item 19 ‘My child 
suddenly starts to tremble or shake when there is no reason 
for this’, item 25 ‘My child feels scared if (s)he has to travel 
in the car, or on a bus or train’, item 27 ‘My child is afraid A split in the original panic and agoraphobia factor was 
also found in the anxious sample. Post‑hoc Analysis Content—summarized items content. E Eigenvalue. Communali-

ety-related behaviours that children exhibit, unless they 
verbalize their subjective and individual experiences. It is 
likely, particularly for our ASD sample, that parents were 
not aware of some of the symptoms or their severity and 
frequency. The reason why we could not find the baseline 
model of the SCAS-P in the anxious sample is unknown. other factor was more agoraphobia specific (e.g. item 34 
‘My child is afraid of being in small closed places, like tun-
nels or small rooms’). Also OCD items separated into two 
distinct factors in the anxious typically developing group, 
with one relating to compulsions (e.g. item 37 ‘My child 
has to do certain things in just the right way to stop bad 
things from happening’), the other to obsessive thoughts 
(e.g. item 17 ‘My child can’t seem to get bad or silly 
thoughts out of his/her head’). Another factor that was indi-
cated for the anxious group comprised of various separa-
tion anxiety, GAD and panic attack and agoraphobia items 
(e.g. item 33 ‘My child worries that (s)he will suddenly get 
a scared feeling when there is nothing to be afraid of’). The 
last factor consisted of two separation anxiety items (item 
five ‘My child would feel afraid of being on his/her own at 
home’ and item 14 ‘My child is scared if (s)he has to sleep 
on his/her own’) and one physical injury fears item (item 
two ‘My child is scared of the dark’). Post‑hoc Analysis Some of the items loaded 
on to a physiological symptoms of anxiety factor (with 
additional items from the original GAD factor) while the 1 3 3 J Autism Dev Disord or analysis of SCAS-P in ASD sample

.56 3 J Autism Dev Disord Loading derived from maximum likelihood estimation with oblimin rotation. Post‑hoc Analysis Items from across a 
range of the original subscales loaded on to the other fac-
tors in the anxious sample, with factor four including items 
ranging from separation anxiety to being scared of dark-
ness, and factor five including items related to anxious 
thoughts and factor seven encompassing specific phobias. Using EFA, a six-factor model was established for 
the ASD sample, and a seven-factor model was found to 
describe the anxious sample best. The findings here for 
both groups differ from the SCAS-P factor structure sug-
gested by Nauta et al. (2004), who found that six correlated 
factors fit the data obtained from the parents/caregivers of 
anxiety-disordered children best. Indeed, for the clinically 
anxious group we only found partial support for the panic 
attack and agoraphobia, OCD and social phobia factors. However, even within these factors some anomalies were 
found. Even less support for the original factor structure of 
the SCAS-P was found in the ASD sample. The study showed limited support for the original fac-
tor structure of the SCAS-P. It is a novel, inconsistent with 
previous emotional functioning and personality literature 
(e.g., Hoelzle and Meyer 2009; Hopwood and Donnellan 
2010; O’Connor 2002) finding. Some concerns, however, 
have been raised previously with regards to the validity 
of the SCAS-P, particularly of the GAD subscale for use 
with typically developing children. Spence et  al. (2001) 
argued that this sub-scale could indicate more negative 
affect and autonomic responding than generalized anxiety, 
and found little support for a separate GAD-subscale. The 
content validity of the GAD subscale has been also ques-
tioned because it lacks overt reference to excessive worry 
(Chorpita et al. 1997), which is considered to be a central 
feature of GAD in childhood and adolescence. Our findings 
support these concerns, as a distinct GAD factor was not 
found in either our anxious or ASD samples. The physi-
cal injury fear factor was also not established for either of 
the samples. The reliability of the subscale, however, has 
been questioned previously, with unacceptable to ques-
tionable Cronbach’s alpha reported across community and 
clinical samples in various countries (Arendt et al. 2014; 
Whiteside and Brown 2008; Zainal et al. 2014). Although 
in the RCADS, a revised version of the SCAS-P, the meas-
urement properties of GAD appeared to have improved Discussion The first aim of this study was to determine the factor struc-
ture for the SCAS-P in a sample of young people with ASD 
and to compare it with the factor structure derived from a 
sample of clinically-anxious young people without ASD, 
and in the combined sample to ensure adequate fit to con-
sider invariance. However, due to poor model fit and inabil-
ity to find an adequate baseline model for further between-
group model testing, measurement invariance analyses 
could not be performed. Inability to find a model with a 
fixed number of factors in each group for the measure that 
has an established factor structure for use with typically 
developing samples was an unexpected outcome. Similarly, 
White et al. (2015) could not pursue the multigroup invari-
ance factor analysis on the MASC parent version (but could 
on the MASC self-report), because the CFA undertaken on 
the typically developing anxious youth did not confirm the 
conventional MASC-P structure. Discussion Content—summarized items content. E Eigenvalue. Communali-

the questionnaire. An important limitation to this study is that our anxious

explore the validity of SCAS-P items in ASD samples. In 
line with other studies we recommend that the GAD and 
physical injury fears subscales require additional reliability 
and validity checks across clinical and community sam-
ples. Adaptation of the questionnaire is needed for reliable 
and valid use with ASD individuals. Qualitative interviews 
with parents should be conducted to better understand the 
context and particular situations in which caregivers base 
their answers. According to our findings, further work is needed on 
the SCAS-P to establish its reliability and validity, par-
ticularly when used with the ASD population. Zainal 
and colleagues (2014) reported in their preliminary 
investigation, the SCAS-P might be a useful screen-
ing tool of anxiety in children with ASD when assess-
ing elevated anxiety symptoms and relying on the total 
score. We suggest that a further caution is needed when 
using the tool to assess particular anxiety subtypes and 
make cross-groups comparisons between children with 
ASD and children diagnosed with anxiety disorder based 
on the SCAS-P scores. Although Wigham and McCo-
nachie (2014) reported that the SCAS-P was one of the 
tools to have the most robust measurement properties in 3 J Autism Dev Disord Conclusions Barrington, J., Prior, M., Richardson, M., & Allen, K. (2005). Effectiveness of CBT versus standard treatment for childhood 
anxiety disorders in a community clinic setting. Behaviour 
Change, 22(1), 29–43.i The SCAS-P has been developed and validated for use with 
typically developing youth. To use the scale as a reliable 
measure of anxiety in young people with ASD further work 
is needed. Researchers and clinicians should not rely solely 
on the scores obtained from the SCAS-P when assessing 
anxiety symptoms in individuals with ASD. Further and 
more systematic quantitative and qualitative research would 
be required to turn the SCAS-P into a robust measure of 
anxiety for use in ASD practice or research. Bellini, S. (2004). Social skills deficits and anxiety in high func-

Article: | iLEMMON, Justice.
This is an action to recover damages sustained by plaintiff in an automobile accident in which the tortfeasor was driving her own automobile while in the course and scope of her employment. The tortfeasor's liability insurer undisputedly provided primary eover-age for the accident. The dispute presently before the court, raised by motions for summary judgment, involves the liability insurer's contention that the tortfeasor's employer's business automobile insurer also provided primary coverage under the policy's "Other Insurance" provisions, which stipulated primary coverage for liability assumed by the insured (the employer) under an "insured contract." The principal issue is whether the employment relationship between the employer and the employee constituted an "insured contract," as defined in the employer's policy.
|2Plaintiff was involved in a two-car accident with an employee of the St. Martin Parish School Board. The driver was in the course and scope of her employment, but was driving her own automobile when the collision occurred. Plaintiff filed this action against the other driver and her liability insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.
State Farm then filed a third party demand against Titan Indemnity Company. While conceding that its policy provided primary coverage for the accident, State Farm asserted that Titan's business automobile policy issued to the St. Martin Parish School Board provided co-primary coverage for the accident.
Both parties filed motions for a summary judgment on the issue of primary insurance coverage under Titan's policy, which provided for "Other Insurance" as follows:
5. OTHER INSURANCE
a. For any covered 'auto' you own, this Coverage Form provides primary insurance. For any covered auto you don't own, the insurance provided by this Coverage Form is excess over any other collectible insurance....
 , " . . " b. Regardless of the provisions of para-f , . * graph a above, this Coverage Forms . . " Liability Coverage is pnmani for any J & r j j » liability assumed under an insured contract", (emphasis added).
State Farm conceded that the coverage provided by Titan's policy would be excess absent the language of Paragraph 5(b). See Juan v. Harris, 279 So.2d 187|3(La.1973). State Farm contended. howev^Tthat the School Board, in the employment agreement between the School Board and its employee, assumed liability for its employee's tortious conduct and the employment agreement therefore constituted an "insured contract" under the "Other Insurance" provisions of Titan's policy.
The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Titan, holding that Titan's policy provided only excess coverage and therefore was not available until the State Farm policy limits were exhausted.
The court of appeal reversed. No. 93-1464 (La.App. 3rd Cir. 6/1/94); 638 So.2d 682. The court held that Titan's coverage was also primary, because the employment contract between the employee and the School Board was an "insured contract" under the "Other Insurance" provisions of the Board's policy and Titan's coverage was primary for any liability assumed by the Board under an "insured contract."
We granted certiorari. 94-2204 (La. 12/9/94); 647 So.2d 1100. For the following-reasons, we now reverse and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.
 An insurance policy is a contract between the parties and should be construed by using the general rules of interpretation of contracts provided in the Civil Code. Louisiana Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Interstate Fire and Casualty Co., 93-0911 (La. 1/14/94); 630 So.2d 759, 763; Smith v. Matthews, 611 So.2d 1377, 1379 (La.1993). The interpretation of a contract is the determination of the common intent of the parties. The words of a contract must be given their generally prevailing meaning, and when the words of a . , . , , contract are clear and explicit and lead to no , , absurd consequences, no further mterpreta- ,. , , . t. * ¿1. • * ¿ * tlon may made m search of the intent of parties. La.Civ.Code arts. 2045-2047.
M critical issue is whether the em-Payment agreement constituted an Ji>ured contract" within the contemplation of the business automobile policy. Titan's Pollcy defined an insured contract" as:
1. A lease of premises;
2. A sidetrack agreement;
3. An easement or license agreement in connection with vehicle or pedestrian private railroad crossings at grade;
4. Any other easement agreement, except in connection with construction or demolition operations on or within 50 feet of a railroad;
5. An indemnification of a municipality as required by ordinance, except in connection with work for a municipality; or
6. That part of any other contract or agreement pertaining to your business under which you assume the tort liability of another to pay damages because of "bodily injury" or "property damage" to a third person or organization, if the contract or agreement is made prior to the "bodily injury" or "property damage." Tort liability means a liability that would be imposed by law in the absence of any contract of agreement, (emphasis added).
 State Farm contends that the School Board, in contracting to hire its employee, assumed the employee's tori liability because La.Civ.Code art. 2320 renders an employer liable for the torts of its employee committed in the course and scope of employment. State Farm therefore argues that the employment agreement constituted an "insured contract" and rendered Titan's coverage primary under Paragraph 5(b) of Titan's policy.
Titan, on the other hand, argues that the School Board did not "assume the tort liabili ty of another" under the employment contract, but that the Board's liability for its employee's torts arose vicariously by operation of law. An assumption of liability by contract, according to Titan, implies that the liability would not exist without the assumption, and since La.Civ.Code art. 2320 imposes liability on an employer for the tortious conduct of its employee, the Board never "assume[d] the tort liability of another."
|5The key word is "assume." The definition of "assume" is "to take on, become bound as another is bound, or put oneself in place of another as to an obligation or liability." Black's Law Dictionary 122 (6th ed.1990). A second definition is "to take upon oneself (the debts or obligations of another)." Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 91 (1989).
 Under these definitions, the word "assume" in Titan's policy requires some exercise of volition on the part of the insured to undertake or incur liability which did not exist prior to the assumption. In this case, the employment contract merely gave rise to the status of the School Board as an employer. It was the law governing that status, and not any contractual assumption of liability, which made the School Board liable for its employee's tort. Furthermore, the word "another" in the pertinent policy provision, which apparently refers to an unrelated person for whom the Board would not be liable in the absence of contractual assumption of liability, supports the conclusion that the provision does not apply to the employees for whom the insured is vicariously liable by operation of law.
State Farm further argues that since an insurance policy is an adhesionary contract, any contradiction or ambiguity should be construed against Titan, the party who drafted the policy. See La.Civ.Code art. 2056; Insurance Co. of North America v. Solari Parking, 370 So.2d 503, 507 (La.1979). This general rule of construction, however, only applies when there are two equally reasonable interpretations of the contractual provision in question. Louisiana Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Interstate Fire and Casualty Co., 93-0911 (La. 1/14/94); 630 So.2d at 770.
 In the present case, the named insured was the Board, which could only incur liability through the actions and omissions of its employees. Acceptance of State Farm's suggested interpretation of the policy would lead to the finding of primary coverage in every case, thereby rendering meaningless and without effect the excess ^provisions for non-owned automobiles in Paragraph 5(a) of Titan's policy. Each provision of a contract must be interpreted in light of the other provisions, and a provision susceptible of different meanings must be interpreted with a meaning that renders it effective rather than one which renders it ineffective. La.Civ. Code arts. 2049-2050.
Moreover, the Civil Code articles and corresponding jurisprudence which mandate strict construction are primarily designed to protect an unwary policyholder from the "small print" often injected into insurance contracts by those with superior bargaining power. See Golz v. Children's Bureau of New Orleans, 326 So.2d 865, 869 (La.1976). The present case involves a dispute between two insurance companies, and the insured is afforded the same protection regardless of whether Titan's coverage is interpreted to be primary or excess.
We therefore conclude that the School Board's employment agreement with its employee was not an "insured contract" by which the School Board "assume[d] the tort liability of another." Accordingly, the coverage provided by Titan's policy is excess.
The judgment of the court of appeal is reversed, the judgment of the trial court is reinstated, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.
Judge Charles R. Lindsay, Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, sitting by assignment in place of Justice James L. Dennis. Pursuant to Rule IV, Part 2, § 3, Judge Lindsay was not on panel.
 . 1. State Farm's policy provided: "[I]f our vehicle liability coverage applies, we are liable only for our share of the damages. Our share is the percent that the limit of liability of this policy bears to the total of all vehicle liability coverage applicable to the accident." State Farm's policy limits were $100,000. The limits of Titan's policy were $1,000,000. Therefore, if State Farm is correct that Titan's policy also provided primary coverage, State Farm will be liable for only a small portion of the damages. Otherwise, State Farm will be liable for the first $100,000 of damages, with Titan liable only for any damages in excess of that amount..

Article: php search, show php template based on search return
I am still learning and any help would be appreciated. HTML is pretty bare bones. No styles or anything like that yet, all on just localhost for testing. So I do not have a example set up live.
I am using just PHP and a table in phpmyadmin. The files I have are index.php(form is here), search.php(search code stored here), provider1.php, provider2.php, provider3.php, provider4.php.
So far I have a table that is stored with these columns:Provider,state full name, city, state, zip code. I have a search form that users enter a zip code and if the zip code matches a row in the table, it looks at the provider, checks which one it is (provider1, provider2, provider3, provider4).On the search.php it echos out how many choices they have, where the city state is from the zip code and then also echos the zip code that they entered.
My question is how can I tell it so if that zip code has a provider, to use that provider.php. Example:
92804 = provider1, so then use provider1.php and also still echo out they city and state that goes with that zip code.
index.php:
    <!doctype html>

search.php:
 <?php

mysql_connect("localhost","root","root") or die("could not connect");
mysql_select_db("zipcodes") or die("could not find db");

//collect
if (isset($_GET['search'])) {
    $searchq = $_GET['search'];
    $searchq = preg_replace("#[^0-9a-z]#i","",$searchq);

    $query = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM `TABLE 1` WHERE `Zip Code` = '$searchq'") or die("could not search");
    $count = mysql_num_rows($query);
    if($count == 0) {
        $output = 'There was no search results!!';
    }else {
        while($row = mysql_fetch_array($query)) {
            $city = $row['City'];
            $state = $row['State'];
            $provider = $row['Provider Name'];

            $output = '<div> '.$provider.' '.$city.' '.$state.' </div>';
        }
    }

}

switch ($provider) {
    case "provider1":
        //put code here that tells it to use provider1.php
        break;
    case "provider2":
        //put code here that tells it to use provider2.php
        break;
    case "provider3":

    This is just a results page for testing. This page needs to know what zip to match to a provider, then go to that page.
    <p>You have <?php echo $count ?> choices</p>
    <p>Your provider is <?php echo $provider ?></p>
    <p>You are located in <?php echo $city ?>, <?php echo $state ?> </p>
    <p>The zip code you searched was <?php echo $searchq ?></p>

provider1.php:
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title><?php echo $provider ?> in <?php echo $city ?>, <?php echo $state ?></title>
</head>

<body>
This would be a template for provider1
<p>You have <?php echo $count ?> choices</p>
<p>You are located in <?php echo $city ?>, <?php echo $state ?> </p>
<p>The zip code you searched was <?php echo $searchq ?></p>
</body>
</html>

Is this possible to do? or do I need to use something like laravel to get it started or some type of framework.

What are the data sets you are dealing with? Is it just pure integers between a set range?
If so you could just do something like this:
if($provider > 92804 && < 92806){
include 'provider1.php';
}elseif($provider > 92807 && < 92809){
include 'provider2.php';
}else{
// No provider, try again
}

Alternatively you may be able to use something such as the preg_match function which would probably be the better scalable solution when dealing with large data sets.

I did not know I could just use "include" and then the template that I needed. This is simple enough and does the trick. This may be for a new question, or you can point me in the right direction, when it does search, the url is /search-zip.php?search=92804. Is there a way to clean this up, I looked and it looks like something to do with php route? Any help appreciated. Thank you.

Yes you can do that, you may change it to something such as /search-zip.php/92804. To do this you could use rewrite rules, do some research on them. A term for cleaning up the URL in reference to what you mean is sometimes referred to as "pretty urls", searching this on the web will also return a number of related results to your question.

Article: What is the derivative of an iterated product like $ \frac{d}{dx}\prod \limits_{i=0}^n \ln(y_i^{x - 1})$?
Suppose the following function with pi notation, with the pi denoting the iterated product, multiplying from $i = 0$ to $i = n$:
$$\prod_{i=0}^n \ln(y_i^{x - 1})$$
That is, the natural logarithm of $y$, subscripted by $i$, to the power of $x - 1$.
What is the derivative of this product - to be clear, its derivative with respect to $x$, not $y$? 

For future reference, it is preferred you write your posts in MathJax on MSE. I have already done that for you, with some rewording and such to clarify your intent. Generally, though, it will be preferred if you include your own attempts at this problem in your post - people on MSE respond better when you include your own attempts and work, your own understanding of the problem, and the context where this pops up. As-is, I feel your post will likely accumulate downvotes and close votes despite my edits. You're more than welcome to edit your post to include these details though.

A few further comments, now on the problem itself. What are the $y_i$'s, necessarily? Also, have you considered simply brute forcing with the product rule? There's a generalization for when you have more than $2$ functions as a product and you're trying to take the derivative of them. It's touched on in this MSE post -- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1348251/proving-the-product-rule-for-n-functions

Hi sorry this is my first post on MSE so I didn't know to use MathJax. Thank you for editing. I am not able to solve this as I don't understand how to proceed, and searching for the answer has proved fruitless thus I posted here.

We don't even need a product rule. We have
\begin{align*}
g(x) = \prod_{i=0}^{n}\ln(y_i^{x-1}) = (x-1)^{n+1}\prod_{i=1}^{n}\ln(y_i)
\end{align*}
And so
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = (n+1)(x-1)^{n}\prod_{i=0}^{n}\ln(y_i)
\end{align*}

Very well done! +1

Define $\alpha=\prod_{i=0}^n \ln(y_i)$. Note that $\alpha$ is simply a constant. Use logarithm properties, use the power rule for derivatives and you're done.
$$f(x)=\prod_{i=0}^{n}\ln{y_i}^{x-1}=\prod_{i=0}^{n}(x-1)\ln{y_i}$$$$\alpha(x-1)^{n+1}\implies \dfrac{\mathrm df}{\mathrm dx}=\alpha(n+1)(x-1)^n$$
$$\boxed{\dfrac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dx}\prod_{k=0}^n \ln{y_i}^{x-1}=(n+1)(x-1)^n\prod_{k=0}^n\ln y_i}$$

Let 
$$f(x)=\prod_{i=0}^{n}f_i(x)$$
and let $$g^{(m)}(x)=\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^mg(x),\qquad m=0,1,2,...$$
as well as $\delta_{ij}$ denote the Kronecker Delta.
We have that
$$f'(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\prod_{j=0}^{n}f_j^{(\delta_{ij})}(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{f_i'(x)}{f_i(x)}f(x)$$
We use this with the choice 
$$f_i(x)=\ln(y_i^{x-1})=(x-1)\ln y_i$$
which gives $$f_i'(x)=\ln y_i$$
So 
$$f'(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{1}{x-1}\prod_{j=0}^{n}(x-1)\ln y_j$$
$$f'(x)=(x-1)^n\sum_{i=0}^{n}\prod_{j=0}^{n}\ln y_j$$
$$f'(x)=(x-1)^n\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n}1\right)\prod_{j=0}^{n}\ln y_j$$
$$f'(x)=(n+1)(x-1)^n\prod_{j=0}^{n}\ln y_j$$

 SECOND SESSION OF THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE OF THE UNITED
 NATIONS CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT
 Draft Charter.
The Delegation of the United States of America submit
 the following proposals for amendment, of Article 30 of the
 Draft Charter:
 SECTION D. SUBSIDIES
 Article 30
 General undertaking regarding subsidies -- Elimination of
 export subsidies -- Exceptions
 1.
2. (a) No Member shall grant, directly or indirectly,
 any subsidy on the expertation of any product, or establish
 or maintain any other system, which results in the sale of
 such product for export at a price lower than the comparable
 price charged for the like product to buyers in the domestic
 market, due allowance  being made for differences in the
 conditions and terms of sale, for difference in taxation,
 and for other differences affecting price comparability,
 Provided that this sub-paragraph shall  not prevent any Member
 from exempting exported products from duties or taxes im-
 posed in respect of like products when consumed domestically,
 from remitting such duties or taxes which have occrued, or
 from using the proceeds of such duties or taxes to make
 payments to domestic producers;
 COMMENT: The proposed addition is to make quite
 clear that the proviso does not exempt
 subsidies paid out of the proceeds of
 processing taxes from the requirements
 of paragraph 1.  The New York Drafting
 P.T.O. E/PC/T/W/185
 page 2
 Committee considered this clear and
 deleted the reference to paragraph 1
 that had been in the proviso. The
 proposed revision should remove any
 doubt.
(b)
 3.
 4. (a)  In any case of subsidization of a primary com-
 modity, if a Member considers that its interests are seriously
 prejudiced by the subsidy or if the Member granting the sub-
 sidy considers itself unable to comply with the provisions
 of paragraph 2 of this Article within the time limit laid
 down therein, the Member may have resort to the procedures of
 [the difficulty may be determined to be a special diffi-
 culty of the kind referred to in] Chapter VII [, and in that
 event the procedure laid down in that Chapter shall be fol-
 lowed];
 COMMENT: The procedure of Chapter VII requires
 the determination by a study group or
 a commodity conference that there is a
 special difficulty.
(b)
 5.
6. Any determination required by or appropriate to the
 operation of this Article shall be made through [under pro-
 cedures established by]  the Organization by consultation
 among the Members substantially interested in the product
 concerned [in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 66].
COMMENT: The revised paragraph would incorporate

Article: As to Hort’s suggestion on the word κύριος, that the original was ὅτι 6 (λαὸν σώσας), 1 think the fact of the variants is better explained by Spitta, who considers that the abbreviations I€, KC, 6€ might easily be confused, if the first letter was faintly written, and that 1“ This is an error: the two best MSS. of ῥ represent wavra.” α. INTRODUCTION 247 the mention of τὸν µόνον δεσπότην καὶ Κύριον Ἰ. X. in the preceding verse would naturally lead a later copyist to prefer iC, a supposition which is confirmed by Cramer’s Catena, p. 158, εἴρηται γὰρ πρὸ τούτων περὶ αὐτοῦ, ὡς εἴη ἀληθινὸς θεὸς οὗτος ὁ µόνος δεσπότης 6 κύριος ο ὁ ἀναγαγὼν τὸν λαὸν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου διὰ Μωσέως Spitta himself however holds that 6€ is the true reading, as it agrees with the corresponding passage in 2 Peter ii. 4, 6 Θεὺς ἀγγέλων ἁμαρτησάντων οὐκ ἐφείσατο, and with Clement’s paraphrase (A4dumbr. Dind. iii. p. 482) : “ Quoniam Dominus Deus semel populum de terra Aegypti liberans deinceps eos qui non crediderunt perdidit”. There is no instance in the New Testament of the personal name “Jesus” being used of the pre- existent Messiah, though the official name “Christ” is found in 1 Cor. x. 4, 9, in reference to the wandering in the wilderness. But in the second and later centuries this distinction was less carefully observed. Thus Justin M. (Dial. 120), speaking of the prophecy in Genesis xlix. 10, says that it does not refer to Judah, but to Jesus, τὸν καὶ τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἐξαγαγόντα, and this use of the name was confirmed by the idea that the son of Nun was a per- sonification of Christ (see Justin, Dial. 75; Clem. Al. 183; Didymus, De Trin. 1. 19, Ἰούδας καθολικῶς γράφει, ἅπαξ γὰρ κύριος ᾿Ιησοῦς λαὸν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου σώσας κ.τ.λ.; Jérome, C. ου. 1. 12; Lact. Inst. 4. 17, “Christi figuram gerebat ille Jesus, qui cum primum Auses vocaretur, Moyses futura praesentiens jussit eum Jesum vocari’’). In the ex- planatory note I have stated my reasons for considering that the article before µή did not belong to the original text. Ver. 12. οὗτοί εἶσιν [ot] ἐν ταῖς ἀγάπαις ὑμῶν σπιλάδες συνευωχούµενοι ἀφόβως ἑαυτοὺς ποιµαίνοντε.. The article here is omitted by NK and many inferior MSS. with vg. (but not syrr. or sah. or boh.), and some of the patristic quotations. I agree with Dr. Chase in thinking that it is out of place here, as in ver. 5 above. There is not only the difficulty of construction (ot . . . σπιλάδες), but the very bold assump- tion that the signification of σπιλάδες will be at once apparent. If we omit the article, ἀφόβως should be attached to συνευωχ. as by Ti. In syrr. it is joined with ποιµαίνοντες. Ver. 19. οὗτοί εἶσιν ot ἀποδιορίζοντες, ψυχικοὶ πνεῦμα μὴ ἔχοντες. ἀποδιορίζοντες add. ἑαντούς C vulg. syrr. Om. SABKL 13, ete. Schott, B. Weiss, and Huther-Kiihl suppose the words ψυχικοὶ πνεῦμα μὴ ἔχοντες to be spoken by, or at least to express the feeling of οἱ ἀποδιορίζοντες: “welche Unterscheidungen machen, sc. zwischen Psychikern und Pneumatikern, wobei dann der Verfasser diese Un- terscheidungen in seiner drastischen Weise sofort zu ihren Ungunsten 248 INTRODUCTION umkehrt”. This explanation seems to me to give a better sense than the gloss approved by Spitta, ot τὰ σχίσµατα ποιοῦντες; for one cause of the danger which threatens the Church is that the innovators do not separate themselves openly, but steal in unobserved (παρεισεδύῃσαν, ver. 4), and take part in the love-feasts of the faithful, in which they are like sunken rocks (ver. 12); and, secondly, it is by no means cer- tain that the word ἀποδιορίζω could bear this sense. ἀφορίζω is used in Luke vi. 22 of excommunication by superior authority, which of course would not be applicable here. On the other hand, it seems impossible to get the former sense out of the Greek as it stands. Even if we allowed the possibility of such a harsh construction as to put Ψψυχικοί in inverted commas, as the utterance of the innovators (and should we not then have expected the contrast ψυχικοί, πνευµα- τικοί 2), still we cannot use the same word over again to express Jude’s “drastic”? retort. This difficulty would be removed if we supposed the loss of a line to the following effect after ἀποδιορίζοντες :— ψυχικοὺς Spas (or τοὺς πιστοὺς) λέγοντες, ὄντες αὐτοὶ ψυχικοὶ πνεῦμα μὴ ἔχοντες. The opposition Οἱ ψυχικοί to πνευµατικοί is familiar in the writings of Tertullian after he became a Montanist. The Church is carnal, the sect spiritual. So the Valentinians distinguished their own ad- herents as pneumatici from the psychict who composed the Church. These were also technical terms with the Naassenes and Heracleon (see my notes on James iii. 15), and were probably borrowed by the early heretics from St. Paul, who uses them to distinguish the natural from the heavenly body (1 Cor. xv. 44), and also to express the pre- sence or absence of spiritual insight (1 Cor. ii. 14 f.) ψυχικὸς ἄνθρωπος οὐ δέχεται τὰ τοῦ πνεύματος τοῦ Θεοῦ, pwpia yap αὐτῷ ἐστιν . . . 6 δὲ πνευματικὸς ἀνακρίνει πάντα. The innovators against whom St. Jude writes seem to have been professed followers of St. Paul (like the Marcionites afterwards), abusing the doctrine of Pree Grace which they had learnt from him (ver. 4 τὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ χάριτα µετατιθέντες εἰς ἀσέλγειαν), professing a knowledge of the βάθη τοῦ Θεοῦ (1 Cor. ii. 10), though it was really a knowledge only of τὰ βάθεα τοῦ Σατανᾶ (Apoc. ii. 24), and claiming to be the true δυνατοί and πνευµατικοί, as denying dead works and setting the spirit above the letter. This explains the subsequent misrepresentation of St. Paul as a heresiarch in the Pseudo-Clementine writings. Vv. 22, 23. (Text of Tischendorf and Tregelles) καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐλέγχετε διακρινοµένους, οὓς δὲ σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες, οὓς δὲ ἐλεᾶτε ἐν φόβῳ, μισοῦντες καὶ τὸν ἀπὸ τῆς σαρκὸς ἐσπιλωμένον Χιτῶνα.

Tischendorf makes the matter clearer by giving the consecutive text of versions and quotations as follows: Vulg. Et hos quidem arguite judicatos, illos vero salvate de igne rapientes, aliis autem miseremini in tumore, Ar®. Et quosdam corripite super peccatis eorum, et quor- undam miseremini cum fuerint victi, et quosdam salvate ex igne et liberate eos. Ar?.

Mr. Horner states that vv. 22, 23 are omitted in Sah. He translates Boh. as follows: καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐλέγχετε διακρινοµένους, οὓς δὲ σώζετε ἐκ τοῦ πυρός (al. om. τοῦ), οὓς δὲ ἐλεᾶτε (al. φέρετε) ἐν φόβω. Commentaries of Theophylact and Oecumenius, κἀκείνους δέ, εἰ μὲν ἀποδιΐστανται ὑμῶν--- τοῦτο γὰρ σηµαίνει τὸ διακρίνεσθαι---ἐλέγχετε, τουτέστι Φανεροῦτε τοῖς Tact τὴν ἀσέβειαν αὐτῶν: εἴτε δὲ πρὸς ἴασιν ἀφορῶσι, μὴ ἀπωθεῖσθε, ἀλλὰ τῷ τῆς ἀγάπης ὑμῶν ἐλέῳ προσλαμβάνεσθε, σώζοντες ἐκ τοῦ ἠπειλημένου αὐτοῖς πυρός’ προσλαμβάνεσθε δὲ μετὰ τοῦ ἐλεεῖν αὐτοὺς καὶ μετὰ φόβου. In all these it will be observed that three classes are distinguished as in the text of Tregelles and Tischendorf, and in A, οὓς μὲν ἐλέγχετε διακρινοµένους, οὓς δὲ σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες, οὓς δὲ ἐλεᾶτε ἐν φόβω, and ἐν, οὓς μὲν ἐλεᾶτε διακρινοµένους, οὓς δὲ σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες, οὓς 250 INTRODUCTION δὲ ἐλεᾶτε ἐν φόβω. We should draw the same conclusion from the seeming quotation in Can. Apost. vi. 4 (οὗ µισήσεις πάντα ἄνθρωπον, ἀλλὰ) οὓς μὲν ἐλέγξεις, οὓς δὲ ἐλεήσεις, περὶ ὧν δὲ προσεύξῃ (οὓς δὲ ἀγαπή- σεις ὑπὲρ τὴν ψυχήν σου), which occurs also, with the omission of the cause οὓς δὲ ἐλεήσεις in the Didaché ii. 7. . Two classes only are distinguished in the following: Syrp. Et quosdam de illis quidem ex igne rapite; cum autem resipuerint, miseremint super eis in timore, representing καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζετε, διακρινοµένους δὲ ἐλεᾶτε ἐν φόβω. Syrh. et hos quidem misere- mint resipiscentes, hos autem servate de igne rvapientes in timore, representing καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐλεᾶτε διακρινοµένους, οὓς δὲ σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες ἐν φόβῳ. Clem. (Adumbr.) quosdam autem salvate de igne rapientes, quibusdam vero miseremini in timore,’ representing οὓς δὲ σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες, οὓς δὲ ἐλεᾶτε ἐν φόβω. Clem. Sivom. vi. 773, καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζετε, διακρινοµένους δὲ ἐλεεῖτε, implying that he was acquainted with two different recensions. With these we may compare the texts of B, followed by WH. and B. Weiss, καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐλεᾶτε διακρινοµένους σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες, οὓς δὲ ἐλεᾶτε ἐν φόβω, of C, καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐλέγχετε διακρινοµένους, οὓς δὲ σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες ἐν Φόβω, and of KLP, καὶ οὓς μὲν ἐλεεῖτε διακρινόµενοι, οὓς δὲ ἐν φόβῳ σώζετε ἐκ πυρὸς ἁρπάζοντες. St. Jude’s predilection for triplets, as in vv. 2, 4, 8, in the examples of judgment in vv. 5-7, and of sin in v. 11, is prima facie favourable to the triple division in this passage. Supposing we take A and §& to represent the original, consisting of three members, a b c, we find B complete in a and c, but confused as to b. As it stands, it gives an impossible reading ; since it requires οὓς µέν to be taken as the rela- tive, introducing the subordinate verb ἐλεᾶτε, depending on the prin- cipal verb σώζετε; while οὓς δέ, on the other hand, must be taken as demonstrative. WH suggest that ἐλεᾶτε has crept in from below. Omitting this, we get the sense, “Some who doubt save, snatching them from fire; others compassionate in fear’’. It seems an easier explanation to suppose that ἐλεᾶτε was written in error for ἐλέγχετε and ots omitted in error after διακρινοµένους. The latter phenomenon is exemplified in the readings of Syrp. and Clem. Sir. 773. The texts of C and KLP are complete in a and 3, but insert a phrase from cin b. The most natural explanation here seems to be that the duplication of ἐλεᾶτε in a and c (as in 8) caused the omission of 1The paraphrase continues, id est ut eos qui in ignem cadunt doceatis ut semet ipsos liberent. (It would seem that this clause has got misplaced and should be in- serted after rapientes.) Odientes, inquit, eam, quae carnalis est, maculatam tunicam ; animae videlicet tunica macula (read maculata) est, spivitus concupiscentiis pollutus carnalibus. INTRODUCTION 251 the second ἐλεᾶτε, and therefore of the second οὓς δέ. The reading διακρινόµενοι in KLP was a natural assimilation to the following nominative ἁρπάζοντες, and seemed, to those were not aware of the difference in the meaning of the active and middle of διακρίνω, to supply a very appropriate thought, viz., that discrimination must be used; treatment should differ in different cases. The real difficulty however of the triple division is to arrive at a clear demarcation between the classes alluded to. ‘The triple divi- sion,” says Hort (4p. p. 107), “gives no satisfactory sense ” ; and it certainly has been very diversely interpreted, some holding with Kiihl that the first case is the worst and the last the most hopeful: “ Die dritte Klasse . . . durch helfendes Erbarmen wieder hergestellt wer- den kénnen, mit denen es also nicht so schlimm steht, wie mit denen, welchen gegeniiber nur ἐλέγχειν zu tiben ist, aber auch nicht so schlimm, wie mit denen, die nur durch rasche, zugreifende That zu retten sind’’; while the majority take Reiche’s view of a climax: ‘“a dubi- tantibus minusque depravatis . . . ad insanabiles, quibus opem ferre pro tempore ab ipsorum contumacia prohibemur”. My own view is that Jude does not here touch on the case of the heretical leaders, of whom he has spoken with such severity before. In their present mood they are not subjects of ἔλεος, any more than the Pharisees con- demned by our Lord, as long as they persisted in their hostility to the truth. The admonition here given by St. Jude seems to be the same as that contained in the final verses of the Epistle written by his brother long before: ἐάν τις ἐν ὑμῖν πλανηθῇ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀληθείας καὶ ἐπιστ- ρέψῃ τις αὐτόν, γινώσκετε ὅτι 6 ἐπιστρέψας ἁμαρτωλὸν ἐκ πλάνης ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ σώσει ψυχὴν ἐκ θανάτου. The first class with which the believers are called upon to deal is that of doubters, διακρινόµενοι, men still halting between two opinions (cf. James i. 6), or perhaps we should under- stand it of disputers, as in Jude 9. These they are to reprove and con- vince (cf. John xvi. 8, 9, ἐλέγξει περὶ ἁμαρτίας ὅτι οὐ πιστεύουσιν εἰς ἐμέ). Then follow two classes undistinguished by any special characteristic, whose condition we can only conjecture from the course of action to be pursued respecting them. The second class is evidently in more imminent danger than the one we have already considered, since they are to be saved by immediate energetic action, snatching them from the fire; the third seems to be beyond human help, since the duty of ΄ the believers is limited to trembling compassion, expressing itself no doubt in prayer, but apparently shrinking from personal communica- tion with the terrible infection of evil. We may compare with this St. Paul’s judgment as to the case of incest in the Church of Corinth (1 Cor. v. 5), and the story told about Cerinthus and St. John. i“ my ‘ i dann ie Ny My ae Ms i ΐ Me ΩΜΗ i δν vas ay πι. if iis f |!

Jude a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who have received the divine cal- ling, beloved of the Father, kept safe in Jesus Christ. May mercy, peace and love be richly poured out upon you! I. ᾿Ιησοῦ Χριστοῦ δοῦλος. The same phrase is used by St. James in the In- scription to his epistle, also by St. Paul in Rom. and Phil. In 1 Pet. the phrase used is ἀπόστολος |. X., in 2 Pet. δοῦλος καὶ ἀπόστολος. It is, 1 think,a mistake to translate δοῦλος by the word “ slave,” the modern connotation of which is so different from that of the Greek word (cf. 2 Cor. iv. 5). There is no opposition between δουλεία and ἐλευθερία in. the Christian’s willing service. It only be- comes a δουλεία in the opposed sense, when he ceases to love what is com- manded and feels it as an external yoke. ἀδελφὸς δὲ ᾿Ιακώβου. Cf. Tit. i. 1, Φδοῦλος Θεοῦ, ἀπόστολος δὲ “I. X. See Introduction on the Author. τοῖς ἐν Θεῷ πατρὶ ἠγαπημένοις καὶ ᾿Ιησοῦ Χριστῷ τετηρηµένοις κλητοῖς. On the readings see Introduction on the text. The easier reading of some MSS., ἡγιασμένοις for ἠγαπημένοις, is probably derived from 1 Cor. i. 2, Ἡγιασμένοις ἐν Χ. *l. There is no precise parallel either for ἐν Θεῷ Hy. or for Χριστῷ τετ. The pre- position ἐν is constantly used to express the relation in which believers stand to Christ: they are incorporated in Him as the branches in the vine, as the living stones in the spiritual temple, as the members in the body of which He is the head. So here, ‘‘ beloved as members of Christ, reflecting back his glorious image ’’ would be a natural und easy conception. Lightfoot, commenting on Col. ili. 12, ἐκλεκτοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἅγιοι καὶ ἠγαπημένοι, says that in the N.T. the last word ‘‘ seems to be used always of the objects of God’s love,”’ but it is diffi- cult to see the propriety of the phrase, ‘Brethren beloved by God in God”, Ἠγαπημένοι is used of the objects of man’s love in Clem. Hom. ix. 5, τῶν αὐτοῖς ἠγαπημένων τοὺς τάφους vaocis τιμῶσιν, and the cognate ἀγαπητοί is constantly used in the same sense (as below ver. 3), as well as in the sense of “beloved of God”. If, therefore, we are to retain the reading, I am disposed to interpret it as equivalent to ἀδελφοί, “beloved by us in the Father,” i.¢., ‘‘ be- loved with Φιλαδελφία as children of God,” but I think that Hort is right in considering that ἐν has shifted its place in the text. See his Select Readings, p. 106, where it is suggested that ἐν should be omitted before Θεῷ and inserted before *Inoov, giving the sense “to those who have been beloved by the Father, and who have been kept safe in Jesus from the temptations to which others have succumbed,” ἠγαπημένοις being followed by a dative of the agent, as in Nehem. xii, 26, ἀγαπώμενος TO Θεῷ ἦν. κλητοῖς is here the substantive of which ἠγαπημένοις and τετηρηµένοις are predicated. We find the same use in Apoc. xvii. 14 (νικήσουσιν) ot per’ αὐτοῦ κλητοὶ κ. ἐκλεκτοὶ κ. πιστοί, in St. Paul’s epistles, as in Rom. i. 6, ἐν ots ἐστε καὶ ὑμεῖς, κλητοὶ ᾿Ιησοῦ Χριστοῦ, © Cor. i. 24, κηρύσσομεν Χριστὸν ἐσταυρω- µένον, ᾿Ιουδαίοις μὲν σκάνδαλον ... αὐτοῖς δὲ τοῖς κλητοῖς Χριστὸν Θεοῦ δύναμιν. We have many examples of the Divine calling in the Gospels, as in the case of the Apostles (Matt. iv. 21, Mark i. 20) and in the parables of the Great Supper and the Labourers in the Vineyard. This idea of calling or elec- tion is derived fromthe O.T. See Hort’s n.on I Pet. i. 1 Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐκλεκ- τοῖς: ‘* Two great forms of election are spoken of in the O.T., the choosing of Israel, and the choosing of single 254 IOYAA ΕΠΙΣΤΟΛΗ e— Θεῷ πατρὶ ἠγαπημένοις ] καὶ ᾿Ιησοῦ Χριστῷ τετηρηµένοις κλητοῖς. 2. ἔλεος ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη καὶ ἀγάπη πληθυνθείη. 3. ᾿Αγαπητοί, πᾶσαν σπουδὴν ποιούµενος γράφειν ὑμῖν περὶ τῆς. ηγαπηµενοις AB WN; ηγιασµενοις KLP. Israelites, or bodies of Israelites, to perform certain functions for Israel. . . . The calling and the choosing imply each other, the calling being the outward expression of the antecedent choosing, the act by which it begins to take effect. Both words emphatically mark the pre- sent state of the persons addressed as being due to the freeagency of God.... In Deuteronomy (iv. 37) the choosing, by God is ascribed to His own love of Israel: the ground of it lay in Himself, not in Israel... . As is the election of the ruler or priest within Israel for the sake of Israel, such is the election of Israel for the sake of the whole human race. Such also, still more clearly and emphatically, is the election of the new Israel.”’ For a similar use of the word “‘call” in Isaiah, cf. ch. xlvili. 12, κ. 1.7. The chief distinction between the the ‘‘calling’’ of the old and of the new ‘dispensation is that the former is rather expressive of dignity (‘“‘called by the name of God”’), the latter of invitation ; but the former appears also in the N.T. in such phrases as James ii. 7, τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς, and 1 Pet. ii. Q, ὑμεῖς δὲ γένος ἐκλεκτόν, βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα . . . λαὸς εἰς περιποίησιγ. The reason for St. Jude’s here character- ising the called as beloved and kept, is because he has in his mind others who had been called, but had gone astray and incurred the wrath of God. Ver. 2. For the Salutation see my note on xalpew, James i. 1, and Hort’s excellent note on 1 Pet. i. 2, χάρις... πληθυνθείη. We find ἔλεος and εἰρήνη joined in Gal. vi. 16, and with the addi- tion of χάρις in 1 Tim. i. 2, 2 Tim. i. 2, 2 John 3. The mercy of God is the ground of peace, which is perfected in the feeling of God’s love towards them. The verb πληθυνθείη occurs in the Saluta- tion both of 1 Peter and 2 Peter and in Dan. vi. 25 (in the letter of Darius), εἰρήνη ὑμῖν πληθυνθείη, cf. 1 Thess. iii. 12, ὑμᾶς δὲ 6 κύριος πλεονάσαι Kai πε- ρισσεύσαι TH ἀγάπῃ eis ἀλλήλους. ᾿᾽Αγάπη (=the love of God) occurs also in the final salutation of 2 Cor. ἡ χάρις τ. κυρίου Ἰησοῦ καὶ ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ, and in Eph. εἰρήνη τοῖς ἀξελφοῖς καὶ ἀγάπη μετὰ πίστεως ἀπὸ Θεοῦ πατρὸς καὶ Κυρίου Ἰ. X. Cf. 1 John iii. 1, ἴδετε ToTaTHv ἀγάπην δέδωκεν ἡμῖν 6 πατὴρ ἵνα τέκνα Θεοῦ κληθῶμεν, where West- cott’s n. is “The Divine love is infused into. them, so that it is their own, and be- comes in them the source of a divine life (Rom. xii, το). In virtue of this gift they are inspired with a love which is like the love of God, and by this they truly claim the title of children of God as partakers in His nature, 1 John iv. 7, 1g.” The same salutation is used in the letter of the Smyrnaeans (ο. 156 A.D.) giving an account of the martyrdom of Polycarp, ἔλεος καὶ εἰρήνη καὶ ἀγάπη Θεοῦ πατρὸς καὶ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰ. Χ. πλη- θυνθείη. The thought of ἔλεος and ἀγάπη recurs again in ver. 21. Vv. 3, 4.—Reasons for Writing. He had been intending to write to them on that which is the common interest of all Christians, salvation through Christ, but was compelled to abandon his intention by news which had reached him of a special danger* threatening the Gospel _ once for alldelivered tothe Church. His duty now was to stir up the faithful to defend their faith against insidious as- saults, long ago foretold in ancient pro- phecy, of impious men who should change the doctrine of God’s free grace into an excuse for licentiousness, and deny the only Master and our Lord Jesus Christ. Ver. 3. ἀγαπητοί occurs in vv. 17 and 20, also in 2 Pet. iii. 1, 8, 14, 17, 1 Pet. ii. II, iv. 12 and James. It is common in the Epistles of John and of Paul, sometimes with pov attached, as in 1 Cor. x. 14, Phil. ii. 12, and is often joined to ἀδελφοί, especially in James. The ἀγάπη of ver. 2 leads on to the ἀγαπητοί here. They are themselves ἀγαπητοί because the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts. πᾶσαν σπουδὴν ποιούµενς.

Jude was busy on another subject, when he received the news of a fresh danger to the Church, which he felt it his duty to meet at once. Whether he lived to carry out his earlier design, and whether it was of the nature of a treatise or of an epistle, we know not. It is noteworthy that there is a similar allusion in 2 Peter iii. 1 to an earlier letter now lost. Com- pare Barn. iv. 9, πολλὰ δὲ θέλων γράφειν 2 + = γράφειν ἐσπούδασα. κοινῆς σωτηρίας. Cf.

Bede explains as follows: ‘omnium electorum communis est salus, fides, et dilectio Christi”. Jude puts on one side the address he was pre- paring on the main principles of Chris- tianity (probably we may take vv. 20 and 21 as a sample of what this would have been) and turns to the special evil which was then threatening the Church.

The aor. γράψαι, contrasted with the preceding pres. γράφειν, im- plies that the new epistle had to be writ- ten at once and could not be prepared for at leisure, like the one he had pre- viously contemplated. It was no wel- come task: ‘necessity was laid upon him”. ἐπαγωνίζεσθαι τῇ ἅπαξ παραδοθείσῃ τοῖς ἁγίοις πίστει. '' Το contend for the faith,’ almost equivalent το the ἀγώνισαι περὶ τὴς ἀληθείας in Sir. iv. 28, see 1 Tim. vi. 12, ἀγωνίζου τὸν καλὸν ἀγῶνα τῆς πίστεως, and εἰς ὃ κοπιῶ ἀγωνιζόμε- vos, Col. i. 29. We may compare étra- µύνειν, ἐπαναπαύειν νόµῳ, Rom. ii. 17 and Clem. Strom. iii., p. 553, ἐπαγωνιζό- µενος τῇ ἀθέῳ δόξῃ. It is possible (as is shown by the following examples) for spiritual blessings, once given, to be lost, unless we use every effort to maintain them. The redemption from Egypt was a fact, as baptism into the name of Christ is a fact, but, unless it is borne in mind and acted upon, the fact loses its efficacy. τῇ ἅπαξ παραδοθείσῃ τοῖς ἁγίοις πίστει. The word πίστις here is not used in its primary sense of a subjective feeling of trust or belief, but in the secondary sense of the thing believed, the Truth or the Gospel, as in ver. 20 below, Gal. i. 23, 6 διώκων ἡμᾶς ποτε viv εὐαγγελίζεται τὴν πίστιν ἤν ποτε ἐπόρθει, also Gal. iii. 23, Phil. i. 27, συναθλοῦντες τῇ πίστει τοῦ εὐαγγελίου, where see Lightfoot, Acts vi. 7. In the same way ἐλπίς is used in a concrete sense for the object or ground of hope (as in Col. i. 5, τὴν ἐλπίδα τὴν ἀποκειμένην ἡμῖν, r Tim. i 1, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τῆς ἐλπίδος ἡμῶν, Tit. ii. 13, προσδεχόµενοι τὴν µακαρίαν ἐλπίδα), and φόβος for the object of fear, Rom. xiii. 3, 1 Pet. iii. 14. ἅπαξ. Used here in its classical sense ‘once for all,’ as below ver. 5, and in Heb. vi. 4, τοὺς ἅπαξ dwticbévras, ib. 1X.) ο 27, X12, © Εεῖ ii. 18. This ex- cludes the novelties of the Libertines, of. Gal. 1.09. The later sense ‘“‘ on one occasion ”’ is found in 2 Cor. xi. 25, ἅπαξ ἐλιθάσθην, 1 Thess. ii. 18, καὶ ἅπαξ καὶ δὶς ἠθελήσαμεν ἐλθεῖν. παραδοθείσῃ. Cf. Philo M. i. 387, πιστεύει τοῖς ἅπαξ παραδοθεῖσι. The Christian tradition is constantly referred to by the Fathers, as by Clem. Al. Str. vii. where we read of η ἀληθὴς παράδοσις (ρ. 845), ἤ ἐκκλησιαστικὴ π. (p. 8go), ἡ θεία π. (p. 896), ἡ πάντων τῶν ἀποστόλων π. (Ρ. goo), ai τοῦ Χριστοῦ π. (p. gor), and even in; the Ν.Τ. as in 1 Cor. xi. 2, κάθως παρέδωκα ὑμῖν τὰς παραδόσεις κατέχετε, 2 Thess. ii. 15, 1 Tim. vi. 20, τὴν παραθήκην pvAakov. For an account of the gradual-formation of the Creed, see A. E. Burn’s Introduc- tion to the Creeds, ch. ii., 1899, and com- pare the comment in my larger edition, ° p. 6r {. τοῖς ἁγίοις. Used generally of Chris- tians who were consecrated and called to be holy, as in 1 Cor. 1. 2, Phil. i. 1, where see Lightfoot. The word contains an appeal to the brethren to stand fast against the teaching and practice of the Libertines.

The aor. is here used with the perfect force, as in ver. ΤΙ ἐπορεύθησαν, etc. cf. Blass, Gr. p. 199, my edition of St. James, p. ccii., and Dr. Weymouth there cited. The verb occurs in Demades 178, ἄδικος παρεισδύνων λόγος εἰς τὰς τῶν δικαστῶν γνώµας οὐκ ἐᾷ συνορᾶν τὴν ἀλήθειαν, Clem.

ΛΜ. p. 216 B, τὰ ἀρχαῖα νόμιμα ἐκλυόμενα ἑώρα, ἄλλα δὲ παρεισδυόµενα µοχθηρά, other examples in Wetst. The noun παρείσδυσις occurs in Barn. il. 1Ο, iv. 9, ἀντιστῶμεν ἵνα μὴ σχῇ παρείσδυσιν 6 µέλας, Clem. Al. p. 189, ἀκροσφαλὴς ἡ τοῦ οἴνου παρείσδυσις. Similar compounds are παρεισφέρω in 2 Pet. i. 5, παρεισάγω in 2 Pet. ii. 1, παρείσακτος in Gal. ii. 4, διὰ τοὺς παρεισάκτους wWevdadéAdovs οἵτινες παρεισῆλθον κατασκοπῆσαι τὴν ἐλεν- θερίαν ὑμῶν, Rom. vy. 20, 2 Macc. ΠΠ. 1 παρεισπορευόµενοι λεληθότως εἰς τὰς κώμας, SO παρεισέρπω, παρεισπέµπω, παρεισπίπτω. The earliest prophecy of such seducers comes from the lips of Jesus Himself, Matt. vii. 15, προσέχετε ἀπὸ τῶν ψευδοπροφητῶν, οἵτινες ἔρ- Χονται πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐν ἐνδύμασι προβάτων, ἔσωθεν δέ εἰσι λύκοι ἅρπαγες, cf. Acts XxX. 29, 30, and Introduction on the Early Heresies in the larger edition. οἱ πάλαι προγεγραµµένοι εἰς τοῦτο τὸ κρίμα. ‘Designated of old for this judgment.” Cf. 2 Pet. ii. 3, οἷς τὸ κρίµα ἔκπαλαι οὐκ ἀργει. The word πάλαι precludes the supposition that the second epistle of Peter can be referred to.* The allusion is to the book of Enoch quoted in vv. I4, 15. In νετ. 18 below the same warning is said to have been given by the Apostles. The phrase ot προγ. is in apposition to τινες ἄνθρωποι, cf. Gal. i. 7 with Lightfoot’s n., Luke xvili. 9, εἶπεν δὲ πρός τινας τοὺς πεποιθότας ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτοῖς. For προγ., cf. Rom. xv. 4, ὅσα yap προεγράφη εἰς τὴν ἡμετέραν διδασκαλίαν ἐγράφη. The word is in- tended to show that they are already doomed to punishment as enemies of God. As such they are to be shunned by the faithful, but not to be feared, because, dangerous as they may seem, they cannot alter the Divine purpose. Dr. Chase compares Hort’s interesting note on 1 Peter ii. 8, eis ὃ καὶ ἐτέθησαν. By ‘“‘this” Spitta understands “that judgment which I am now about to de- clare,” i.e., the condemnation contained in the word ἀσεβεῖς used by some ancient writer. Zahn however remarks that οὗτος usually refers to what precedes, and he would take τοῦτο here (with Hof- mann) as referring to παρεισεδύησαν. Better than this logical reference to some preceding or succeeding word is, I think, Bengel’s explanation “ the now impend- ing judgment,” Afostolo iam quast cer- nente penam. ἀσεβεῖς. This word may be almost said to give the keynote to the Epistle (cf. vv. 15, 18) as it does to the Book of Enoch. τὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν χάριτα µετα- τιθέντες εἰς ἀσέλγειαν. With this we may compare 1 Peter ii. 16, μὴ ὡς ἐπικάλυμμα ἔχοντες τὴς κακίας τὴν ἐλευθερίαν, 2 Peter ii. 19, ἐλευθερίαν ἐπαγγελλόμενοι, iii. 16, δυσνόητά τινα, ἃ οἱ ἀμαθεῖς στρεβλοῦσιν πρὸς τὴν ἰδίαν αὐτῶν ἀπώλειαν, Rom. iii. 1, 2, 5-8 (If man is justified by free grace and not by works, then works are unnecessary), ib. Vi. τ, το απ. 2x.) © Com το ρα τ. John viii. 32-36, Gal. v. 13, ἡμεῖς ἐπ᾽ ἐλευθερίᾳ ἐκλήθητε" µόνον μὴ τὴν * Zahn, it is true, following Schott and others, argues in favour of this reference, holding that πάλαι may be equivalent to “lately”; and the word is of course very elastic in meaning; but unless the contrast makes it clear that the reference is to a recent past, I think we are bound to assign to the word its usual force, especially here, where it stands first, giving the tone as it were to what follows, snd is further confirmed and explained by ἕβδομος ἀπὸ Αδάμ in ver. 14. ά ο ΙΟΥΔΑ ΕΠΙΣΤΟΛΗ 257 τες εἰς ἀσέλγειαν καὶ τὸν µόνον δεσπότην 1 καὶ κύριον ἡμῶν ᾿Ιησοῦν 1 δεσποτην] add. θεον KLP, syrr. +. ἐλευθερίαν eis ἀφορμὴν τῇ σαρκί. For µετατιθέντες see Gal. i. 6, for ἀσέλγειαν 2 Peter ii. 2, πολλοὶ ἐξακολουθήσουσιν αὐτῶν ταῖς ἀσελγείαις, ib. ii. 7, 18, 1 Peter iv. 3, and Lightfoot on Gal. ν. 19, ‘‘A man may be ἀκάθαρτος and hide his sin: he does not become ἀσελγής until he shocks public decency. In classical Greek the word ἀσέλγεια generally signifies insolence or violence towards another. . . . In the later lang- uage the prominent idea is sensuality . . . Cf. Polyb. xxxvii. 2, πολλὴ δέ τις ἀσέλγεια καὶ περὶ τὸς σωματικὰς ἐπιθυμίας αὐτῷ συνεξηκολούθε.. Thus it has much the same range of meaning as UBpis”. On the meaning of χάρις see Robinson, Ephes. p. 221 f. The form χάριν is used elsewhere in the N.T., except in Acts xxiv. 27. τὸν µόνον δεσπότην καὶ κύριον ἡμῶν ᾿Ιησοῦν Χριστὸν ἀρνούμενοι. So 2 Peter ii. I, τὸν ἀγοράσαντα αὐτοὺς δεσπότην ἀρνούμενοι. On the denial of God and Christ see 1 John ii. 22, οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ ἀντίχριστος, 6 ἀρνούμενος τὸν πατέρα καὶ Tov vidv, Tit. i. 16, Θεὸν ὁμολογοῦσιν εἰδέναι, τοῖς δὲ ἔργοις ἀρνοῦνται βδελυκ- τοὶ ὄντες καὶ ἀπειθεῖς καὶ πρὸς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἀδόκιμοι, Matt. x. 33, ὅστιςᾶν ἀρνήσηταί µε ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ἀρνήσομαι κἀγὼ αὐτὸν ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ πατρός pov, ib. xxvi. 70 (Peter’s denial). Such denial is one of the sins noticed in the book of Enoch, Xxxvili. 2: “ When the Righteous One shall appear ... where will be the dwelling of the sinners and where the resting-place of those who have denied the Lord of Spirits?’ Ib. ΧΙ. 2, xlv. 2, xlvi. 7, xlviii. το: “* They will fall and not rise again . . . for they have denied the Lord of Spirits and His Anointed ”. Two questions have been raised as to the meaning of the text, (1) is τ. µόνον δεσπότην to be understood of the Son, (2) what is the force of dpveto@ar? The objection to understanding δεσπότης of our Lord is that in every other passage in the N.T., where δεσπότης occurs, except in 2 Peter ii, 1 (on which see n.), it is spoken of God the Father; that, this being the case, it is difficult to under- stand how Christ can be called τὸν µόνον δεσπότην. It seems to me a forced ex- planation to say that the phrase µόνος δεσπότης has reference only to other earthly masters. No Jew could use it in this connexion without thinking of the one Master in heaven. Again pévos is elsewhere used of the Father only, as in John v. 44, τὴν δόξαν τὴν παρὰ τοῦ µόνου Θεοῦ οὐ Γητεῖτε, xvii. 3, ἵνα γινώσκωσίν σε τὸν µόνον ἀληθινὸν Θεον Rom. xvi. 27, µόνῳ σόφῳ Θεῷ διὰ ᾿Ιησοῦ Χριστοῦ, 1 Tim. i. 17, τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν αἰώνων. .. µόνῳ Θεῷ τιμὴ κ. δόξα, ib. vi. 15, 16, ὅ µακάριος κ. μόνος δυνάστης ὃ µόνος ἔχων ἀθανασίαν, and by Jude himself, below 25, µόνῳ Θεῷ σωτῆρι ἡμῶν διὰ Ἰ. X., τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν, δόξα. Wetst. quotes several passages in which Josephus speaks of God as 6 µόνος δεσπότης. On the other hand, the phrase, so taken, seems to contradict the general rule that, where two nouns, denoting attributes, are joined by καί, if the article is prefixed to the first noun only, the second noun will then be an attribute of the same subject. In the present case, however, the second noun (κύριον) belongs to the class of words which may stand without the article, see Winer, pp. 147-163. A similar doubtful case is found in Tit. ii. 13, προσδεχόµενοι τὴν µακαρίαν ἐλπίδα καὶ ἐπιφάνειαν τῆς δόξης τοῦ μεγάλου Θεοῦ καὶ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν Χ. Ἰ. ὃς ἔδωκεν ἑαυτὸν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἵνα λυτρώσηται ἡμᾶς, where also I should take τοῦ μεγάλου Θεοῦ to refer to the Father. Other examples of the same kind are Eph. v. 5, οὐκ ἔχει KAnpovopiav ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Χριστοῦ καὶ Θεοῦ (where Alf. notes ‘‘ We cannot safely say here that the same Person is intended by X. κ.

See Introduction on Early Heresies in the large edition. Vv. 5-13. Illustrations of Sin and Fudgment Derived from History and from Nature. The judgment impending over these men is borne witness to by well-known facts of the past, and may be illustrated from the phenomena of nature. God showed His mercy in delivering the Israelites from Egypt, but that was no guarantee against their destruction in the wilderness when they again sinned by unbelief. The angels were blessed beyond all other creatures, but when they proved unfaithful to their trust they were imprisoned in darkness, awaiting there the judgment of the great day. The men of Sodom (lived in aland of great fer- tility, they had received some knowledge of God through the presence and teaching of Lot, they had been lately rescued from captivity by Abraham, yet they) followed the sinful example of the angels, and their land is still a prey to the fire, bear- ing witness to the eternal punishment of sin. In spite of these warnings the heretics, who are now finding their way into the Church, persist in their wild hallucinations, giving themselves up to the lusts of the flesh, despising authority, and railing at angelic dignities. They might have been taught better by the example of the archangel Michael, of whom we are told that, when disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, he uttered no word of railing, but made his appeal to God. These men however rail at that which is beyond their know- ledge, while they surrender themselves like brute beasts to the guidance of their appetites, and thus bring about their own destruction, following in the wake of impious Cain, of covetous Balaam, and rebellious Korah. When they take part in your love-feasts they cause the shipwreck of the weak by their wanton- ness and irreverence. In greatness of profession and smallness of performance they resemble clouds driven by the wind which give no rain; or trees in autumn on which one looks in vain for fruit, and which are only useful for fuel. By their confident speaking and brazen assurance they seem to carry all before them; yet like the waves bursting on the shore, the deposit they leave is only their own shame. Or we might compare them to meteors which shine for a moment and are then extinguished for ever. Ver. 5. ὑπομνῆσαι δὲ ὑμᾶς βούλομαι, εἰδότας ὑμᾶς πάντα. Cf. 2 Pet. i. 12, διὸ µελλήσω ὑμᾶς ἀεὶ ὑπομιμνήσκειν καίπερ εἰδότας, 10. i. 13, διεγείρειν ὑμᾶς ἐν ὑπομνήσει, 7b. iii. 1, διεγείρω ὑμῶν ἐν ὑπομνήσει τὴν εἰλικρινῆ διάνοιαν, Rom. XV. 14, πέπεισµαι δὲ ὅτι καὶ αὐτοὶ µεστοί ἐστε ἀγαθωσύνης, πεπληρωμένοι πάσης τῆς γνώσεως . . . τολµηροτέρως δὲ ἔγ- ραψα ὑμῖνιάπὸ µέρους ὡς ἐπαναμιμνήσκων tpas. The word εἰδότας justifies ὑπο- μνῆσαι: they only need to be reminded of truths already known, so that it is un- necessary to write at length. The re- peated ὑμᾶς contrasts the readers with the libertines of the former verse. The words in themselves might be taken ironically of persons professing (like the Corinthians) to “ know all things,’’ but * On the readings see Introduction. oy ΙΟΥΔΑ EMLZTOAH "ο. pov [τοὺς] μὴ πιστεύσαντας ἀπώλεσεν, 6. ἀγγέλους τε τοὺς μὴ τηρήσαντας τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἀρχὴν ἀλλὰ ἀπολιπόντας τὸ ἴδιον οἰκητή- the broad distinction maintained through- out the epistle between ὑμεῖς and οὗτοι (the Libertines) forbids such an inter- pretation. If we read ἅπαξ πάντα with some MSS., it suggests something of anxiety and upbraiding, which may be compared with the tone of St. Paul in writing to the Galatians. See, however, the following note for the position of ἅπαξ. Instead of πάντα some MSS. have τοῦτο. The former finds some sup- port in Enoch 1. 2, “I heard everything from the angels,’’ xxv. 2, ‘‘I should like to know about everything,” Secrets of En. xl. 1, 2, ‘I know all things from the lips of the Lord. . . I know all things and have written all things in the books,”’ Ixi. 2 (quoted by Chase in Dict. of the Bible). It should probably be under- stood of all that follows, including the historical allusions, implying that those addressed were familiar not only with the O.T. but with rabbinical traditions: so Estius “ omnia de quibus volo vos com- monere”’. Bede’s note is ‘‘ omnia vide- licet arcana fidei scientes et non opus habentes recentia quasi sanctiora a novis audire magistris’’. In what follows he takes ἅπαξ with σώσας, “ita clamantes ad se de afflictione Aegyptia primo sal- vavit humiles, ut secundo murmurantes ‘contra se in eremo prosterneret superbos. . . - Meminerimus illum sic per aquas baptismi salvare credentes, ut etiam post baptismum humilem in nobis requirat vitam.”’ ὅτι Κύριος, ἅπαξ λαὸν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου σώσας, τὸ δεύτερον [τοὺς] μὴ πιστεύσαν- τας ἀπώλεσεν.] For text, see Introduc- tion on Readings. Clement in his Adumbrationes gives the paraphrase ‘*Quoniam Dominus Deus semel popu- lum de terra Aegypti liberans deinceps €os qui non crediderunt perdidit”’. τὸ δεύτερον has given rise to much discussion. According to the reading I have adopted, it contrasts the preceding saving with the following destruction. The deliverance from Egypt was the creation of a people once for all, but yet it was followed by the destruction of the unbelieving portion of the people, 2.6. by all but Caleb and Joshua (Num. xiv. 27, 37). So in 1 Cor. x. we have the privileges of Israel allowed, and yet all was in vain because of their unbelief. There seems less force in the connection of ἅπαξ with "σι. Exod. i004, ἵνα, εἰδότας: ἤδη would have been more suitable. For the opposition to τὸ δεύτερον, cf. Heb. ix. 28, 6 Χριστὸς ἅπαξ προσενεχθεὶς εἰς τὸ πολλῶν ἀνενεγκεῖν ἁμαρτίας ἐκ δευτέρου χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας ὀφθήσεται, Theoph. Avtol. ii. 26, ἵνα τὸ μὲν ἅπαξ ᾖ πεπληρωμένον ὅτε ἐτέθη, τὸ δὲ δεύτερον µέλλῃ πληροῦσθαι μετὰ τὴν . . + kptow, Liban. af. Wetst. ἐμοὶ δὲ ἅπαξ ἀρκεῖ γέλωτα ὀφλεῖν, δεύτερον δὲ οὐκέτι. I am inclined to think that the article before µή is an intrusion, as it seems to be before ἐν in νετ. 12. Omitting it, we can take δεύτερον with μὴ πιστεύσαντας, getting the sense: ‘‘In the 1st case of unbelief (in Egypt) * salvation followed; in the 2nd (in the wilderness) destruc- tion,” lit. “when they, a second time failed to believe, He destroyed them”’. If this was the original reading, it is easy to understand the insertion of τούς as facilitating the plural construc- tion after λαόν. We may compare the solemn utterance in Heb, x. 26, ἑκουσίως ἁμαρτανόντων ἡμῶν μετὰ τὸ λαβεῖν τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν τῆς ἀληθείας οὐκ ἔτι περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν ἀπολείπεται θυσία, and the belief, apparently based upon it, in the early Church as to sin after baptism.

Article: Joomla random lack of access permission
When my user tries to edit an article in frontend, he gets "403 - you don't have permission to access(#some id of article)" and when he goes back in browser and tries again usually he can get access - sometimes he need to go back and try again few times. Now this is not happening all the time. I can even recreate this by adding user to different access group and after this trying to access some articles. Then I get 403 blabla, but after few tries I can access the articles editor.
What causes this? Is this because of some cache? Joomla cache is turned off, Apache cache is on. Maybe this is connected with my other stack question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35009053/random-redirect-301-only-in-firefox or could this be caused by rare packet drops?
Also I wanted to post this on official Joomla forum but my ip at work is banned on that forum. I really appreciate any help.
I also posted this on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35031929/joomla-random-lack-of-permission-to-access
Sincerely,
Thomas

You shouldn't post your question on multiple sites (ie cross posting). See also this answer about cross postings on stackexchange: http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/64069

Well, thank You for such info - won't happen again, but as I can see there is planty of people who can point what I did wrong with my question but almost none who can say something useful about actual question... :(

Try it with turned off Apache cache. You're already guessing that it's the cache and that would be my first guess too :-)

Can you replicate the issue on a different environment, i.e locally? Have you installed any cache/seo 3rd party components or plugins recently? Check log files (Joomla and Server)?

that will be first thing I'll do tomorrow @johnny_s :) checking if same thing is happening on my pc on xampp :)

@fruppel I will make my server Administrator to turn off that cache :D and we will see what happens :)

I got a similar issue. Maybe my solution will help you.
I was not able to edit a second time my article and I was also receiving this message : You are not permitted to use that link to directly access that page (#article-id). The error was not appearing when my browser extension « Cache Killer » was activated and the same thing was going on with the mode debug. It could be a suitable solution for me, but not for my clients...
Take a look to your .htaccess file, if your site is not the primary one you should take a look to both of your .htaccess. Ex : home/mysite/mytestsite the .htacess of « mysite » will overrule the .htaccess of « mytestsite »
Search for : expiresdefault or ExpiresByType and comment it with a # and don't forget to clean your browser’s cache.
For my part it was :
ExpiresDefault "now plus 1 hour" 

that I comment :
# ExpiresDefault "now plus 1 hour"

Clean your browser’s cache and that it.
I hope that my solution will help.

Hello @jean I had it already done that way so this isn't it, but thank You for suggestion. :)

It well could be a cache problem, Joomla by default does not cache pages when logged in precisely because of such issues.
Mainly adding an answer to note that Apache can be set to cache only specific extensions, so it should be set to cache only extensions for images, scripts, and fonts. This will still occasionally cause issues and will not add performance that much since browsers will usually just check if the file has changed which with HTTP/1.1 is reasonably fast. But it will reduce server load which your administrator will like.
Also, is your Joomla set to give pages .html extension? Your server might be set to cache static web pages and recognize such by the .html extension. That might be the actual reason for the issue, in which case you can fix it by changing a Joomla setting, without bothering an administrator at all.

Hello @Ville, my Joomla isn't set to add .html extension. Do I understand correctly that Apache cache should be set in Apache config, yes?

Please test this Pull Request/Patch:
https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/9035

Can't do this today. I'll check back after trying that patch. Also could this be guilty of random 301 redirects (noticed only in Firefox browser)? Thx @Phil

saddly it didn't help :( I can't wrap my mind around it :/

Do you mean you could not work out how to apply the patch? or after applying the patch you still had issues?

after applying the patch I still have issues :(

Article: React: how to pass / populate specific data into a component?
I want to build an easily maintainable and consistent layout component for team member biographies that are spread across multiple individual pages such as:
JohnDoe.JS
JaneDoe.Js
JonathanDoe.Js

I want to map a specific set of data onto a prebuild component, that is then placed on the individual pages.
John would receive the dataset with the ID of '1', Jane with the ID of '2.
This is the data to be passed into the component:
      {
    id: '1',  
    link: 'john-doe',
    name: 'John Doe',
    alt: 'John Doe',
    title: 'Managing Director',
    bio: 'works with retail and consumer-goods companies to guide growth, commercial and operational transformations'}
  },

  {
    id: '2',  
    link: 'jane-doe',
    name: 'Jane Doe',
    alt: 'Jane Doe',
    title: 'Operations Director',
    bio: 'works with retail and consumer-goods companies to guide growth, commercial and operational transformations'},

This is the reusable component called TeamBio.js:
<div className="flex flex-wrap">

    
  <div className="w-full md:w-1/2 h-screen overflow-hidden order-last lg:order-first md:order-first">      
  <div className="flex h-screen">
  <div class="m-auto max-w-3xl px-5">

    {TeamData.map((item, index) => {
      return (
          <div>
            <h1 className="text-3xl xs:text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-5xl xl:text-6xl mb-5">{item.name}</h1>
            <p className="text-xl leading-10 uppercase mb-5 text-gray-700">{item.title}</p>
            <p className="text-xl leading-10 mb-5">{item.bio}</p>
            </div>     
      );
    })}

 </div>
 </div>
</div>

  <div className="bg-dsent-green w-full md:w-1/2 h-screen order-first lg:order-last md:order-last">

  <img className=" object-contain h-screen w-full object-none object-bottom" src={require('{item.image}').default} data-aos="fade-up" alt="{item.alt}" />

  </div>
</div>

Once this component is set to populate data using:
 {TeamData.map((item, index) => {,
Every data entry is passed into the component. The data of John, Jane, and Jonathan overlap.
How, or on which level can I apply a filtering of data such as :
 {TeamData.slice(1, 2).map((item, index) => {
to specify the data to be passed into the component?

What do you mean the data for different team members overlaps? As far as I can tell, what you have in TeamBio is correct. Although I'd suggest you take out the content within your .map and create a separate component out of it. But that, again, would raise the question of content overlaping.

Thank you for your question - {TeamData.map((item, index) => {,
leads to every entry of every person of the dataset being passed into the component.

Susumu Ishida Laboratory of Ocular Cell Biology and Visual Science, Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate
School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan Objective: Acrolein is a highly reactive aldehyde that covalently binds to cellular
macromolecules and subsequently modulates cellular function. Our previous study
demonstrated that acrolein induces glial cell migration, a pathological hallmark of diabetic
retinopathy; however, the detailed cellular mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of
this study was to investigate the role of acrolein in retinal glial cell migration by focusing
on rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinases (ROCKs). Methods:
Immunoﬂuorescence staining for ROCK isoforms was performed using
sections of ﬁbrovascular tissue obtained from the eyes of patients with proliferative
diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Rat retinal Müller glial cell line, TR-MUL5, was stimulated
with acrolein and the levels of ROCK1 were evaluated using real-time PCR and
western blotting. Phosphorylation of the myosin-binding subunit of myosin light chain
phosphatase [myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, (MYPT1)] and myosin light chain 2
(MLC2) was assessed. The cell migration rate of TR-MUL5 cells exposed to acrolein
and/or ripasudil, a non-selective ROCK inhibitor, was measured using the Oris cell
migration assay. Edited by:

glial cells in ﬁbrovascular tissues. In TR-MUL5 cells, the mRNA expression level of Rock1,
but not Rock2, was increased following acrolein stimulation. In line with the PCR data,
western blotting showed increase in ROCK1 and cleaved ROCK1 protein in TR-MUL5
cells stimulated with acrolein. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) suppressed acrolein-associated
Rock1 upregulation in TR-MUL5 cells. Acrolein augmented the phosphorylation of
MYPT1 and MLC2 and increased the cell migration rate of TR-MUL5 cells, both of which
were abrogated by ripasudil. *Correspondence:

hydrated via exposure to xylene and graded alcohols, followed
by water. After microwave-based antigen retrieval in 10 mM
citrate buﬀer (pH 6.0), the paraﬃn sections were incubated in
10% normal goat serum (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for 30 min
and then incubated overnight with a primary rabbit monoclonal

1 h at room temperature. Serial sections were incubated with
normal rabbit IgG (Abcam) and normal mouse IgG (Agilent) as
negative controls. Rho-associated
coiled-coil-containing
protein
kinases
(ROCKs) are ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine kinases,
which represent the main eﬀector proteins of the RhoA and
RhoC pathways (11). In humans, ROCKs exist in two isoforms,
i.e., ROCK1 and ROCK2, and these enzymes mainly regulate the
organization of the actin cytoskeleton and associated dynamic
events such as cell contraction and migration (12). Among
more than 30 common ROCK substrates, one of the most
described targets is the myosin phosphatase target subunit
1 (MYPT1) of the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP)
(12). ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of MYPT1 hampers the
catalytic activity of MLCP, in turn resulting in an increase in
myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and subsequent cell
contraction. Previously, it was reported that cigarette smoking
induces barrier dysfunction through the ROCK pathway in
lung microvascular cells, indicating that the acrolein found in
cigarette smoke acts upstream of the ROCK cascade. In addition,
it was demonstrated that ROCK is involved in leukocyte-induced
diabetic retinal endothelial injury (13) and inﬂammatory
microvascular damage (14). Lines of evidence indicate that
ROCK participates particularly in the vascular injury and plays a
role in the pathogenesis of PDR. By contrast, the role of ROCKs
and its associated pathways in retinal glial cells, which also
participate in the progression of DR, remains uninvestigated. For immunocytochemistry, TR-MUL5 cells were seeded into
a 6-well plate with a cover glass and incubated for 24 h. Citation: Fukutsu K, Murata M, Kikuchi K,

detachment in PDR, both of which, without adequate treatment,
eventually result in severe visual impairment. Therefore, the
mechanisms implicated in the development of ﬁbrovascular
tissue are of great signiﬁcance to both clinicians and researchers. Specimens and Materials Fibrovascular tissue consists of small new vessels, extracellular
matrix, and cellular components, such as inﬂammatory cells,
ﬁbroblasts, and glial cells (2). In the eye, there are two basic
types of macroglial cells: Müller glial cells and astrocytes
(3). Of these, Müller glial cells, which provide homeostatic,
metabolic, and functional support to neurons, can become
activated upon pathogenic stimuli (3) and migrate toward the
vitreoretinal surface in the diabetic retina (4). Since activated
Müller glial cells produce a variety of inﬂammatory cytokines
including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (5, 6), it
has been presumed that migrated Müller glial cells are one
of the major participants in the formation of ﬁbrovascular
tissue. We previously investigated the triggers that facilitate the
migratory response of Müller glial cells and found that acrolein,
an unsaturated aldehyde, was one of the causative factors (7). Acrolein is a highly reactive aldehyde distributed in air pollutants
such as cigarette smoke (8) and is associated with the increase in
oxidative stress by reducing the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) in
retinal capillary endothelial cells (9). In Müller glial cells, acrolein
is generated through polyamine metabolism under hypoxic
conditions (10) and accelerates cellular motility by inducing
chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) in an autocrine
fashion (7). Therefore, a growing body of evidence explicitly
suggests that acrolein is one of the trigger stimuli for glial cell
migration in the diabetic retina and therefore, plays a role in the
cell motility mechanism. Fibrovascular tissues surgically removed from patients with PDR
were used for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy. All experiments
were conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration
of Helsinki, following approval from the Institutional Review

activity, phosphorylation of MYPT1 and MLC2 was assessed in
TR-MUL5 cells. As shown in Figure 5, phosphorylation of both
MYPT1 and MLC2 showed increase in TR-MUL5 cells when
stimulated with acrolein, while the total protein levels of MYPT1
and MLC2 were unchanged (Figure 3D). In addition, ripasudil
reduced the acrolein-induced phosphorylation of MYPT1 and
MLC2 (Figure 5). As shown in Figure 6, immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
revealed that acrolein stimulation increased organization of actin
stress ﬁbers in TR-MUL5 cells, whereas actin depolymerization
was observed in the cells treated with ripasudil. The staining
signal of p-MLC2 increased with acrolein stimulation along with
actin ﬁbers, and it was attenuated in the presence of ripasudil. Additionally, ripasudil administration caused cell body shrinkage
in TR-MUL5 cells. FIGURE 5 | Changes in phosphorylation of MYPT1 and MLC2 in TR-MUL5

in response to acrolein exposure (Figure 2B). In addition, the Based on the real-time PCR results, we focused on ROCK1
and examined whether oxidative stress is involved in acrolein-

with PDR. DISCUSSION Notably, the current study exhibited that glial cell migration
induced by acrolein was suppressed by the non-selective
ROCK inhibitor ripasudil. We previously reported that acrolein
induces the production of the pro-inﬂammatory chemokine
CXCL1 and promotes glial cell migration in an autocrine
fashion (7). Enriching the previous ﬁndings, the present study
revealed that ROCKs are involved in acrolein-induced glial
cell migration. Furthermore, given the selective upregulation of
ROCK1 by acrolein, ROCK1 might be the focus of future studies
investigating the mechanism of glial cell migration regulated
by acrolein. y
g
In ROCK proteins, ROCK2 is known as the predominant
form of in ocular tissues (11). Since ROCK1 and ROCK2
exhibit a high degree of sequence homology, both kinases
essentially share not only a wide variety of downstream
substrates but also consequent cellular functions. In fact, the
ROCK isoforms promote the rearrangement of actin-myosin
cytoskeleton organization mediated by phosphorylation of
downstream target proteins, including MYPT1 and MLC2 (21). However, using mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast cells derived from
ROCK1−/−and ROCK2−/−mice, it was elucidated that the
roles of ROCK1 and ROCK2 are not strictly equal; i.e., ROCK1
is involved in destabilizing the actin cytoskeleton by regulating
MLC2 phosphorylation and peripheral actomyosin contraction,
whereas ROCK2 is required for stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton
by regulating coﬁlin phosphorylation (21). Therefore, selective
upregulation of ROCK1 by acrolein, which was demonstrated in
the present study, indicates that acrolein facilitates a transition in
the ROCK system to rearrange actin cytoskeleton and generate
contractile force in Müller glial cells, eventually leading to glial
cell migration. There are several limitations to this study. First, there
was a tendency toward decreasing migration rate in the
acrolein-stimulated glial cells treated with 0.08 µM ripasudil
administration, while identical concentration of ripasudil showed
no inhibitory eﬀect to the phosphorylation of MYPT1 and MLC2. Second, the decrease of Rock2 in retinal glial cells stimulated
with acrolein was intriguing; however, the physiological and/or
pathological signiﬁcance was not studied in the current study. Further investigation is warranted to obtain further mechanistic
insights into non-muscle myosin phosphorylation regulation
through ROCK1 signaling in glial cells. In summary, our data shed light on the regulatory mechanism
of Müller glial cell migration. The current results suggest that
acrolein and its downstream molecule ROCK1 are attractive
molecular targets for the prevention of ﬁbrovascular tissue
formation in PDR. Cigarette smoking is known to produce an estimated 1017
oxidant molecules per puﬀ(22). DISCUSSION ﬁbrovascular tissues of patients with PDR; (2) the unsaturated
aldehyde acrolein increases the production of ROCK1, but not
ROCK2, in cultured Müller glial cells; (3) acrolein enhances
phosphorylation of MYPT1 and MLC2 through the ROCK1
cascade induced by oxidative stress; and (4) ripasudil, a speciﬁc
inhibitor of ROCKs, hampers formation and migration of
stress ﬁbers in Müller glial cells. The current data provide
new insights into the mechanisms of glial cell migration, a Glial cells have increasingly gained attention as one of the
major participants in the progression of DR. While the activation
of glial cells represents some of the earliest events in the
pathogenesis of DR (16), macroglial cells are also implicated in
promoting proliferative changes through VEGF secretion and
internal limiting membrane degradation during the late stage of September 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 717602 Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 8 ROCK1 Blockade in Müller Glial Fukutsu et al. DR (17–19). Hence, elucidating the cellular behaviors of glial cells
in advanced stages of DR contributes to further understanding
of the pathological mechanisms underlying vision-threatening
disease. We previously demonstrated that acrolein-conjugated
proteins are localized in glial cells in the ﬁbrovascular tissues
of PDR patients (20). The current data further demonstrated
that ROCK proteins are ubiquitously present in glial cells in
ﬁbrovascular tissues and that acrolein stimulation increased the
production of ROCK1 in cultured Müller glial cells. Intriguingly,
acrolein stimulation decreased the expression levels of ROCK2. In addition, the expression levels of ROCK-associated molecules
including MYPT1 and MLC2 were not changed by acrolein
stimulation. Whereas, our group previously showed that acrolein
stimulation increases cell viability in cultured retinal glial cells
(7), the current data clearly demonstrated that increase of
ROCK1 protein is not simply attributed to the eﬀect of acrolein
to the cell viability in cultured retinal glial cells. phosphorylation and F-actin bundling, which are characteristics
of stress ﬁber formation, in cultured Müller glial cells. Whereas,
immunoﬂuorescent staining of total MLC2 protein was not
conducted in the present study, western blotting showed no
signiﬁcant change in the expression of total MLC2, indicating
that the increased signal of p-MLC2 along with actin ﬁbers in
the TR-MUL5 cells exposed to acrolein, at least in part, due to
the increase of MLC2 phosphorylation. In addition, since the
possible increase in MLC2 phosphorylation and F-actin bundling
was diminished by ripasudil, the present study demonstrated that
ROCKs are the downstream eﬀectors of acrolein. DISCUSSION Previous studies revealed
that acrolein, a major cytotoxic factor in cigarette smoke
extract, rapidly binds to GSH (23) and induces oxidative
stress in the body (24–26). In line with these ﬁndings and
our previous data (7), the current data also showed that
acrolein reduces intracellular GSH levels in cultured Müller
glial cells. In addition, acrolein-induced Rock1 mRNA synthesis

Article: We do not currently have secured financing for our investments in MSRs and excess servicing spread. Direct leverage on these assets has been difficult to obtain due to the requirement of each Agency that its rights and interest in the MSRs and excess servicing spread remain senior to those of any lender extending credit. As we continue to aggregate MSRs and acquire excess servicing spread, the lack of available financing could place stress on our capital and liquidity positions or require us to forego attractive investment opportunities.
 Our debt financing agreements require us and certain of our subsidiaries to comply with various financial covenants. As of the filing of this Report, these financial covenants include the following:
•
profitability at each of the Company and three of our subsidiaries, our Operating Partnership, PMC and PennyMac Holdings, LLC (f/k/a PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust Holdings I, LLC (“PMH”)), for at least one (1) of the previous two consecutive fiscal quarters, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and at our subsidiary, PMC, for both the prior two (2) calendar quarters and the prior three (3) calendar quarters;
•
a minimum of $40 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents among the Company and/or our subsidiaries; a minimum of $40 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents among our Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries; a minimum of $25 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents between PMC and PMH; and a minimum of $10 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at each of PMC and PMH;
•
a minimum tangible net worth for the Company of $860 million; a minimum tangible net worth for our Operating Partnership of $700 million; a minimum tangible net worth for PMH of $250 million; and a minimum tangible net worth for PMC of $150 million;
•
a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of less than 10:1 for PMC and 5:1 for the Company, our Operating Partnership and PMH; and
•
at least two warehouse or repurchase facilities that finance amounts and assets similar to those being financed under our existing debt financing agreements.
 Although these financial covenants limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur and impact our liquidity through minimum cash reserve requirements, we believe that these covenants currently provide us with sufficient flexibility to successfully operate our business and obtain the financing necessary to achieve that purpose.
PLS is also subject to various financial covenants, both as a borrower under its own financing arrangements and as the servicer under certain of our debt financing agreements. The most significant of these financial covenants currently include the following:
•
positive net income during each calendar quarter;
•
a minimum in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $20 million;
•
a minimum tangible net worth of $90 million; and
•
a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of 10:1.
Our transactions relating to securities sold under agreements to repurchase contain margin call provisions that, upon notice from the applicable lender at its option, require us to transfer cash or additional securities in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit. A margin deficit will generally result from any decline in the market value (as determined by the applicable lender) of the assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, although in some instances we may agree with the lender upon certain thresholds (in dollar amounts or percentages based on the market value of the assets) that must be exceeded before a margin deficit will arise. Upon notice from the applicable lender, we will generally be required to satisfy the margin call on the day of such notice or within one business day thereafter, depending on the timing of the notice.
 The transactions relating to mortgage loans and/or equity interests in special purpose entities holding real property under agreements to repurchase contain margin call provisions that, upon notice from the applicable lender at its option, require us to transfer cash or additional mortgage loans or real property, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit. A margin deficit will generally result from any decline in the market value (as determined by the applicable lender) of the assets subject to an agreement to repurchase. Upon notice from the applicable lender, we will generally be required to satisfy the margin call on the day of such notice or within one business day thereafter, depending on the timing of the notice.
Our Manager continues to explore a variety of additional means of financing our continued growth, including debt financing through bank warehouse lines of credit, additional repurchase agreements, term financing, securitization transactions and additional equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance as to how much additional financing capacity such efforts will produce, what form the financing will take or that such efforts will be successful.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Guarantees
As of December 31, 2013, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or guarantees.
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2013, we had on-balance sheet contractual obligations of $2.1 billion for the financing of assets under agreements to repurchase with maturities between January 2, 2014 and December 18, 2014 as well as forward purchase agreements with maturities between June 16, 2014 and June 30, 2014. We also had contractual obligations of $250.0 million in the Notes.
 As of December 31, 2013, we had contractual obligations to purchase mortgage loans for resale totaling approximately $557.3 million. Of the $557.3 million in commitments to purchase mortgage loans for resale, we recorded IRLCs of $2.5 million on our balance sheet as assets under the caption Derivative assets and $1.3 million as liabilities under the caption Derivative liabilities.
All agreements to repurchase assets that matured between December 31, 2013 and the date of this Report have been renewed, extended or repaid and are described in Note 18-Mortgage Loans Acquired for Sale Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Note 19-Mortgage Loans at Fair Value Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Note 20-Real Estate Acquired in Settlement of Loans Financed Under Agreements to Repurchase in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Payment obligations under these agreements are summarized below:
The amount at risk (the fair value of the assets pledged plus the related margin deposit, less the amount advanced by the counterparty and interest payable) relating to the Company’s assets sold under agreements to repurchase and forward purchase agreements is summarized by counterparty below as of December 31, 2013:
Management Agreement. We are externally managed and advised by our Manager pursuant to a management agreement, which was amended and restated effective February 1, 2013. Our management agreement requires our Manager to oversee our business affairs in conformity with the investment policies that are approved and monitored by our board of trustees. Our Manager is responsible for our day-to-day management and will perform such services and activities related to our assets and operations as may be appropriate.
 Pursuant to our management agreement, our Manager collects a base management fee and may collect a performance incentive fee, both payable quarterly and in arrears. The term of our management agreement expires on February 1, 2017, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
The base management fee is calculated at a defined annualized percentage of “shareholders’ equity.” Our “shareholders’ equity” is defined as the sum of the net proceeds from any issuances of our equity securities since our inception (weighted for the time outstanding during the measurement period); plus our retained earnings at the end of the quarter; less any amount that we pay for repurchases of our common shares (weighted for the time held during the measurement period); and excluding one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges after discussions between our Manager and our independent trustees and approval by a majority of our independent trustees.
Pursuant to our management agreement, the base management fee is equal to the sum of (i) 1.5% per annum of shareholders’ equity up to $2 billion, (ii) 1.375% per annum of shareholders’ equity in excess of $2 billion and up to $5 billion, and (iii) 1.25% per annum of shareholders’ equity in excess of $5 billion. The base management fee is paid in cash.
 The performance incentive fee is calculated at a defined annualized percentage of the amount by which “net income,” on a rolling four-quarter basis and before deducting the incentive fee, exceeds certain levels of return on “equity.” For the purpose of determining the amount of the performance incentive fee, “net income” is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP and certain other non-cash charges determined after discussions between our Manager and our independent trustees and approval by a majority of our independent trustees. For this purpose, “equity” is the weighted average of the issue price per common share of all of our public offerings, multiplied by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (including restricted share units) in the four-quarter period.
The performance incentive fee is calculated quarterly and escalates as net income (stated as a percentage of return on equity) increases over certain thresholds. On each calculation date, the threshold amounts represent a stated return on equity, plus or minus a “high watermark” adjustment. The performance fee payable for any quarter is equal to: (a) 10% of the amount by which net income for the quarter exceeds (i) an 8% return on equity plus the high watermark, up to (ii) a 12% return on equity; plus (b) 15% of the amount by which net income for the quarter exceeds (i) a 12% return on equity plus the high watermark, up to (ii) a 16% return on equity; plus (c) 20% of the amount by which net income for the quarter exceeds a 16% return on equity plus the high watermark.
 The “high watermark” is the quarterly adjustment that reflects the amount by which the net income (stated as a percentage of return on equity) in that quarter exceeds or falls short of the lesser of 8% and the Fannie Mae MBS Yield (the target yield) for such quarter. The “high watermark” starts at zero and is adjusted quarterly. If the net income is lower than the target yield, the high watermark is increased by the difference. If the net income is higher than the target yield, the high watermark is reduced by the difference. Each time a performance incentive fee is earned, the high watermark returns to zero. As a result, the threshold amounts required for our Manager to earn a performance incentive fee are adjusted cumulatively based on the performance of our net income over (or under) the target yield, until the net income in excess of the target yield exceeds the then-current cumulative high watermark amount, and a performance incentive fee is earned. The performance incentive fee may be paid in cash or in our common shares (subject to a limit of no more than 50% paid in common shares), at our option.
 Under our management agreement, our Manager is entitled to reimbursement of its organizational and operating expenses, including third-party expenses, incurred on our behalf. Our Manager may also be entitled to a termination fee under certain circumstances. Specifically, the termination fee is payable for (1) our termination of our management agreement without cause, (2) our Manager’s termination of our management agreement upon a default by us in the performance of any material term of the agreement that has continued uncured for a period of 30 days after receipt of written notice thereof or (3) our Manager’s termination of the agreement after the termination by us without cause (excluding a non-renewal) of our MBWS agreement, our MSR recapture agreement, or our servicing agreement (each as described and/or defined below). The termination fee is equal to three times the sum of (a) the average annual base management fee and (b) the average annual (or, if the period is less than 24 months, annualized) performance incentive fee, in each case earned by our Manager during the 24-month period before termination.
Our management agreement also provides that, prior to the undertaking by our Manager or its affiliates of any new investment opportunity or any other business opportunity requiring a source of capital with respect to which our Manager or its affiliates will earn a management, advisory, consulting or similar fee, our Manager shall present to us such new opportunity and the material terms on which our Manager proposes to provide services to us before pursuing such opportunity with third parties.
 Servicing Agreement. We have entered into a servicing agreement with our Servicer pursuant to which our Servicer provides servicing for our portfolio of residential mortgage loans. The loan servicing provided by our Servicer includes collecting principal, interest and escrow account payments, if any, with respect to mortgage loans, as well as managing loss mitigation, which may include, among other things, collection activities, loan workouts, modifications, foreclosures and short sales. Our Servicer also engages in certain loan origination activities that include refinancing mortgage loans and financings that facilitate sales of real estate owned properties, or REOs. The term of our servicing agreement, as amended, expires on February 1, 2017, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
The base servicing fees for distressed whole loans are calculated based on a monthly per-loan dollar amount, with the actual dollar amount for each loan based on the delinquency, bankruptcy and/or foreclosure status of such loan or the related underlying real estate. Presently, the base servicing fees for distressed whole loans range from $30 per month for current loans up to $125 per month for loans that are severely delinquent and in foreclosure.
 The base servicing fees for loans subserviced by our Servicer on our behalf are also calculated through a monthly per-loan dollar amount, with the actual dollar amount for each loan based on whether the mortgage loan is a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loan. The base servicing fees for loans subserviced on our behalf are $7.50 per month for fixed-rate loans and $8.50 per month for adjustable-rate mortgage loans. To the extent that these loans become delinquent, our Servicer is entitled to an additional servicing fee per loan falling within a range of $10 to $75 per month and based on the delinquency, bankruptcy and foreclosure status of the loan or the related underlying real estate. Our Servicer is also entitled to customary ancillary income and certain market-based fees and charges, including boarding and deboarding fees, liquidation and disposition fees, and assumption, modification and origination fees.
Except as otherwise provided in our MSR recapture agreement, when our Servicer effects a refinancing of a loan on our behalf and not through a third-party lender and the resulting loan is readily saleable, or our Servicer originates a loan to facilitate the disposition of the real estate acquired by us in settlement of a loan, our Servicer is entitled to receive from us market-based fees and compensation consistent with pricing and terms our Servicer offers unaffiliated third parties on a retail basis.
 To the extent that our Servicer participates in HAMP (or other similar mortgage loan modification programs), our Servicer is entitled to retain any incentive payments made to it and to which it is entitled under HAMP, provided that, with respect to any incentive payments paid to our Servicer in connection with a mortgage loan modification for which we previously paid our Servicer a modification fee, our Servicer is required to reimburse us an amount equal to the incentive payments.
In addition, because we do not have any employees or infrastructure, our Servicer is required to provide a range of services and activities significantly greater in scope than the services provided in connection with a customary servicing arrangement. For these services, our Servicer receives a supplemental servicing fee of $25 per month for each distressed whole loan and $3.25 per month for each other subserviced loan; provided, however, that from and after January 1, 2014, the aggregate supplemental servicing fees for all loans that are owned by a third party investor and with respect to which we have acquired the related servicing rights (and that are not distressed whole loans) shall not exceed $700,000 in any fiscal quarter. Our Servicer is entitled to reimbursement for all customary, bona fide reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our Servicer in connection with the performance of its servicing obligations.
 Mortgage Banking and Warehouse Services Agreement. We have also entered into a mortgage banking and warehouse services agreement (the “MBWS agreement”), pursuant to which our Servicer provides us with certain mortgage banking services, including fulfillment and disposition-related services, with respect to loans acquired by us from correspondent lenders, and certain warehouse lending services, including fulfillment and administrative services, with respect to loans financed by us for our warehouse lending clients. The term of our MBWS agreement expires on February 1, 2017, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
Under our MBWS agreement, our Servicer has agreed to provide the mortgage banking services exclusively for our benefit, and our Servicer and its affiliates are prohibited from providing such services for any other third party. However, such exclusivity and prohibition shall not apply, and certain other duties instead will be imposed upon our Servicer, if we are unable to purchase or finance mortgage loans as contemplated under our MBWS agreement for any reason.
 In consideration for the mortgage banking services provided by our Servicer with respect to our acquisition of mortgage loans, our Servicer is entitled to a fulfillment fee based on the type of mortgage loan that we acquire and equal to a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of such mortgage loan. Presently, the applicable percentages are (i) 0.50% for conventional mortgage loans, (ii) 0.88% for loans sold in accordance with the Ginnie Mae Mortgage-Backed Securities Guide, (iii) 0.80% for HARP mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 105% or less, (iv) 1.20% for HARP mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio of greater than 105%, and (v) 0.50% for all other mortgage loans not contemplated above; provided, however, that PLS may, in its sole discretion, reduce the amount of the applicable fulfillment fee and credit the amount of such reduction to the reimbursement otherwise due as described below. This reduction may only be credited to the reimbursement applicable to the month in which the related mortgage was funded.
At this time, we do not hold the Ginnie Mae approval required to issue Ginnie Mae MBS and act as a servicer. Accordingly, under our MBWS agreement, our Servicer currently purchases loans saleable in accordance with the Ginnie Mae Mortgage-Backed Securities Guide “as is” and without recourse of any kind from us at cost less an administrative fee paid by the correspondent to us plus accrued interest and a sourcing fee of three basis points.
 In the event that we purchase mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance in any month greater than $2.5 billion, our Servicer has agreed to discount the amount of such fulfillment fees by reimbursing us an amount equal to the product of (i) 0.025%, and (ii) the amount of unpaid principal balance in excess of $2.5 billion and less than or equal to $5.0 billion, plus (b) the product of (i) 0.05%, and (ii) the amount of unpaid principal balance in excess of $5 billion.
In consideration for the mortgage banking services provided by our Servicer with respect to our acquisition of mortgage loans under our Servicer’s early purchase program, our Servicer is entitled to fees accruing (i) at a rate equal to $25,000 per annum, and (ii) in the amount of $50 for each mortgage loan that we acquire. In consideration for the warehouse services provided by our Servicer with respect to mortgage loans that we finance for our warehouse lending clients, with respect to each facility, our Servicer is entitled to fees accruing (i) at a rate equal to $25,000 per annum, and (ii) in the amount of $50 for each mortgage loan that we finance thereunder. Where we have entered into both an early purchase agreement and a warehouse lending agreement with the same client, our Servicer shall only be entitled to one $25,000 per annum fee and, with respect to any mortgage loan that becomes subject to both such agreements, only one $50 per loan fee.
 Notwithstanding any provision of our MBWS agreement to the contrary, if it becomes reasonably necessary or advisable for our Servicer to engage in additional services in connection with post-breach or post-default resolution activities for the purposes of a correspondent lending agreement, a warehouse agreement or a re-warehouse agreement, then we have generally agreed with our Servicer to negotiate in good faith for additional compensation and reimbursement of expenses to be paid to our Servicer for the performance of such additional services.
MSR Recapture Agreement. Effective February 1, 2013, we entered into an MSR recapture agreement with our Servicer. Pursuant to the terms of our MSR recapture agreement, if our Servicer refinances via its retail lending business loans for which we previously held the MSRs, our Servicer is generally required to transfer and convey to us, without cost to us, the MSRs with respect to new mortgage loans originated in those refinancings (or, under certain circumstances, other mortgage loans) that have an aggregate unpaid principal balance that is not less than 30% of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all the loans so originated. Where the fair market value of the aggregate MSRs to be transferred for the applicable month is less than $200,000, our Servicer may, at its option, wire cash to us in an amount equal to such fair market value in lieu of transferring such MSRs. The initial term of our MSR recapture agreement expires, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement, on February 1, 2017, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
 Spread Acquisition and MSR Servicing Agreements. Effective February 1, 2013, we entered into a master spread acquisition and MSR servicing agreement (the “2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement”), pursuant to which we may acquire from our Servicer the rights to receive certain excess servicing spread arising from MSRs acquired by our Servicer from banks and other third party financial institutions. Our Servicer is generally required to service or subservice the related mortgage loans for the applicable agency or investor. The terms of each transaction under the 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement are subject to the terms thereof, as modified and supplemented by the terms of a confirmation executed in connection with such transaction.
To the extent our Servicer refinances any of the mortgage loans relating to the excess servicing spread we have acquired, the 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement contains recapture provisions requiring that our Servicer transfer to us, at no cost, the excess servicing spread relating to a certain percentage of the unpaid principal balance of the newly originated mortgage loans. To the extent the fair market value of the aggregate excess servicing spread to be transferred for the applicable month is less than $200,000, our Servicer may, at its option, wire cash to us in an amount equal to such fair market value in lieu of transferring such excess servicing spread.
On December 30, 2013, we entered into a second master spread acquisition and MSR servicing agreement with our Servicer (the “12/30/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement”). The terms of the 12/30/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the 2/1/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement, except that we only intend to purchase excess servicing spread relating to Ginnie Mae MSRs under the 12/30/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement.
 To the extent our Servicer refinances any of the mortgage loans relating to the excess servicing spread we have acquired, the 12/30/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement also contains recapture provisions requiring that our Servicer transfer to us, at no cost, the excess servicing spread relating to a certain percentage of the unpaid principal balance of the newly originated mortgage loans. However, under the 12/30/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement, in any month where the transferred excess servicing spread relating to newly originated Ginnie Mae mortgage loans is not equivalent to at least 90% of the product of the excess servicing fee rate and the unpaid principal balance of the refinanced mortgage loans, our Servicer is also required to transfer additional excess servicing spread or cash in the amount of such shortfall. Similarly, in any month where the transferred excess servicing spread relating to modified Ginnie Mae mortgage loans is not equivalent to at least 90% of the product of the excess servicing fee rate and the unpaid principal balance of the modified mortgage loans, the 12/30/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement contains provisions that require our Servicer to transfer additional excess servicing spread or cash in the amount of such shortfall. To the extent the fair market value of the aggregate excess servicing spread to be transferred for the applicable month is less than $200,000, our Servicer may, at its option, wire cash to us in an amount equal to such fair market value in lieu of transferring such excess servicing spread.
 In connection with our entry into the 12/30/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement, we were also required to enter into a Security and Subordination Agreement (the “Security Agreement”) with CSFB. Under the terms of the Security Agreement, we pledged to CSFB our rights under the 12/30/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement and our interest in any excess servicing spread purchased thereunder. The Security Agreement was required as a result of a separate loan and security agreement between our Servicer and CSFB (the “LSA”), pursuant to which our Servicer pledged to CSFB all of its rights and interests in the Ginnie Mae MSRs it owns or acquires, and a separate acknowledgement agreement with respect thereto, by and among Ginnie Mae, CSFB and our Servicer. As a condition to permitting our Servicer to transfer to us the excess servicing spread relating to a portion of those pledged Ginnie Mae MSRs, CSFB required such transfer to be subject to CSFB’s continuing lien on the excess servicing spread, the pledge and acknowledgement of which were effected pursuant to the Security Agreement. CSFB’s lien on the excess servicing spread remains subordinate to the rights and interests of Ginnie Mae pursuant to the provisions of the 12/30/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement and the terms of the acknowledgement agreement.
 The Security Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants by us that are substantially similar to those contained in our other financing arrangements with CSFB. The Security Agreement also permits CSFB to liquidate our excess servicing spread along with the related MSRs to the extent there exists an event of default under the LSA, and it contains certain trigger events, including breaches of representations, warranties or covenants and defaults under other of our credit facilities, that would require our Servicer to either (i) repay in full the outstanding loan amount under the LSA or (ii) repurchase the excess servicing spread from us at fair market value. To the extent our Servicer is unable to repay the loan under the LSA or repurchase our excess servicing spread, an event of default would exist under the LSA, thereby entitling CSFB to liquidate the excess servicing spread and the related MSRs. In the event our excess servicing spread is liquidated as a result of certain actions or inactions of our Servicer, we generally would be entitled to seek indemnity under the 12/30/13 Spread Acquisition Agreement.
 Reimbursement Agreement. In connection with the initial public offering of our common shares (“IPO”), on August 4, 2009, we entered into an agreement with our Manager pursuant to which we agreed to reimburse our Manager for the $2.9 million payment that it made to the underwriters for the IPO (the “Conditional Reimbursement”) if we satisfied certain performance measures over a specified period of time. Effective February 1, 2013, we amended the terms of the reimbursement agreement to provide for the reimbursement of our Manager of the Conditional Reimbursement if we are required to pay our Manager performance incentive fees under our management agreement at a rate of $10 in reimbursement for every $100 of performance incentive fees earned. The reimbursement of the Conditional Reimbursement is subject to a maximum reimbursement in any particular 12-month period of $1.0 million and the maximum amount that may be reimbursed under the agreement is $2.9 million. The reimbursement agreement also provides for the payment to the IPO underwriters of the payment that we agreed to make to them at the time of the IPO if we satisfied certain performance measures over a specified period of time. As our Manager earns performance incentive fees under our management agreement, the IPO underwriters will be paid at a rate of $20 of payments for every $100 of performance incentive fees earned by our Manager. The payment to the underwriters is subject to a maximum reimbursement in any particular 12-month period of $2.0 million and the maximum amount that may be paid under the agreement is $5.9 million.
 In the event the termination fee is payable to our Manager under our management agreement and our Manager and the underwriters have not received the full amount of the reimbursements and payments under the reimbursement agreement, such amount will be paid in full. The term of the reimbursement agreement expires on February 1, 2019.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, real estate values and other market-based risks. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, inflation risk and market value risk. A substantial portion of our investments are comprised of nonperforming loans. We believe that such assets’ fair values respond primarily to changes in the fair value of the real estate securing such loans.
Real Estate Risk
Residential property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing); construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. Decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans, which could cause us to suffer losses.
 Credit Risk
We are subject to credit risk in connection with our investments. A significant portion of our assets is comprised of nonperforming residential mortgage loans. The credit risk related to these investments pertains to the ability and willingness of the borrowers to pay, which is assessed before credit is granted. We believe that residual loan credit quality is primarily determined by the borrowers’ credit profiles and loan characteristics.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of, interest income and net servicing income we earn from our mortgage-related investments. This effect is most pronounced with fixed-rate investments, MSRs and ESS. In general, rising interest rates negatively affect the fair value of our investments in MBS and mortgage loans, while decreasing market interest rates negatively affect the fair value of our MSRs and ESS.
Our operating results will depend, in part, on differences between the income from our investments and our financing costs. Presently much of our debt financing is based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over the relevant index, as determined by the particular financing arrangement.
In the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and/or economic downturn, defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, such defaults could have an adverse effect on the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.
 We engage in interest rate risk management activities in an effort to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in interest rates. To manage this price risk resulting from interest rate risk, we use derivative financial instruments acquired with the intention of moderating the risk that changes in market interest rates will result in unfavorable changes in the value of our interest rate lock commitments, inventory of mortgage loans acquired for sale, MBS, ESS, mortgage loans and MSRs. We do not use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than in support of our risk management activities.
Prepayment Risk
To the extent that the actual prepayment rate on our mortgage loans differs from what we projected when we purchased the loans and when we measured fair value as of the end of each reporting period, our unrealized gain or loss will be affected. As we receive prepayments of principal on our MBS investments, any premiums paid for such investments will be amortized against interest income using the interest method through the expected maturity dates of the investments. In general, an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the MBS investments and will accelerate the amortization of MSRs and ESS thereby reducing net servicing income. Conversely, as we receive prepayments of principal on our investments, any discounts realized on the purchase of such investments will be accrued into interest income using the interest method through the expected maturity dates of the investments. In general, an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the accrual of purchase discounts, thereby increasing the interest income earned on the MBS investments.
 Inflation Risk
Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors will influence our performance more so than inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Furthermore, our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and any distributions we may make to our shareholders will be determined by our board of trustees based primarily on our taxable income and, in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair value without considering inflation.
Market Value Risk
Our mortgage loans and MBS are reported at their estimated fair values. The fair value of these assets fluctuates primarily due to changes in real estate values and other factors such as interest rates, the credit performance relating to the loans underlying our investments and the effectiveness and servicing practices of the servicers associated with each investment.
Generally, in a real estate market where values are rising or are expected to rise, the fair value of our mortgage loans would be expected to appreciate, whereas in a real estate market where values are generally dropping or are expected to drop, mortgage loan values would be expected to decrease.
 The following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value of our portfolio of mortgage loans at fair value as of December 31, 2013, given several hypothetical (instantaneous) changes in home values from those used in the determination of fair value:

Accounting Developments
In December 2011, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update, (“ASU”), ASU 2011-11 to the Balance Sheet topic of the Codification. The amendments in this ASU affect all entities that have financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset in accordance with the Offsetting Presentation section of the Balance Sheet topic or the Presentation section of the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the Codification or (2) subject an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
 In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements established by ASU 2011-11. The ASU clarifies that the scope applied to derivatives accounted for in accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the Codification, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with the Offsetting Presentation section of the Balance Sheet topic or the Presentation section of the Derivatives and Hedging topic or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.
The amendments in this ASU require us to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangement to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of netting to an entity’s financial position. The ASU amendments and the subsequent clarification of the amendment are effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and are shown for all periods presented on the consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of these ASU amendments did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
In January of 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-04, Receivables-Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40) (“ASU 2014-04”). ASU 2014-04 clarifies when an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, that is, when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan should be derecognized and the real estate property recognized.
 ASU 2014-04 specifies that a creditor is considered to have received physical possession (resulting from an in substance repossession or foreclosure) of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan only upon the occurrence of either of the following:
a. The creditor obtains legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure. A creditor may obtain legal title to the residential real estate property even if the borrower has redemption rights that provide the borrower with a legal right for a period of time after a foreclosure to reclaim the real estate property by paying certain amounts specified by law.
b. The borrower conveys all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. The deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar legal agreement is completed when agreed-upon terms and conditions have been satisfied by both the borrower and the creditor.
ASU 2014-04 also requires disclosure of the carrying value of REO and its recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction. ASU 2014-04 is effective for the Company for annual and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2014.
 An entity can elect to adopt the amendments in this update using either a modified retrospective transition method or a prospective transition method. Under the modified retrospective transition method, an entity would apply the amendments in ASU 2014-04 by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to residential consumer mortgage loans and foreclosed residential real estate properties existing as of the beginning of the annual period for which the amendments are effective. The adoption of ASU-2014-04 is not expected to be material to our financial statements.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. However, no matter how well a control system is designed and operated, it can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports.
 Our management has conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992). Based on those criteria, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.

Article: As described above, in the case in which the content search is conducted according to the evaluation axis, in order to improve the accuracy of this search, it is necessary to increase the suitability of the evaluation axis itself. Then, in order to improve the evaluation axis once computed according to the process described above to be a more suitable evaluation axis, such a scheme is provided that the evaluation axis can be modified. The manner of modifying an evaluation axis will be described with reference to a flow chart shown in FIG. 14.
In Step S131, an evaluation axis to be a modification target is selected. The evaluation axis to be a modification target is the evaluation axes managed in the shared evaluation axis server 13 and the evaluation axes stored in the evaluation axis storage part 35. First, for example, a listing of the evaluation axes is displayed. Preferably, the listing displayed is a listing in which evaluation axes are visibly categorized in individual genres. Then, a user selects an evaluation axis desired to modify from the listing of the displayed evaluation axes. Then, information for identifying that selected evaluation axis is as well supplied to the evaluation axis modifying part 36 (FIG. 2), whereby the process in Step S131 is performed.
In Step S132, a search process using the selected evaluation axis is performed. For example, this search process is the process described with reference to the flow chart shown in FIG. 12. Here, the descriptions are omitted.
 In Step S133, a fitting content is added, and an unfitting content is deleted. The search process is performed in Step S132 to present the search result to the user side. In the case in which the presented content group includes a content that is determined as an unfitting one by the user, the content determined as an unfitting one is deleted. In addition, in the case in which the presented content group does not include such a content that is determined as one to be included by the user, the content determined as a fitting one is added.
In other words, the process in Step S133 is the process for reflecting what content the user desires as the content to be searched according to the evaluation axis selected by the user. To this end, the following process is performed; in the case in which the content desired to be present according to the selected evaluation axis is not presented, this content is added to the presented content group, whereas in the case in which the content desired not to be presented is presented, this content is deleted from the presented content group.
With performing such a process, when the search process according to the evaluation axis selected by the user is performed, the content group desired as the search result by the user is selected. In this state, in Step S134, an evaluation axis is again computed. The evaluation axis computing process performed in Step S134 is performed in the process in the flow chart shown in FIG. 10, omitting the descriptions. However, in the evaluation axis computing process in Step S134, only the contents included in the content group at the time at which the process in Step S133 is finished are the processing targets.
 In Step S135, it is determined whether the evaluation axis is successfully recomputed. For example, this determination can be performed by the following process in which the evaluation axis that is the recomputed result is used to again perform the search process for determining whether only the content group specified by the user is searched (the contents remaining at the time at which the process in Step S133 is finished).
In Step S135, if it is determined that the evaluation axis is not successfully recomputed, the process returns to Step S134, and an evaluation axis is again computed. At this time, for example, the feature volume to be mapped is changed to a feature volume different from the feature volume used in computing the evaluation axis in the previous process to make sure that a suitable evaluation axis is computed.
On the other hand, in Step S135, if it is determined that the evaluation axis is successfully recomputed, the evaluation axis modifying process is ended. Then, the modified evaluation axis is stored in the evaluation axis storage part 35 instead of the evaluation axis before modified.
As discussed above, a user can modify the evaluation axis. In addition, as discussed above, the evaluation axis is modified to compute the evaluation axis for suitably searching for a content desired by a user. As described above, the evaluation axis that can perform the search process highly suitably can be shared with the other users. Next, sharing the evaluation axis will be described with reference to a flow chart shown in FIG. 15.
 In Step S161, an evaluation axis is computed. The process in Step S161 has been described with reference to the flow chart shown in FIG. 10, omitting the descriptions. In addition, the process in Step S161 may be omitted. In other words, since the evaluation axis is already computed and stored in the evaluation axis storage part 35, the stored evaluation axis may be a processing target.
In Step S162, a name is given to the computed evaluation axis. With the use of an evaluation axes already stored, this process can be omitted because the evaluation axis has a name and stored as the evaluation axis is associated with that name.
In Step S163, the evaluation axis is uploaded. The evaluation axis with the name is supplied to the shared evaluation axis server 13 together with the name over the network 11 to start sharing the evaluation axis. The process so far is performed on the PC 12 side.
The evaluation axis receiving part 71 of the shared evaluation axis server 13 receives the evaluation axis supplied from the PC 12 and the name given to the evaluation axis. The received evaluation axis and the name are supplied to the evaluation axis reevaluating part 72. In Step S164, the evaluation axis reevaluating part 72 determines whether the name of the supplied evaluation axis is already registered.
 The shared evaluation axis server 13 has the evaluation axis sharing part 73, and a plurality of evaluation axes and names is stored therein as they are associated with each other. The evaluation axis reevaluating part 72 compares the name of the supplied evaluation axis with the names of the evaluation axes stored in the evaluation axis sharing part 73, and determines whether the same name is already stored in the evaluation axis sharing part 73.
In addition, although it is described that the same name is a search target, in addition to the identical name, for example, similar names and semantically the same names may be search targets. For example, such a configuration may be possible that the evaluation axis reevaluating part 72 is provided with a database such as a thesaurus in which the name similar to the supplied name is decided by referring to the database such as a thesaurus, and the decided similar name is also included as a search target.
In Step S164, if it is determined that the name of the evaluation axis is not overlapping, the process goes to Step S165, and the supplied evaluation axis is associated with the name of the evaluation axis and supplied and stored in the evaluation axis sharing part 73.
 On the other hand, in Step S164, if it is determined that the name of the evaluation axis is overlapping, the process goes to Step S166. In Step S166, it is determined whether the name of the evaluation axis is modified. For example, since the evaluation axis having the same name is already stored, a message is sent to the user having supplied the evaluation axis whether a new name is given to the evaluation axis and again registered. If a reply to the message is received from the user that a new name is given, in Step S166, it is determined that the name of the evaluation axis is modified. On the other hand, if a reply to the message is received from the user that a new name is not given, in Step S166, it is determined that the name of the evaluation axis is not modified.
In Step S166, if it is determined that the name of the evaluation axis is changed, the process returns to Step S162, and the processes after that are repeated. On the other hand, in Step S166, if it is determined that the name of the evaluation axis is not changed, the process goes to Step S167. In the case in which the process goes to Step S167, the evaluation axis sharing part 73 has the evaluation axis with the same name already stored therein. Thus, when the name of the evaluation axis is registered with no change, a plurality of evaluation axes with the same name can be registered. Then, when the evaluation axis with the same name is newly added and registered, such a process is performed that the evaluation axis with the same name already registered and the supplied evaluation axis are merged into a single evaluation axis.
 In Step S167, the evaluation axis is merged. In other words, the evaluation axis already stored and the uploaded evaluation axis are merged. As described above, for example, since the evaluation axis is configured of the parameters of the equation expressing the hyperplane, the mean value of the parameter is computed to merge the evaluation axis. Of course, the evaluation axis may be merged by the scheme other than the mean value. For the scheme of merge, such a method is preferable that the evaluation axis can be modified so as to suitably classify a predetermined content. In other words, such a method is preferable that the evaluation axis is modified to an evaluation axis which can perform a search process in which only the content fitting for the name of the evaluation axis is presented to the user side.
In addition, in the case in which the evaluation axis already stored and the uploaded evaluation axis are greatly different from each other when merged, it is likely that they are merged into a single evaluation axis to unsuitably classify contents. It is likely that merging the evaluation axes into a single evaluation axis does not achieve a suitable classification. Thus, in the case in which the evaluation axis already stored and the uploaded evaluation axis are greatly different from each other, such a process may be performed that a warning is sent to the user having uploaded the evaluation axis that the uploaded one is not suitable to the evaluation axis. Then, in this case, the merging process may not be performed. Moreover, the uploaded evaluation axis may be discarded.
 The evaluation axis modified in the process in Step S167 is stored in the evaluation axis sharing part 73. As discussed above, the evaluation axes with the same name are merged into a single evaluation axis. In addition, the same evaluation axes with the name are merged into a single evaluation axis, whereby such an evaluation axis can be created that the content fitting for the name given to the evaluation axis can be searched.
As described above, the evaluation axis is computed, modified, shared and used in making a search, whereby the following advantages can be expected. In other words, first, once an evaluation axis (tag) is given to a predetermined content or a predetermined content group, the essence of that tag can be evaluated for a content acquired after that and a content shared over the Internet, and then a search for a favorite content can be facilitated.
In addition, since the evaluation axis once computed can be applied to all the contents, it is unnecessary to perform such a process that the same evaluation axis is manually applied again and again to the other contents. In other words, the evaluation axis once computed is shared to eliminate the necessity to again compute this evaluation axis, and processing done by a large number of users can be omitted. Thus, the user's efforts can be eliminated.
In addition, a search is not a choice between two things whether the evaluation of the evaluation axis is matched or not, and a more flexible search can be conducted. In addition, the evaluation axis computed by other users can be shared, and a content search can be conducted according to the viewpoint (the evaluation axis (the name of the evaluation axis)) that a user does not recognize.
 In addition, in the embodiment described above, it is described that the evaluation axis is computed on the PC 12. For example, the embodiment of the invention can be adapted to a hard disk recorder that stores contents therein.
In addition, in the embodiment described above, the evaluation axis is computed from the feature volume of the content selected by a user. However, the evaluation axis may be computed from the feature volume of the content not selected by a user. In the case in which the evaluation axis is computed from the feature volume of the content not selected by a user, such an evaluation axis can be computed that contents are classified into a content undesired by a user and a content desired by a user.
Therefore, for example, an evaluation axis may be found from the feature volume of the content not selected by a user in the following cases: in the case in which the number of contents not selected by a user is greater than the number of contents selected by the user, and in the case in which it is preferable to compute an evaluation axis from many samples. In other words, such a scheme may be provided that the evaluation axis is computed by switching between the feature volume of the content selected by a user and the feature volume of the content not selected by a user depending on information such as the number of contents selected by the user as necessary.
 2. Recording Medium

A sequence of the process steps described above may be executed by hardware, or may be executed by software. In the case in which a series of the process steps is executed by software, a program configuring the software is installed in a computer incorporated in a dedicated hardware, or is installed from a program recording medium to a multi-purpose personal computer, for example, that can run various functions by installing various programs.
FIG. 16 shows a block diagram depicting an exemplary hardware configuration of a personal computer which executes a sequence of process steps according to a program.
In the computer, a CPU (Central Processing Unit) 301, a ROM (Read Only Memory) 302, and a RAM (Random Access Memory) 303 are connected to each other through a bus 305.
To the bus 305, an input/output interface 205 is further connected. To the input/output interface 205, the following components are connected: an input part 306 formed of a keyboard, a mouse, and a microphone, an output part 307 formed of a display and a speaker, a storage part 308 formed of a hard disk and a non-volatile memory, a communicating part 309 formed of a network interface, and a drive 310 that drives a removable medium 311 such as a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a magneto-optical disk, or a semiconductor memory.
In the computer thus configured, for example, the CPU 301 loads a program stored in the storage part 308 to the RAM 303 through the input/output interface 205 and the bus 305, whereby the sequence of process steps are performed.
 For example, the program executed by the computer (the CPU 301) is distributed by being recorded on the removable medium 311 that is a package medium such as a magnetic disk (including a flexible disk), an optical disk (CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only Memory), DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) and so on), a magneto-optical disk, or a semiconductor memory, or over a cable or wireless transmission medium such as a local area network, the Internet, and digital satellite broadcasting.
Then, the program can be installed in the storage part 308 through the input/output interface 205 by mounting the removable medium 311 on the drive 310. In addition, the program can be received by the communicating part 309 over a cable or wireless transmission medium and installed in the storage part 308. In addition to this, the program can be installed in the ROM 302 or the storage part 308 in advance.
In addition, the program executed by the computer may be a program in which the process steps are performed in a time series in order described in the specification, or a program in which the process steps are performed in parallel or at a necessary timing at which the program is called. Moreover, the invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, which can be modified within the scope not deviating from the teaching of the invention.

Article: open / show daterangepicker bootstrap by button or checkbox in jQuery
How do I display / open the daterangepicker calender by checking a checkbox?
I have a checkbox "display calender". I would like to open / show the daterangepicker by checking the checkbox. It would be the same functionality that is available when you click into the input field.
<div class="checkbox icheckbox_flat-aero">
  <label class="icheckbox_flat-aero">
    <input id="check_tempFilter" type="checkbox" value="tempFilter" style="text-align:right;">(activate)</label>
  <div id="d22" class="col-sm-4 col-md-offset-2 input-group">
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="daterange" name="daterange" />
  </div>
</div>

Is there something like:
$('daterange').show();

I alread have bound a daterangepicker to my inputfield "daterange". The checkbox click should just open / display the already existing daterangepicker.
$('input[name="daterange"]').daterangepicker({

    startDate: moment().subtract('days', 6),
        endDate: moment(),

        timePicker: true,         
        timePicker24Hour: true,
        timePickerSeconds:true,
        timePickerIncrement: 1,
        showDropdowns: true,

        locale: {       
            format: 'YYYY-MM-DD H:mm'               
        }
 });    

Any help is appreciated

I still haven't found, what I'm looking for.

$(function() {
  $('#check_tempFilter').click(function() {
    var $this = $(this);
    if (!$this.is(':checked')) {
      $this.daterangepicker();
    }
  });
  $('#check_tempFilter').daterangepicker();
});

Demo

A very good start, but I should have mentioned, that I already have a $('#daterange').daterangepicker(); That is the input field. And I want the checkbox to open the already existing daterangepicker, which is bound, to the input field!!

You can set the focus to the input field on click of that other element. This will open the daterange picker in the right spot, e.g. i have an  calender icon behind the input field that should trigger the daterange dialog. $name stands for the name of the input field:
    $('#calicon_$name').on('click',function(){
        $('input[name="fpara_$name"]').focus();
    });

In aqueous suspension, XAM has a particular affinity to certain cations. The cations include the alkaline earths Mg²⁺, Sr²⁺ and Ca²⁺, the transition metals Cu²⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺, Ag⁺, Fe²⁺, Cr³⁺ and Mn²⁺, the other metal cations Al³⁺, Zn²⁺, Cd²⁺, Pb²⁺ and Hg²⁺, the lanthanide Nd³⁺, and the actinide-containing cation UO₂ ²⁺. It is expected that XAM will also have affinity to other aqueous cations with similar size, shape and charge to those listed above. Also, due to the similar chemical behaviour of trivalent lanthanides it is assumed that the properties demonstrated for Nd³⁺ will apply to all trivalent lanthanides, including Y³⁺.
 The affinity of XAM for these cations has been demonstrated by measuring the percent uptake of each of these cations from a solution containing a low concentration (10-100 ppm) of the subject cation and a relatively high concentration of Na⁺ (0.1 M). The details of selectivity experiments together with their results are given in Table 4. The level of selectivity of XAM towards these cations is relatively independent of temperature but the rate of exchange is significantly enhanced by increase in temperature.
For the purpose of this invention, to identify those cations for which M-XAM (M=alkali metal) is highly selective in aqueous solution, we arbitrarily define high selectivity as removing ≧90% of that cation from a solution containing 0.1 M Na⁺ as background. We define M-XAM as being selective when ≧10% of that cation is removed under the same condition.

Applications of XAM

The high CEC which XAM displays and its high selectivity to a number of aqueous cations makes XAM potentially useful in the treatment of industrial and mine waste water, as well as in the remediation of contaminated environmental waters. In particular, its high selectivity to aqueous Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺, Cd²⁺, and Pb²⁺ all of which are toxic and environmentally problematic, make XAM particularly useful for such applications. It is probable the XAM will also sequester these cations from non-aqueous solvents or from liquid mixtures containing such non-aqueous solvents, such as wine.
XAM is also potentially suitable for application as a detergent builder or water softener as it shows a capability to sequester Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ from solution.
The potentially high CEC of XAM enables high loading levels of various cations. These highly exchanged XAMs may have application in the delivery of these cations in pharmaceuticals, stock feed, horticulture and agriculture.
XAMs which have been highly exchanged by transition metals or lanthanides are likely to have potential usage as heterogeneous catalysts.
Whilst the above has been given by way of illustrative example of the invention, many modifications and variations may be made thereto by persons skilled in the art without departing from the broad scope and ambit of the invention as herein set forth.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION

This application may be deemed related to commonly owned U.S. application Ser. No. 14/863,989 filed on Sep. 24, 2015 (now U.S. Pat. No. 9,868,539), the entire content of which is expressly incorporated hereinto by reference.
FIELD

The embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to assemblies to attach an aircraft engine (e.g., a turbojet engine) to the underside of an aircraft wing by way of an engine mounting pylon.
 BACKGROUND

In order to achieve design goals related to reduction of fuel consumption with its associated advantages of thereby reducing emissions of air pollutants and noise, there is a trend in the commercial aviation industry towards the adoption of turbojet engines having improved design criteria. These new generation turbojet (turbofan) engines are however larger and thus heavier than the existing engine models. On the other hand, newly designed wings are being proposed to match the new generation engines with the ultimate goal of achieving further fuel savings, i.e., wings that sustain lower induced drag due to a larger aspect ratio. These new larger aspect ratio wings however exhibit a characteristic that leads to smaller cross sections with reduced stiffness. Both of these factors contribute to the aeroelastic requirements becoming more critical than for the existing generation of commercial jets.
Taking into account the relatively larger weight and size of the new generation of turbojet engines and the fact that they will be installed under the newly designed wings with larger aspect ratio and thus smaller cross sections, the aeroelastic viability thereby becomes highly dependent on the design of the attachment assemblies to attach the engine mounting pylon to the underside of the wing. The existing solutions for the pylon-to-wing attachment cannot provide an appropriate stiffness for the new mass and geometric characteristics of the newer generation of larger turbojet engines that will readily satisfy flutter certification requirements, particularly when the engine pitch mechanisms are critical to ensure proper engine operation.
 Thus, if current pylon-to-wing attachment assemblies are to be adopted for the new generation of turbojet engines, it will become necessary to either increase the structural weight of the wing box or change the wing box construction materials (e.g., from traditional metallic alloys to stiffer and more expensive alternatives such as composite systems).
Therefore, what is needed in this art are turbojet engine pylon-to-wing mounting assemblies that will provide sufficient stiffness requirements to accommodate both the new generation of heavier turbojet engines and the larger aspect ratio (smaller cross-section) aircraft wings. It is towards providing such a solution that the embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are directed.
SUMMARY

According to the embodiments disclosed herein, pylon mounting assemblies are provided for mounting an engine to a wing of an aircraft which include an upper pylon connection member, and a lower pylon connection box, wherein the upper pylon connection member and the lower pylon connection box respectively include multiple opposed pairs of connection lobes. At least one pair of the connection lobes includes a pin connection to restrict degrees of freedom thereat along an x-axis and a mutually perpendicular z-axis, while at least one other pair of connection lobes includes a connection rod to restrict degrees of freedom thereat along the z-axis.
The multiple opposed pairs of connection lobes may include forward, intermediate and rearward pairs of connection lobes. According to some embodiments, the forward and rearward pairs of connection lobes include respective connection rods to restrict degrees of freedom thereat along the z-axis, and the intermediate pair of connection lobes includes a pin connection to restrict degrees of freedom thereat along the x-axis and the mutually perpendicular z-axis.
 Other embodiments will include intermediate and rearward pairs of connection lobes interconnected by respective connection rods to restrict degrees of freedom thereat along the z-axis, and the forward pair of connection lobes includes a pin connection to restrict degrees of freedom thereat along the x-axis and the mutually perpendicular z-axis.
Still other embodiments will include forward and intermediate pairs of connection lobes include respective pin connections to restrict degrees of freedom thereat along the x-axis and the mutually perpendicular z-axis, and wherein rearward pair of connection lobes includes a connection rod to restrict degrees of freedom thereat along the z-axis.
The upper pylon connection member may be a solid structure connected rigidly to a wing box of the aircraft wing and extend forwardly of the wing box of the aircraft wing. According to some embodiments the forward connection lobe of the upper pylon connection member may extend forwardly of and be downwardly dog-legged relative to the wing box.
These and other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more clear after careful consideration is given to the following detailed description of the preferred exemplary embodiments thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

Accompanying FIG. 1 depicts generally an aircraft 10 having a fuselage 10-1 and an exemplary wing 10-2 having leading and trailing edges 10-2 a and 10-2 b, respectively. The wing 10-2 is defined by a structural wing box 12 formed of wing spars 12-1 extending outwardly from the fuselage 10-1 and aerodynamically shaped rib elements 12-2 (see FIGS. 2-4). An exemplary turbojet engine 14 is shown attached to the underside of the wing 10-2 by way of a pylon mounting assembly 16 according to the invention. It will of course be understood that only the port side wing 10-2 and port side engine 14 are shown in FIG. 1 but are exemplary to the starboard side wing and engine that are not depicted therein. Thus, the description which follows applies equally to both wings and engines of the aircraft 10.
 FIG. 2 shows one embodiment for mounting of the aircraft turbojet engine 14 to the wing box 12 of the aircraft wing 10-2 by way of the pylon mounting assembly 16 according to the invention in greater detail. As is shown, the pylon mounting assembly 16 is comprised of an upper pylon connection member 16-1 and a lower pylon box structure 16-2 connected to one another by the connector assembly 18 a. The upper pylon connection member 16-1 is most preferably a solid structure (i.e., a solid mass of lightweight metal alloy) attached rigidly to and extending forwardly of the wing box 12 to thereby extend forwardly of the leading edge 10-2 a of the wing 10-2 along an elongate axis of the lower pylon box structure 16-2 relative to the aircraft's travel direction (noted by arrow A in FIGS. 2-4). The lower pylon box structure 16-2 is however preferably formed of interconnected lattice structure of individual longitudinal and latitudinal support members (not shown). In the interests of improved aerodynamics, both the upper pylon connection member 16-1 and the lower pylon box structure 16-2 may be covered by a suitable skin structure (not shown), e.g., aluminum alloy sheet.
 A connection lobe 16-1 a forwardly extends from a terminal end of the upper pylon connection member 16-1. In the embodiment depicted, the connection lobe 16-1 a is generally a forwardly V-shaped forward extension of the upper pylon connection member 16-1. The wing box 12 is provided with intermediate and a rearward connection lobes 16-1 b and 16-1 c, respectively. The lower pylon box structure 16-2 includes a series of connection lobes including a forward connection lobe 16-2 a, an intermediate connection lobe 16-2 b and a rearward extension lobe 16-2 c. It will be observed that the lower pylon box structure 16-2 includes a rearward end section which extends below the wing box 12 so that the wing box 12 and the rearward end of the pylon box structure may be connected together at the opposed pair of rearward lobes 16-1 c, 16-2 c. The forward end section of the pylon box structure 16-2 extends forwardly of the upper pylon connection member 16-1 so as to accommodate the engine 14. The engine 14 is dependently connected to the bottom of the lower pylon box structure 16-2 by means of conventional forward and aft engine mounting devices 19 a, 19 b, respectively.
 The pairs of forward and rearward connection lobes 16-1 a, 16-2 a and 16-1 c, 16-2 c are connected together by linkage rods 18 a and 18 c, respectively. The linkage rods 18 a, 18 c thereby restrict the degrees of freedom for each such pairs of forward and rearward connection lobes 16-1 a, 16-2 a and 16-1 c, 16-2 c in the z direction (i.e., an upward direction perpendicular to the travel direction of the aircraft (arrow A). The pair of intermediate lobes 16-1 b, 16-2 b however are connected together by a connection pin 18 b which restricts the degree of freedom thereat along both the x direction (parallel to the travel direction of arrow A) and the z direction (upwardly perpendicular to the travel direction of arrow A). These connections thereby serve to provide adequate stiffness for mounting of the engine 14 to satisfy flutter requirements, particularly for engine pitch mechanisms.
In order to meet crashworthiness certification requirements, the various connection pins and connection rods may be provided with conventional fuse pins (rupture pins) to break away in the event that an excessive separatory force is encountered. In the embodiment according to FIG. 2, the connection pin 18 b is a fuse pin (rupture pin), the linkage rod 18 a has a fuse pin (rupture pin) at its lower end which is connected to the lobe 16-2 a and the linkage rod 18 c has a fuse pin (rupture pin) at its lower end which is connected to the lobe 16-2 c.
 An alternative embodiment of for mounting of the aircraft turbojet engine 14 to the wing box 12 of the aircraft wing 10-2 by way of a pylon mounting assembly 16′ according to the invention is shown in accompanying FIG. 3 in greater detail. In this regard, structures that are similar to those depicted in FIG. 2 have been shown in FIG. 3 with the same reference numeral but with a prime (′) designator. It will be noted that, like the upper pylon connection member 16-1 of assembly 16, the upper pylon connection member 16-1′ of assembly 16′ is likewise most preferably a solid structure (i.e., a solid mass of lightweight metal alloy) attached rigidly to and extending forwardly of the wing box 12 relative to the aircraft's travel direction (noted by arrow A). In the interests of improved aerodynamics, both the upper pylon connection member 16-1′ and the lower pylon box structure 16-2 may be covered by a suitable skin structure (not shown), e.g., aluminum alloy sheet.
 The upper pylon connection member 16-1′ includes a forwardly extending and downwardly dog-legged connection lobe 16-1 a′. The wing box 12 is provided with intermediate and a rearward connection lobes 16-1 b′ and 16-1 c′, respectively. The lower pylon box structure 16-2 includes a series of connection lobes including a forward connection lobe 16-2 a′, an intermediate connection lobe 16-2 b′ and a rearward extension lobe 16-2 c′. It will be observed that the lower pylon box structure 16-2 includes a rearward end section which extends below the wing box 12 so that the wing box 12 and the rearward end of the pylon box structure may be connected together at the opposed pair of rearward lobes 16-1 c′, 16-2 c′. The forward end section of the pylon box structure 16-2 extends forwardly of the upper pylon connection member 16-1′ so as to accommodate the engine 14.
According to the embodiment of the pylon connection assembly 16′ depicted in FIG. 3, the pairs of intermediate and rearward connection lobes 16-1 b′, 16-2 b′ and 16-1 c′, 16-2 c′ are connected together by linkage rods 18 b′ and 18 c′, respectively. The linkage rods 18 b′, 18 c′ thereby restrict the degrees of freedom for each such pairs of forward and rearward connection lobes 16-1 b′, 16-2 b′ and 16-1 c′, 16-2 c′ in the z direction (i.e., an upward direction perpendicular to the travel direction of the aircraft (arrow A). The pair of forward lobes 16-1 a′, 16-2 a′ however are connected together by a connection pin 18 a′ which restricts the degree of freedom thereat along both the x direction (parallel to the travel direction of arrow A) and the z direction (upwardly perpendicular to the travel direction of arrow A).
 In order to meet crashworthiness certification requirements, the various connection pins and connection rods may be provided with conventional fuse pins (rupture pins) to break away in the event that an excessive separatory force is encountered. In the embodiment according to FIG. 3, the connection pin 18 a′ is a fuse pin (rupture pin), the linkage rod 18 b′ has a fuse pin (rupture pin) at its lower end which is connected to the lobe 16-2 b′ and the linkage rod 18 c′ has a fuse pin (rupture pin) at its lower end which is connected to the lobe 16-2 c′.
A further alternative embodiment of for mounting of the aircraft turbojet engine 14 to the wing box 12 of the aircraft wing 10-2 by way of a pylon mounting assembly 16″ according to the invention is shown in accompanying FIG. 4 in greater detail. In this regard, it will be observed that structures that are similar to those depicted in FIG. 2 or 3 have been shown in FIG. 4 with the same reference numeral but with a double prime (″) designator.
It will be noted that, like the upper pylon connection members 16-1 and 16-1′ of assemblies 16 and 16′, respectively, the upper pylon connection member 16-1″ of assembly 16″ is likewise most preferably a solid structure (i.e., a solid mass of lightweight metal alloy) attached rigidly to and extending forwardly of the wing box 12 relative to the aircraft's travel direction (noted by arrow A). In the interests of improved aerodynamics, both the upper pylon connection member 16-1″ and the lower pylon box structure 16-2 may be covered by a suitable skin structure (not shown), e.g., aluminum alloy sheet.
 The upper pylon connection member 16-1″ includes a forwardly extending and downwardly dog-legged connection lobe 16-1 a″. The wing box 12 is provided with intermediate and a rearward connection lobes 16-1 b″ and 16-1 c″, respectively. The lower pylon box structure 16-2 includes a series of connection lobes including a forward connection lobe 16-2 a″, an intermediate connection lobe 16-2 b″ and a rearward extension lobe 16-2 c″. It will be observed that the lower pylon box structure 16-2 includes a rearward end section which extends below the wing box 12 so that the wing box 12 and the rearward end of the pylon box structure may be connected together at the opposed pair of rearward lobes 16-1 c″, 16-2 c″. The forward end section of the pylon box structure 16-2 extends forwardly of the upper pylon connection member 16-1″ so as to accommodate the engine 14.
According to the embodiment of the pylon connection assembly 16″ depicted in FIG. 4, the pair of rearward connection lobes 16-1 c″, 16-2 c″ is connected together by a linkage rods 18 c″. The linkage rod 18 c″ thereby restricts the degrees of freedom for the pair of rearward connection lobes 16-1 c″, 16-2 c″ in the z direction (i.e., an upward direction perpendicular to the travel direction of the aircraft (arrow A). However, the pairs of forward and intermediate lobes 16-1 a″, 16-2 a″ and 16-1 b″, 16-2 b″ are connected together by connection pin 18 a″, 18 b″, respectively, which restrict the degrees of freedom thereat along both the x direction (parallel to the travel direction of arrow A) and the z direction (upwardly perpendicular to the travel direction of arrow A).
 In order to meet crashworthiness certification requirements, the various connection pins and connection rods may be provided with conventional fuse pins (rupture pins) to break away in the event that an excessive separatory force is encountered. In the embodiment according to FIG. 4, the connection pin 18 a″ is a fuse pin (rupture pin), the connection pin 18 b″ is a fuse pin (rupture pin) and the linkage rod 18 c″ has a fuse pin (rupture pin) at its lower end which is connected to the lobe 16-2 c″.

Article: Get specific date, from specific day last week
I'm planning to get date from specific day from last week in node.js
For example if today is Friday or any day, I want to know what date is Sunday from the last week
I'm thinking to have this solution in using JS library or PostgreSQL.
My goal were to be able to query Sunday last week to 13 weeks before that.

And what did you tried yourself?

Which day is the first day of the week? Is Sunday last week the previous Sunday or the one prior to that? The previous Sunday is given by d.setDate(d.getDate() - (d.getDay() || 7)).

After research and trying I find this way will be the best way, by using moment.js:
const moment = require('moment')

// by use moment subtract 1 week and with endOf means we want to take
// the last day date from the last week which is Sunday in this case

let expectedDate = moment().subtract(1, 'week').endOf().format('yyyy-mm-dd')

console.log(expectedDate)


Postgres simple direct date manipulation routines: What you asking is accomplished by interval subtraction and the date_trunc() function. For your example of 2022-08-20 I assume you want 2022-08-07 (Sunday of the prior week). So
select (date_trunc('week', (current_date - interval '1 week')) - interval '1 day')::date;

How it works:

current_date - interval '1 week': Calculates the date 1 week prior.
date_trunc('week', (...): Calculates the Monday prior to result of #1
above
interval '1 day': Calculates the Sunday prior to #2 above
(...)::date: Casts the result of #3 above back to just a date. Needed since all interval calculations generate timestamps results.

As far as getting start of week for several weeks back wrap the above in a SQL function with the number of desired weeks as a parameter and multiple the - '1 week' by that value. (See demo)

You can use this NPM Package for getting Dates
Moment.js 2.29.4
Parse, validate, manipulate,
and display dates and times in JavaScript
https://momentjs.com/
Momentjs is most popular and powerful


// Last week
console.log(moment().subtract(7, 'days').calendar());
console.log(moment().subtract(1, 'week').endOf().format('yyyy-MM-dddd')); // 2022-08-Sunday
console.log(moment().subtract(1, 'week').endOf().format('yyyy-MM-DD')); // 2022-08-Sunday
// formats
console.log(moment.locale());         // en
console.log(moment().format('LT'));   // 3:10 PM
console.log(moment().format('LTS'));  // 3:10:58 PM
console.log(moment().format('L'));    // 08/20/2022
console.log(moment().format('l'));    // 8/20/2022
console.log(moment().format('LL'));   // August 20, 2022
console.log(moment().format('ll'));   // Aug 20, 2022
console.log(moment().format('LLL'));  // August 20, 2022 3:10 PM

hey thank you for your insight do you know specifically how to get specific day from last week using moment?

okay - can you tell more like an example with real values?
today is 20-Aug-2022 so you want ?

sure like if i use today is 2022-08-20 i wish to get exact date of sunday last week

This might be a useful comment, it's not an answer.

check now - my code snippet at top

It still doesn't answer the question.

Here is the exact solution that you are looking for in vanilla JS.
To find the Sunday of the previous week and "n" weeks before that:


function getSunday(previousWeeks = 1) {
  return new Date(
    new Date().setDate(
      new Date().getDate() + (7 - new Date().getDay()) - 7 * previousWeeks
    )
  );
}


 // this function can be used as following -
 //assuming that sunday is last day of the week 
   
console.log(getSunday()); // get sunday of previous week 
console.log(getSunday(7));//get sunday before 7 weeks
console.log(getSunday(0)); //get sunday of this week
console.log(getSunday(-1)); // get sunday of upcoming week




In advance: my PostgreSQL knowledge is very limited, so there might be better ways. Having said this, PostgreSQL provides a number of Date/Time Functions and Operators.
One can extract the current day of week (ISO numbering) using EXTRACT(ISODOW FROM CURRENT_DATE), which would return 6 if executed on a saturday, and 7 if executed on a sunday. Therefore you simply need to subtract the value from 7 to get the number of days to the next sunday. Add this value to the current date and you'll have the date of the upcoming sunday. From this you just need to subtract the desired interval, e. g.
SELECT CAST(
         CURRENT_DATE + CAST(7 - EXTRACT(ISODOW FROM CURRENT_DATE) AS integer) -
         MAKE_INTERVAL(weeks => 2) 
       AS DATE)

will return 2022-08-07 because it's the sunday two weeks before the upcoming sunday at 2022-08-21.

thank you for trying to help bro, i find using moment.js as a library for node.js will be much easier to use instead of querying from SQL IMHO, btw thank you cheers!

TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a CZTS-basedthin film for use in a CZTS-based solar cell, and more particularly, toa method of manufacturing a CZTS-based thin film having a dual band gapslope to thus improve solar cell efficiency.
BACKGROUND ART

Recently, the need to develop next-generation clean energy is increasingin importance due to serious environmental pollution problems and theexhaustion of fossil energy. Especially, solar cells, which are used todirectly convert solar energy into electric energy, are expected tobecome an energy source able to solve the energy problems of the futurebecause they generate less pollution, utilize unlimited solar resourcesand have a semi-permanent lifespan.
 Solar cells are classified into a variety of types depending on thematerial for an absorber layer. Currently, the most commonly used is aSi solar cell using Si. However, as the price of Si has drasticallyincreased attributable to the recent Si supply shortage, thin-film solarcells are receiving attention. Thin-film solar cells are thin and enablesmaller amounts of materials to be consumed, and are also light and havea wider range of utilization. Thorough research is ongoing into usingamorphous Si and CdTe, CIS (CuInSe₂) or CIGS (CuIn_(1-x)Ga_(x)Se₂) asmaterials of such thin-film solar cells.
A CIS or CIGS thin film corresponds to a Group I-III-IV compoundsemiconductor, and exhibits the highest conversion efficiency (about19.9%) among thin-film solar cells which have been experimentallyproduced. In particular, this thin film may be manufactured to athickness of 10 μm or less and is stable even upon extended use, and isthereby expected to replace Si to thus fabricate inexpensivehigh-efficiency solar cells.
Furthermore, the CIS thin film is a direct transition type semiconductorand may thus be provided in the form of a thin film, and has a band gapof 1.04 eV that is comparatively adapted for light conversion, and thelight absorption coefficient thereof is the greatest amongst the knownsolar cell materials. The CIGS thin film has been developed by replacinga portion of In with Ga or replacing Se with S to improve the lowopen-circuit voltage of the CIS thin film. However, the CIS or CIGS thinfilm has comparatively high production costs because of the use ofexpensive In and Ga elements, and the band gap thereof is slightly low.
In order to increase the efficiency of solar cells and achieve costsavings, novel materials and manufacturing able to further increase aband gap and to use inexpensive elements have to be devised.
 As part of the recent efforts for developing novel materials to replacethe In element with inexpensive elements, the preparation of aCu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film (hereinafter referred to as “CZTS-based thinfilm”) wherein In is replaced with inexpensive Zn and Sn is under activestudy.
However, because the CZTS-based thin film has lower efficiency than thatof the CIS or CIGS thin film, extensive and intensive research intoincreasing the efficiency thereof is being carried out.
Meanwhile, because the conduction band of the CIGS thin film isdetermined by a bonding relation of Ga and In, the band gap may bechanged by way of changing the Ga/(In+Ga) ratio (“The effect ofGa-grading in CIGS thin film solar cells”, Thin Solid Films, Volumes480-481, 1 Jun. 2005, Pages 520-525), and FIG. 6 is a graph illustratingchanges in band gap depending on changes in the Ga proportion in theCIGS thin film.
Moreover, the band gap of CIGS may be controlled by adjusting the Gaproportion, and thereby the Ga and In proportions are changed in thecourse of preparation of the CIGS thin film, thus increasing theefficiency of the CIGS thin-film solar cell using a double gradingstructure in which a double band gap slope is imparted in the CIGS thinfilm.
FIG. 7 schematically illustrates the case where a double band gap slopeis formed in a CIGS thin film (“High efficiency graded bandgap thin-filmpolycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se₂-based solar cells”, Solar Energy Materialsand Solar Cells 41/42 (1996) 231-246).
When the band gap of the front side of the CIGS thin film is higher thanthat of the center thereof, open-circuit voltage may increase andrecombination may be reduced. Also, when the band gap of the back sideof the CIGS thin film is higher than that of the center thereof,electron mobility may increase.
 However, the CZTS thin film is disadvantageous because the band gap ofthe CZTS-based thin film cannot be changed by way of changing the Zn/Snratio, making it impossible to attain improvements in solar cellefficiency through the double grading structure.

Technical Solution

In order to accomplish the above object, an aspect of the presentinvention provides a method of manufacturing a CZTS-based thin filmhaving a dual band gap slope, comprising forming a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin filmlayer; forming a Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer; and forming a Cu₂ZnSnS₄thin film layer.
The present inventors have noticed changes in the band gap depending onthe amounts of S and Se contained in the CZTS-based thin film and thushave devised a method of manufacturing a CZTS-based thin film having adouble band gap slope by sequentially forming a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin filmlayer, a Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer and a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer.

In the present invention, synthesizing the precursor thin film ispreferably performed using any one process selected from amongco-evaporation, sputtering, electrodeposition, nanoparticle depositionand solution coating.
Also, sulfurization is preferably performed by thermal treatment in anH₂S atmosphere or injection of S into a thin film using a vacuumevaporation process, and selenization is preferably carried out bythermal treatment in an H₂Se atmosphere or injection of Se into a thinfilm using a vacuum evaporation process.
Another aspect of the present invention provides a method ofmanufacturing a CZTS-based solar cell having a dual band gap slope,comprising forming a back contact; and forming, on the back contact, aCZTS-based thin film layer using any one method among the above methods.
A further aspect of the present invention provides a CZTS-based solarcell, comprising a back contact; and a CZTS-based thin film layer formedon the back contact, wherein the CZTS-based thin film layer comprises aCu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer, a Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer and aCu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer which are sequentially formed, and the bandgap energy of the Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer is lower than that ofthe Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer.
 According to the present invention, the CZTS-based solar cell includes aCZTS-based thin film layer having a dual band gap slope by adjusting theS and Se proportions, and the band gap of the front side of theCZTS-based thin film layer is higher to thus increase open-circuitvoltage and reduce recombination, and the band gap of the back side ofthe CZTS-based thin film layer is higher to thus increase electronmobility, ultimately improving the efficiency of the solar cell.
Such a CZTS-based solar cell is preferably configured such that theCu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer is thicker than the Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin filmlayer.
Advantageous Effects

According to the present invention, a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer, aCu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer and a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer aresequentially formed, and thereby the band gap of the Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thinfilm layer positioned therebetween is low, thus effectively forming adouble band gap slope.
Also, a CZTS-based thin film layer having a dual band gap slope has ahigh band gap at the front side thereof, thus increasing open-circuitvoltage and reducing recombination, and has a high band gap at the backside thereof, thus increasing electron mobility, thereby improvingefficiency of solar cells.

MODE FOR INVENTION

Hereinafter, a detailed description will be given of embodiments of thepresent invention with reference to the appended drawings.
FIG. 1 is a flowchart illustrating a process of manufacturing aCZTS-based thin film according to the present invention, and FIG. 2 is aschematic view illustrating the structure of a CZTS-based thin filmlayer according to the present invention.
In order to form a CZTS-based thin film having a double band gap slopeaccording to the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 1, aCu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer, a Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer and aCu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer are sequentially formed.
 As illustrated in FIG. 2, a CZTS-based thin film layer 300 is providedon a Mo back contact 200 on a glass substrate 100, the CZTS-based thinfilm layer comprising a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer, a Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thinfilm layer and a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer which are sequentiallyformed.
The band gap of Cu₂ZnSnS₄ is known to fall in the range of 1.32˜1.85 eV,the band gap of Cu₂ZnSnSe₄ approximates to 1.02 eV lower than that, andthe band gap of Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ is positioned therebetween.
Therefore, the CZTS-based thin film layer 300 having the above layerconfiguration according to the present invention has a high band gap atthe front side and the back contact 200 side and has a low band gaptherein, and thus the CZTS-based thin film layer 300 having a dual bandgap slope formed therein toward the front side and the back contact sidemay be formed.
Furthermore, it is preferable that the Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layertypically known to have excellent photoelectric conversion efficiency bethicker than the Cu₂ZnSnSe₄ thin film layer.
According to the present invention, the CZTS-based solar cell has tofurther include a front reflective layer or a front contact in additionto the structure of FIG. 2, but such a typical configuration may beapplied without particular limitation and a detailed description thereofis omitted.
Specific examples for sequentially forming the Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin filmlayer, the Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer and the Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin filmlayer are described below.
EXAMPLE 1

FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a process of manufacturing aCZTS-based thin film according to a first embodiment of the presentinvention.
 In accordance with the first embodiment, a CZTS-based thin filmcomprising a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer, a Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layerand a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer which are sequentially formed isprovided, by forming a precursor thin film comprising Cu, Zn and Sn, andsequentially subjecting the precursor thin film to primarysulfurization, selenization and secondary sulfurization.
Specifically, the precursor thin film comprising Cu, Zn and Sn is firstformed.
Although formation of the precursor thin film is typically carried outusing a co-evaporation process, any process such as sputtering,electrodeposition, nanoparticle deposition and solution coating may beapplied.
Because the precursor thin film of the present embodiment is formed intothe CZTS-based thin film through sulfurization and selenization, it hasto be formed to a thickness of 0.5˜2 μm.
The Cu—Zn—Sn precursor thin film thus formed is subjected to primarysulfurization, thus forming Cu₂ZnSnS₄. Examples of the sulfurizationprocess may include thermal treatment in an H₂S atmosphere, and thermaltreatment after injection of S into a precursor thin film using a vacuumevaporation process.
Such thermal treatment is performed under conditions of a substratetemperature of 400˜530° C. and a pressure of 1 mtorr˜300 torr for 1˜20min.
The thin film subjected to primary sulfurization is selenized to giveCu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄. Examples of the selenization process may include thermaltreatment in an H₂Se atmosphere, and thermal treatment after injectionof Se into a precursor thin film using a vacuum evaporation process.
Such thermal treatment is performed under conditions of a substratetemperature of 400˜530° C. and a pressure of 1 mtorr˜300 torr for 1˜20min.
Finally, the selenized thin film is subjected to secondarysulfurization, thus forming Cu₂ZnSnS₄. Examples of the sulfurizationprocess may include thermal treatment in an H₂S atmosphere, and thermaltreatment after injection of S into a precursor thin film using a vacuumevaporation process.
 Thermal treatment is implemented under conditions of a substratetemperature of 400˜530° C. and a pressure of 1 mtorr˜300 torr for 1˜20min.
EXAMPLE 2

FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a process of manufacturing aCZTS-based thin film according to a second embodiment of the presentinvention.
In accordance with the second embodiment, a CZTS-based thin filmcomprising a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer, a Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layerand a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer which are sequentially formed isprovided, by forming a precursor thin film comprising Cu, Zn, Sn and Sand sequentially subjecting the precursor thin film to selenization andsulfurization.
Specifically, the precursor thin film comprising Cu, Zn, Sn and S isfirst formed. This embodiment is different in terms of containing S atthe step of forming the precursor thin film from the first embodiment.
The precursor thin film is typically formed using a co-evaporationprocess, but any process such as sputtering, electrodeposition,nanoparticle deposition and solution coating may be applied.
Because the precursor thin film of the present embodiment is formed intothe CZTS-based thin film through selenization and sulfurization, it hasto be formed to a thickness of 0.5˜2 μm.
The Cu—Zn—Sn—S precursor thin film thus formed is selenized, thusforming Cu₂ZnSnS₄ and Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄.
Because S is contained in the precursor thin film, it is possible toform the structure in which Cu₂ZnSnS₄ and Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ aresequentially positioned through selenization, without performingsulfurization. Examples of the selenization process may include thermaltreatment in an H₂Se atmosphere, and thermal treatment after injectionof Se into a precursor thin film using a vacuum evaporation process.
Such thermal treatment is performed under conditions of a substratetemperature of 400˜530° C. and a pressure of 1 mtorr˜300 torr for 1˜20min.
 Finally, the selenized thin film is subjected to secondarysulfurization, thus forming Cu₂ZnSnS₄. Examples of the sulfurizationprocess may include thermal treatment in an H₂S atmosphere, and thermaltreatment after injection of S into a precursor thin film using a vacuumevaporation process.
Thermal treatment is implemented under conditions of a substratetemperature of 400˜530° C. and a pressure of 1 mtorr˜300 torr for 1˜20min.
EXAMPLE 3

FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a process of manufacturing aCZTS-based thin film according to a third embodiment of the presentinvention.
In accordance with the third embodiment, a CZTS-based thin filmcomprising a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer, a Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layerand a Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer which are sequentially formed isprovided, by forming three precursor thin films comprising Cu, Zn andSn, and sequentially subjecting respective precursor thin films toprimary sulfurization, selenization and secondary sulfurization.
Specifically, a first precursor thin film comprising Cu, Zn and Sn isformed above all.
The first precursor thin film is typically formed using a co-evaporationprocess, but any process such as sputtering, electrodeposition,nanoparticle deposition and solution coating may be applied.
Because the first precursor thin film of the present embodiment isformed into the Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer through sulfurization, it isformed to be thin to the extent of 0.1˜0.5 μm.
The first precursor thin film thus formed is subjected to primarysulfurization, thus forming the Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer. Examples ofthe sulfurization process may include thermal treatment in an H₂Satmosphere, and thermal treatment after injection of S into a precursorthin film using a vacuum evaporation process. Such thermal treatment isperformed under conditions of a substrate temperature of 400˜530° C. anda pressure of 1 mtorr˜300 torr for 1˜20 min.
 Provided on the Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer is a second precursor thinfilm comprising Cu, Zn and Sn. The second precursor thin film is formedin the same manner as in the first precursor thin film, and adescription thereof is omitted. However, because the second precursorthin film is formed into the Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer throughselenization, its thickness is set to 0.5˜1 μm.
The second precursor thin film is selenized to give the Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄thin film layer. Examples of the selenization process may includethermal treatment in an H₂Se atmosphere, and thermal treatment afterinjection of Se into a precursor thin film using a vacuum evaporationprocess. Such thermal treatment is performed under conditions of asubstrate temperature of 400˜530° C. and a pressure of 1 mtorr˜300 torrfor 1˜20 min.
Provided on the Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer is a third precursor thinfilm comprising Cu, Zn and Sn. The formation process and the thicknessof the third precursor thin film are the same as in the first precursorthin film, and a description thereof is omitted.
The third precursor thin film thus formed is subjected to secondarysulfurization, thus forming the Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer. Examples ofthe sulfurization process may include thermal treatment in an H₂Satmosphere, and thermal treatment after injection of S into a precursorthin film using a vacuum evaporation process. Furthermore, thermaltreatment is conducted under conditions of a substrate temperature of400˜530° C. and a pressure of 1 mtorr˜300 torr for 1˜20 min.
 The third embodiment is performed in such a manner that three precursorthin films are formed and each precursor thin film is subjected tosulfurization or selenization, and is thus different from the otherembodiments. Although the third embodiment has more complicatedprocesses compared to the other embodiments, it makes it easy to adjustthe thickness of the Cu₂ZnSnS₄ thin film layer and the Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄thin film layer, thus facilitating the formation of the structurewherein the Cu₂ZnSn(S,Se)₄ thin film layer is thicker than the Cu₂ZnSnS₄thin film layer.
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have beendisclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art willappreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions arepossible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventionas disclosed in the accompanying claims.

He tells him then, that if he had ſeen him likely to ſpend his whole Life in Softneſs, Lazineſs, and all the Amuſements of Youth, he ſhould have ceas'd loving him. But that as he ſaw him paſſionately aſpiring after Glory, the love he bore to him was renew'd and augmented ; that he came to offer him all neceſſary Helps,becauſe of all the Lovers he had had, he was the only Perſon who was able to ſerve him in his Ambition; and that by this means he might know the difference between ſuch as love on- ly Corporal Beauty, that frail and withering Flow- cr, and one that loves only the Beauty of the Soul. which being perfect is the true Image of the Deity. This great Promiſe fixes the reſtleſs Humor of this ambirious young Man, and diſpoſes him to hear what he had to lay. | OO Socrates immediatly throws him into the midſt of that Aſſembly, whether he was going to get himſelf declar'd General of the Athenians ; and with abun- dance of addreſs, ſhows him, that inſtead of that great Ability with which he flatter d himſelf, he had indeed nothing in him but the Prejudices of his Youth, accompanied with a great deal of Arrogance and Pre- ſumption. When you are in that Aſſembly (ſays he) you'll riſe up to ſpeak without doubt of ſuch Things * wile'how could you preſume to ſpeak? But a Man knows nothing but what he has either found out himſelf; or learn'd of ſome other Perſon. I don't know any thing that you have found out your ſelf, jou know rather than any otherMatrers; for other- your Knowledge is not by Infuſion; and all the. Knowlege you have learn'd, is only to write, to play on che Muſick, and ta perform your Exerciſes, and none of theſe Things are talk'd of in the Coun- cil. Therefore when will you ga? and what will you go for? It muſt not be. when they diſcourſe of Buildings; the meaneſt Brick layer would ſpeak when better than you on thay Subject: Nor muſt it be An Abridgment of the when they are conſidering any Prodigies, or any Point of Divination, for ack the Buſineſs of the Diviners ; and fo of other Things. Alcibiades being preſs'd, anſwers, that he'll ſpeak when the Athenians deliberate on their Affairs. The Matter then in Queſtion, is how to explain] what is meant by the Affairs of the Athenians. Alcibiades fays, tis Peace and War, and all that belongs to the higheſt Politicks. Then, it muſt be (replies Socrates) when they ate conſidering with whom, and at what time tis beſtto be at Peace, or War. But as Maſters in all Arts and Sciences ſeek what is beſt and moſt convenient, ſo in Peace and War, that ought to be ſought out which is beſt and moſt advantageous, that is to ſay, moſt Juſt; and in order to find it, *tis neceſſary to _ know in what theſe conſiſt. In what then do they conſiſt? Alcibiades knows not what to anſwer. How ! (lays Socrates,) Are you going to the Aſſembly of the Athenians to give *em your Advice about- Peace and War, and yet know not why War or Peace ſhould be made? Alcibiades anſwers, that War is made, either to repel ſome Inſult, or to recover ſome Good. | This is ſomething(fays Socrates)but*tis not all. For tis necelſary to know, whether the Evil that is done us, is done juſtly or unjuſtly; on this Knowledgede- | pends the knowledge of what is beſt and moſt advan- tageous ; that which is Beſt being always moſt Juſt. So that on theſe Matters we ought to have an exact Knowledge of Juſtice, and to keep it always in view; and this is a thing of which you are ignorant, for of whom ſhould you have learn'd it? Lot Juſtice (replies A/c:b:ades) may be known without a Maſter. . 4110 093 Ves, ſuys Socrates, provided it be ſought after: But no Man ſeeks for what he thinks he knows; and at every Degree of our Age we think we know what Juſtice is, becauſe we ſpeak of it throughout the whole | Firſt Alcibiades. 301 whole courſe of our Life, and nothing is more com- mon than to hear Children complaining of the Wrongs and Injuries that are done em. So that we continually ſpeak of Juſtice without having learn'd what it is either of our ſelves or others, and conſe- - [quently without knowing it: | : Alcibrades thinks to extricate himſelf out of this Difficulty by ſaying he learn'd it of the People. Thats a very bad Maſter, ſays Socrates, how ſhould the People teach what they know not themſelves ? They have no Knowledge of Juſtice but by their Prejudices, as you have; and one certain ſign that they are ignorant of it, is, that they are always at nariance on this Subject, and that tis this difference alone that cauſes the Wars that deſolate the World. for if the People would agree about what is Juſt, and Unjuſt, they would always live in Peace. Alcibiades endeavours to get rid of this Difficulty, in ſay ing that *tis rarely deliberated in Councils whe- ther a thing is Juſt or Unjuſt, but only whether it be Uſeful ; for Juſtice and Utility (ſays he) are not al- ways the ſame things : Seeing ſome notorious Acts flajuſtice have been very advantageous; and a great many Perſons have been deſtroy'd for having acted juſtly. Which is too true a Draught of the Poli- ticks of moſt Princes. Socrates refutes this miſchie- rous Opinion, and ſhews, that an Action can't be uſeful and advantageous, unleſs it be Comely and Juſt. He firſts tells him, he could prove to him, by the ſame Arguments that he had us'd, that he knows not what is uſeful any more than he does what is juſt, fnce he had neither learn'd it of any one, nor found it out of himſelf; But not to oftend a Perſon fo nice and tender; (for Alcibiades being accuſtom d to the diverſified and florid Diſcourſes of the Sophiſts, did not like to hear the ſame thing twice, but lov'd Change and Variety in Language as well as in his Clothes) Socrates takes another Courſe, and asks him, if that which is Comely or Hononrable is always | 500d, or whether it ſometimes ceaſes to be ſo. 191411 | Ti 0 | Alcibiades 302 An Abridgient of the Alcibiades anſwers, that there are Comely and Ho- norable Thi | ample, in a Battle, when a Man ſuccours his Friend and is kill'd in the Action, this Action is Honourable but *tis Fatal.

Socrater anlwers, that the ſuccour a Man gives his Friend is, that which is call'd Valour, which is a thing quite different from Death, and that there: tore theſe ought to be conſider d ſeperately. So that the Queſtion is whether Valour bea Good or an Evil: Aleibiades anſwers, that tis a great Good, and that he would not preſerve His Life upon the Condition of being a Coward. 1 Then(ſays Socrates) vou confeſs that Cowardiſe isa greater Evil than Death: So that Valour is a greater Good than Life, and conſequently the Action of ſuccouring one's Friend is good, conſider d as abſtracted from all its conſequences; if it is Good it is Honour- able, and it can't be Honourable, without being uſe- ful; for whatſoever is Comely is Good, and that which is Gocd is Uſeful; there being nothing that is Comely and Honourable that can be Evil ſo far as it is Honourable ; nor any thing which is Shameful, chat can be Good ſo far as it is Shameful , which he proves by this invintible Argument: Thoſe that do good Actions are happy: Men can't be happy but by the Poſſeſſion of Good; the Poſſeſſion of Good isthe Confequence of a good Life; therefore Happineſs - neceſſarily attends thoſe that do bod Actions; ſo that Happineſs is 4 Comely and Honoutable Thin and confequently that which is good, that which is comely, and thiat which is uſetat; are never diffe- rent one from another. Therefore Juſtice being Come- ly and Good can't be oppos d to Urility: Atcibiades not only giants all theſe Truths; butis the Perfon that affirms em; for he is convint d by himſelf, and tis himſelf that makes the Anſwes.

Whereas you Alcibiades, have been brought up by a vile Thraci- an Slave, who was good for no other Office, becauſe of his extream old Age. As for Riches, there is ſtill as great a Diſproportion ; the Lacedemonians being richer than all Greece together, and yer hav- ing an Eſtate but like that of a private Man in com- pariſon of the King of Per/fia. In fine (ſays he) there is ſo great a diſparity in every thing, between theſe Kings and you, that if one ſhould go and tell the Mother of King Agzs, or the Mother of Artax- erxes, that a Citizen of Azhens, nam'd Alcibiades, was preparing to go and make War in their Coun- i, they would certainly imagine that long Exer- cle, great Experience, and a conſummate Wiſdom had inſpir'd you with ſo great a Deſign.

Hie your to become good. He anſwers, that tis in doing PA thoſe things which the beſt Cirizens ought to do, The beſt Citizens (he ſays) are thoſe whom we call wiſe and prudent ; and Wiſdom and Prudence are neceſſary to all Arts: Thus the Anſwer of A. cibiades is yet too indefinite. Who then are the beſt Citizens? Alcibiades again anſwers, that they are thoſe who know how to command Men that live under the ſame Government, who murually affift each other; but what is this Science that teaches how to command Men who make one and the ſame Political Body, and what is its end? Alc:brades ſays *tis good Counſel, and that the end of governing well is to procure the Welfare of the People. Socrates asks him what oughr to be done to g- vern a State well. Azc:brades anſwers, that Amity and Concord ſhould be made to reign in it. The Queſtion then is what Art produces this Ami- ty or Concord in States. A/cibrades anſwers, that this is breught about when every Man minds his own Buſineſs. nw This is not a ſufficient Anſwer, and Socrates re- futes it with a great deal of Addreſs and uy; g | J Firſt Alcibiades. Band by ſhowing that when every Man orfly minds his own Affairs, Amity can't be among 'em, becauſe there's no Concord. For how ſhould they accord about things which are known to ſome of *em, and unknown to others ? 9 Alcibiades is fo embarraſs'd that he is oblig'd to deny a Truth which he had before acknowledg'd. and to confeſs, that when the Citizens do that which is 555 yet they can't tell how to love one a- nother. He does not ſee what Socrates aims at: His Defign is to ſhew, that when Men only mind their Aﬀairs, they take care only of what belongs to themſelves, and ſo confine themſelves to the knowledg of particular things, and don't aſcend to that of the Eſſence of univerſal things, the onl knowledg that produces Charity the Mother of U- nion and Concord: Whereas the knowledg only of particular things, produces Diſorder and Diviſion. So that to make Concord reign in a State, tis not. enough that every one takes care of what appertains to himſelf, he muſt alſo take care of himſelt ; theſe being twyo very different Arts. For the Art by which we take care of our ſelves is not the ſame with that by which we take care of that which appertains to us. Now to take care of one's ſelf is to know one's ſelf: But what is it to know one's ſelf? Juſt as an Artificer uſes his Tools, ſo a Man makes uſe of his Body. So that the Body is not the Man, for the Body can't uſe and govern it ſelf. Nor is the Compound the Man, for if one of the things of which we are compounded does not govern, tis impoſſible they ſhould govern both together: And _ conſequently, fince neither the Body, nor the com- pound of Soul and Body together are the Man, it muſt be the Soul alone: Tis then only neceſſary that we know the Soul, and take care of that, if we would become truly wiſe. For to take care of our Bodies is to take care of what belongs to us; but ro take care of our Souls is to take care of our ſelves; to be employed with the _ of amaſling Riches, is 2 | © — — . . er AS 7 Into nr — — 5 108 An Abridgment of the to beemploy'd about things ſtill more remote than thoſe thar appertain to us. Thus they who love Alcibrades his Body, don't love Alcibiades himſelf, I F. bur that which belongs to Al/cibrades. To love AL ta cibiades is to love his Soul, to love that which is him- 1 7< ſelf, and not that which belongs ro him. There. 1 © fo ſee thoſe that love only his Body.retire f W. ore we ſee thoſe that love only his Body retire from I h. him when the Beauty of this Body is tedi;.g ; and : thoſe who love his Soul, do not ceaſe co love him + as long as he is vertuous, and labour by this Means ry to render himſelf as lovely as poi. le; aud this th (ſays Socrates) is the Cauſe ot the Inconitancy of my Rivals, and of my Steadinels. But what muſt we do to come to the ſight and 1 knowledg of our Souls? Socrates ſpeaks divinely 0 to Alcibiades on this occaſion. As our Eye, (ſays y he) can't ſee it ſelf but in the Objects that repre- ſent it, or in another Eye; that is, in that part of the Eye, which is the moſt excellent, namely that 9 wherein the Sight is: So the Soul to ſee and know : it ſelf; muſt view it ſelf in that part of the Soul in : which Wiſdom and Vertue are generated, or rather 0 in that Soul, of which ours is but the Image, and 8 in which Wiſdom, Vertue and Prudence are found J. in their ſovereign Perfection, that is, in God. For lo *tis by this meansonly that the Soul can know God, and her Selt, which is true Wiſdom. When ſhe * knows her ſelf, ſhe'll alſo know what belongs to er; for we muſt firſt know our Selves before we \ can know what belongs to us. She'll ikewiſe know D whatever reſpects the things that belong to her, and | what reſpects the things that belong to others. For h one Art is ſufficient for all this, and this Art is the b true ſort of Prudence. | s He therefore that is ignorant of himſelf, is igno- in rant of that which appertains both to himſelf and o- 2 thers, and not knowing what belongs to others, he be knows not what belongs to the Commonwealth, and conſequently can't be a good Miniſter of State. Nay | he is nof capable to govern a Family, nor ſo much as | as | ww Firſt Alcibiades. to conduct himſelf, for becauſe he is ignorant, tis im- poihible but he muſt commit faults; in commiting faults, he does ill, in doing ill he is miſerable, and 3090 renders thoſe miſerable who obey him. Thus he who is not wiſe or prudent cannot be happy, and he who is wicked can't but be miſerable. So that the happineſs of a City depends neither on its Riches, nor the ſtrength of its Fortifications, nor the great number of its Troops, nor its Galleys, nor the magni- ficence of its Arſenals, but on Vertue, without which there is nothing but Miſery in the World. ; Therefore to govern a State well, tis neceſſary to rovide Vertue for thoſe that compoſe it, and to en- Jeavoun to communicate it to 'em. ſequently, A/cibiades, to ſatisſie your Ambition, you ought not to think of acquiring great Dominion and exorbitant Power, either for your ſelf, or your Re- And con- publick, but that Juſtice and Prudence for which you have ſo much occaſion. For while you, and others act juſtly and prudently, you'll pleaſe God, who is the Source of true Felicity; and you'll govern your ſelf after this Manner; if (as I juſt now told you) you conſtantly look upon the Deity, that Light in which alone you can know your ſelf and all that be- longs to you. But if you govern your ſelf unjuſtly, and turn away your Eyes from the * to unite your ſelf to dark Objects, you'll neither know your your ſelf at all, nor the things that belong to you: And your Actions will be nothing but Works of Darkneſs ; and the more Power you have, the more unhappy you'll be. Alcibiades can't diſſent from theſe great Truths. But Socrates does not ſtop here; but gives the finiſhing ſtroke to mortifie his Pride in asking him, whether it is not more for the Ad- vantage of thoſe who are not yet endued with Ver- tue, to obey ſuch as are betterthan themſelves, than to be abandon'd to their own Conduct : And (lays he) is not that which is moſt profitable molt beauritul, and that which is moſt beautiful moſt becoming, and ſutable? Alcibiades agrees to this. Then (lays X 2 Socra- — . a Aer — —— — if 310 An Abridgment of the Firſt Alcibiades.

Ocrates meets Alcibiades going into a Temple to pray, and ſeeing him very penſive, and with his Eyes fix d on the Earth, he asks him on what he was thinking. What ihould I think on? (replies Alcibiades very faintly) being more concern'd about his ambitious Deſigns than his Prayers. It muſt be on ſome very imporrant Matters, (fays Socrates) for Ince tis certain, that the Gods often hear our Pray- ers, there's nothing that requires more Prudence and Wiſdom than to pray well; fo as not to requeſt E- vils of em, while we think we are asking Goods; or not to ask Evils of em willingly and knowingly as Oedipus did, whom Euripides brings in Praying * 1 Children might decide their rights by the word. You tell me of a mad Man (ſays Alcibiades) does any Man, who is in his ſenſes make ſuch Prayers as thoſe to the Gods? — 1 Hereupon Socrates asks him if being mad is not oppos d to being Prudenr : If Men are not wile or fooliſh, as they are either in Health or Sick: for as there is no Medium between Health and Sickneſs, neither is there any between Wiſdom and Folly. To. which A/ciliades agrees. OR Es f Since Madneſs then is oppos'd to Wiſdom, ſays Socra- es, Folly and Madneſs are but one and the fame thing. \\ An Abridgment of the For one ſingle Subject can't have two contraries oppos d to it, and conſequently every Fool is Mad. And ſeeing there are always a thouſand Fools to one wiſe Man in the World, while we live in it we are among mad Men. 5 | Ihe only thing that can militate againſt this Prin- ciple, is that jt would be impoſſible to live among To great a Number of mad Men; and the wiſe, whoſe Number is but ſmall, could never eſcape their Fury, And yet wiſe Men live in Cities, therefore it ſeems not true to ſay they live with mad Men. This is what Socrates objects againſt the Truth which he has made A/cibiades acknowledge: But he reſolves this Difficulty in ſhewing that there are divers De. ces of Folly, as there are divers ſorts of Di ſeaſes: The Fever is a Diſeaſe, but every Diſeaſe is not the Fever. *Tis Juſt ſo with Folly. All mad Men are Fools, but all Fools are not mad. A Diſeaſe is a Genius which comprehends many Species. Folly or Imprudence in like manner comprehends many Spe- cies, which difter in degree. As Men have divided Arts and Trades among em, ſo they have ſhar'd Folly among themſelves too; thoſe who have the great. eſt ſhare of it are ſaid to be diſtracted and mad; and they who have ſomewhat leſs are call'd Fools and ſtupid. But becauſe Men ſeek to hide theſe Vices under ſpecious Names, they call the former Men of Magnanimity, and of great Spirit; and they call the others Simple, orelſe they ſay they are harmleſs Men, but have little Experience and much Youth. There are beſides theſe a multitude of Names with which all ſorts of Vice are diſguis d. Thenext Queſtion is in what Wiſdom and Folly confiſt. A wiſe Man is one that knows what ought to be ſaid and done, and a Fool is one that is igno- rant of both. But is he that is thus ignorant, in this Condition without knowing it? Yes certainly. 0 edipus, tor Inſtance (ſays Socrates) was in this Con- 41 dition when he made that Prayer which we ſpoke * others, of before; but we Thall find a great many x Second Alcibiades; 313 who without being tranſported with Anger like him will requeſt real Evils of God while they think they are asking real Goods. For as for Oedipus, if he did not ask for what was good neither did he think he ask'd it; whereas others do the contrary. To be- gin with your ſelf, Aleibiades: If the God to whom you are going to pray ſhould ſuddenly appear to you, and ask you, if you would not be willing to be King of the Athenians, of all Greece, nay of all Europe, or (if that ſeem'd too little for your Ambition) of the whole World, would you not be extremely pleas'd, and return home with abundance of Joy, as one who had receiv'd the greateſt Good in the World? Who would not he tranſported with ſuch a thing as this? (replies Alcibiades.) But (ſays Socrates) would you give your Life for the Empire of the Greeks, or that of all the Barbarians together ? No certainly (ſays Alcibiades) for then I could not enjoy it. But what if you could enjoy it, (continues Socrates) and this Enjoyment muſt needs prove fatal to you ? No (fays Alcibiades) I would not do it on that Condition. You ſee by this therefore(ſays Socrates) that it is not ſafe to defire or accept what we know not. How many Men after they have paſſionately deſir'd to be Kings, and have left no Stone unrurn'd to obtain their End ; have become the Sacrifices of their extra- vagant Ambition? The Story of Arehelaus King of Macedonia is yet freſh in Memory. He aſcended the Throne by his Crimes, and was aſſaſſinated by. his Favourite, who could not maintain himſelf in it a- bove 3 or 4 days ; but was murder'd by a third who was ambitious to fill the ſame Place. 4 But without looking after foreign 1 how many of the Generals of our Army have been condemn'd to Death in our own City! how many of em exil'd ! and how many others have we ſeen, who after they had paſ$'d through innumerable Dan- gers, Toils and Labours, have fallen in rhe midſt of their Triumphs, by the Calumnies of their Enemies! A great many other Perſons, after they have _ 314 ly deſird Children, have been very unhappy in ob. An Airidgment of the taining em. And thus it is with the reſt of our Defires ; and tho' nothing is more common than Inſtances of this kind, yet there s icarce any Man who would refuſe the Thing he defires, 1 God ſhould offer it to him, or who would ceaſe © ask it, if he were ſure to obtain it. And we may every Day ſee Perſons repencing their for- mer Prayers, and making ſuch as are qq e con- trary to em. Therefore we muſt acknowledg che Truth of what Homer ſays, viz. Thr nothing is more unjuſt than the Complaints Men make a- gainſt the Gods, whom thzy accuſe ot beit g the the Cauſe of their M:ſeries, whereas they are the occaſion of em themſelves, who by their Folly draw down Miſchieis on their own Heads, which were not defign'd for em. A great Poet who knew the Ignorance of Man- kind upon this Account, endeavour'd to cure it by iving em this Prayer, which I think is an admira- ble one. Great God, who knowef? betier than me what is neceſſary for us, give ws the ood things we need, whether we ask em or not; and keep evil things from us, even when we ask em 4 thee. Then Ignorance is a very fatal thing (fays A/c: biades) ſeeing it changes our Prayers into Curſes, and prompts us to beg of God our own Miſeries. Hold a little, ſays Socrates, don't condemn Igno- Tance in General; if one ſort of it is pernicious, there's another that is very uſeful. For inſtance, would not Oreſtes have been happy if he had not known his Mother, when he ſought after her to kill her? For if he had not knowit her, he had not kill'd her, his deſign being only againſt her. So that this kind of Ignorance would have been very good for him: There is an Ignorance then (ſays he) which ought to be commended ; and this he proves with reat Evidence. And now he lays down this as a *rinciple, that all the Sciences in the World with-. but that by which we know what is very good, are Second Alcibiades. foot only uſeleſs, but moſt commonly extremely dangerous.

Article: Example 6.2.2 Generation of Sodium Iodide Solutions

An aqueous sodium iodide solution (10 mg/mL) was prepared by dissolving 250 mg of sodium iodide in 25 mL of water. Samples of this solution were diluted to 1 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL by serial dilutions. Aliquots of these solutions were then dosed into individual reaction to achieve the desired levels of sodium iodide identified in Table 19.
Example 6.2.3 Hydrogenation

Individual reaction vials (8 mL) were charged with a noroxymorphone stock solution (5 mL, 570 mg noroxymorphone) followed by 5% palladium on carbon (43 mg, 7.5 wt %, Johnson Matthey Type A101002-5). To these mixtures were added sodium iodide solutions of varying concentration. Hydrogenation reactions were then run under identical reducing conditions (80° C., 517 kPa H₂, 18 h) on a Parallel Hydrogenation apparatus. Samples of each reaction mixture (215 μL) were diluted to 20 mL with 0.085% aqueous H₃PO₄ then analyzed by HPLC as described above in Example 1.2. where the area under the peaks of Impurity 3 and noroxymorphone were determined. The Impurity 3 peak area % and the noroxymorphone peak area % were determined as described in Example 6.1. above. The results are summarized below in Table 19.

 For this screening study, only levels of noroxymorphone versus the ring-opened 3,4,14-trihydroxymorphinan-6-one (Impurity 3) were compared. Sodium iodide levels of at or above 200 ppm were shown to suppress formation of Impurity 3 to levels≦0.2%. The effect of sodium iodide on levels of ring-opening were evident at sodium iodide loadings of at or above 10 ppm, albeit to a lesser extent at below 200 ppm. As can be noted from the results presented in Table 19, very low levels of sodium iodide (5 ppm) seemed to have no significant effect on suppression of Impurity 3 formation.
 Example 6.3 Ring Opening in the Presence of Chloride

Four separate pressure vessels were charged with purified noroxymorphone (25.00 g), water (122 g) and 85% aqueous H₃PO₄ (20.66 g). To three of the reaction mixtures was added either ammonium chloride (2.73 g, 0.05 mol, sodium chloride (2.98 g, 0.05 mol) or 37% hydrochloric acid (4.64 mL, 0.05 mol). The fourth vessel was used as a control with no additional chloride added. A 5% palladium on carbon catalyst (1.88 g, 7.5 wt %, Johnson Matthey Type A101002-5) was then added to each vessel and the mixtures were heated to and kept at 80° C. under a hydrogen pressure of 517 kPa for 18 hours. The hydrogenation reaction products were cooled to a temperature of about 25° C., and a sample was removed by syringe and filtered using a 0.45 μm filter cartridge. A sample of the filtrate (215 μL) was diluted to 20 mL with 0.085% aqueous H₃PO₄ then analyzed by HPLC as described above in Example 1.2. where the area under the peaks of Impurity 3 and noroxymorphone were determined. The Impurity 3 peak area % and the noroxymorphone peak area % were determined as described in Example 6.1. above except that the total area of all of the observed HPLC peaks was used in place of [Impurity 3 peak area+noroxymorphone peak area]. The results are summarized below in Table 20.

As shown in Table 20, addition of equimolar amounts of chloride seemed to have a nearly identical effect on the suppression of the formation of Impurity 3 and the effect was independent of the source of chloride (e.g., NH₄Cl, NaCl or HCl).
 Example 6.4 Ring-Opening in the Presence of Different Amounts of Sodium Chloride

Separate pressure vessels were charged with purified noroxymorphone (25.00 g), water (122 g) and 85% aqueous H₃PO₄ (20.66 g). Sodium chloride was then added to each vessel at 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 or 11.9 weight % based on the noroxymorphone charged. A control with no added sodium chloride was also run. A 5% palladium on carbon catalyst (1.88 g, 7.5 wt %, Johnson Matthey Type A101002-5) was then added to each vessel and the mixtures were heated to and kept at 80° C. under a hydrogen pressure of 517 kPa for 18 hours. The hydrogenation reaction products were cooled to a temperature of about 25° C., and a sample was removed by syringe and filtered using a 0.45 μm filter cartridge. A sample of the filtrate (215 μL) was diluted to 20 mL with 0.085% aqueous H₃PO₄ then analyzed by HPLC analysis as described above in Example 1.2. where the area under the peaks of Impurity 3 and noroxymorphone were determined. The Impurity 3 peak area % and the noroxymorphone peak area % were determined as described in Example 6.1. above except that the total area of all of the observed HPLC peaks was used in place of [Impurity 3 peak area+noroxymorphone peak area]. The results are summarized below in Table 21.
 TABLE 21 Effect of Chloride Anion Concentration on Suppression of Impurity 3 Compound or Impurity wt. % NaCl (Peak Area %) 0 1.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 11.9 Noroxymorphone 89.64 97.52 98.41 98.72 98.75 98.81 Impurity 3 7.33 0.78 0.27 0.10 0.10 0.06

As shown in Table 21, the addition of NaCl suppresses the formation of Impurity 3. In comparison to iodide (see results using sodium iodide presented in Table 19 above), chloride is less effective in suppressing Impurity 3 and larger quantities of chloride are required to obtain comparable results.
Example 7 Conversion of Noroxymorphone to Naloxone

Noroxymorphone containing about 15 ppm of 14-hydroxymorphinone was converted to naloxone in 70% yield (98.1% by weight) containing about 6 ppm 7,8-didehydronaloxone (Impurity 4) as summarized in Scheme 13 below.
 A 500 mL jacketed reactor was charged with noroxymorphone containing 15 ppm 14-hydroxymorphinone (50.00 g, 0.174 mol, 1.0 equiv), sodium bicarbonate (23.39 g, 0.278 mol, 1.6 equiv.) and iso-propanol/tetrahydrofuran (60 IPA:40 THF v/v, 325.4 mL). The water content of the mixture was adjusted to 30 wt % with respect to the noroxymorphone charge by adding deionized water (about 15.2 mL). Allyl bromide (29.48 g, 0.243 mol, 1.4 equiv.) was added and the mixture was heated to and kept at 63±2° C. with stirring for a minimum of 10 h. The mixture was cooled to 5±5° C. and then the solids were removed by filtration. The filtrate was diluted with tetrahydrofuran (224.0 mL) and the mixture was transferred slowly to a boiling mixture of toluene (380.0 mL), water (92.0 mL) and sodium chloride (3.22 g). The solvents (iso-propyl alcohol and tetrahydrofuran) were removed by constant distillation and the liquid volume in the vessel was kept constant by addition of toluene. Upon completion of the filtrate transfer, the mixture temperature was adjusted to 80±5° C. while maintaining a continuous distillation.
 A solution of sodium chloride was added (1.0 M, 14.2 mL) and, after complete mixing, agitation was stopped and the residual aqueous layer was removed from the vessel by the bottom outlet valve (BOV). A fresh portion of sodium chloride solution (1.0 M, 28.5 mL) was added and the temperature of the mixture was adjusted to 80° C. Agitation was stopped and again the aqueous layer was removed from the vessel by the BOV. The remaining organic layer was heated to 110±2° C. while maintaining continuous distillation again keeping the initial volume constant by the addition of toluene. The mixture was then filtered hot (above 90° C.) and the resultant filtrate was transferred into a jacketed reactor. The mixture was then cooled over 5 hours to 60° C., and heptane (342.0 mL) was slowly added maintaining a temperature of about 60° C. The batch was held at 60° C. for 4 hours and then cooled to 10° C. at a rate of 8° C./min. The solids were filtered and dried to constant weight in a reduced pressure oven at 80° C. This yielded naloxone as a light beige solid (40.84 g, 70% yield). This material contained about 6 ppm Impurity 4 upon HPLC analysis as described in Example 1.3.
Example 8 Conversion of Naloxone to Naloxone Hydrochloride

For this experiment, naloxone containing about 7 ppm of 7,8-didehydronaloxone (Impurity 4) was converted to naloxone hydrochloride in 75% yield (99.9% by weight) containing about 8 ppm Impurity 4 as summarized in Scheme 14 below.
 Example 8.1 Initial Decolorization of Naloxone

A jacketed reactor was charged with naloxone containing about 7 ppm Impurity 4 (15.35 g) and iso-propanol (50.54 mL). This mixture was heated under nitrogen to reflux for 1 hour and then cooled to about 25° C. A mixture of butylated hydroxytoluene (0.15 g, 1 wt %) and activated carbon (Darco KB-WJ, 1.50 g, 10 wt %) in iso-propanol (11.72 mL) was then added. The reaction mixture was purged with nitrogen (14-21 kPa) for 10 minutes, heated to 75° C. and held at 75° C. for 1 hour while maintaining the nitrogen purge (14-21 kPa). This mixture was pressure filtered at 80° C. through a 1.2 μm polypropylene filter. A mixture of butylated hydroxytoluene (0.15 g, 1 wt %) and activated carbon (Darco KB-WJ, 1.51 g, 10 wt %) in iso-propanol (10.4 mL) was added to the filtrate and the above decolorization process was repeated. The carbon cake was washed with 11.4 mL of iso-propanol and the resultant filtrate was used directly in Example 8.2. as described below.
 Example 8.2 Salt Formation and Isolation

Degassed water (13.1 mL) was added to the resultant filtrate from Example 8.1. above and the mixture was purged with nitrogen (14-21 kPa) for 10 minutes and then heated to 75° C. while maintaining the nitrogen purge (14-21 kPa). Hydrochloric acid (37%, 1.10 equiv.) was slowly added to the mixture keeping the temperature below 80° C. Upon complete addition, the HCl addition line was rinsed with 3.5 mL of degassed water, the mixture was cooled to 67° C. and naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate seed crystals (0.12 g) were charged to the mixture. The batch was then cooled to 55° C. at a rate of 2° C./h, held at this temperature for 5 hours and then further cooled over 8 hours to −10° C. The solids were isolated by filtration and the resultant wet cake was washed with iso-propanol:water (85:15, 12° C., 15.0 mL). The solids were then dried to constant weight at a temperature of about 25° C. under reduced pressure. This yielded naloxone hydrochloride as a white crystalline solid (14.0 g, 75% yield) in 99.9% purity, as determined by HPLC, containing 8 ppm 7,8-didehydronaloxone hydrochloride, determined by HPLC as described above in Example 1.3.
Example 9 Conversion of Noroxymorphone to Naltrexone

Noroxymorphone was converted to naltrexone as summarized in Scheme 15 below.
Two experiments were conducted: one using purified noroxymorphone, purified as described above, as the starting material and the second using noroxymorphone starting material to which Impurity 1 was deliberately added. Each experiment is described below.
 Example 9.1 Naltrexone Prepared from Purified Noroxymorphone

Cyclopropylmethyl bromide (5.29 g, 39.2 mmol, Minakem LLC, Hackensack, N.J.) and triethylamine (3.63 g, 35.9 mmol, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.) were added to a suspension of purified noroxymorphone (11.01 g, 38.3 mmol, Rhodes Technologies, Coventry, R.I.) in a 10:1 mixture of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone:water (vol.:vol., 36.3 mL) in a 250 mL reaction vessel. The purified noroxymorphone, purified as described in one of the examples above, contained <10 ppm Impurity 1. The vessel was purged with nitrogen and the reaction mixture was heated to 70° C. and kept at that temperature for 2 hours. Then, additional triethylamine (3.63 g, 35.9 mmol) was added. After 1 more hour at that temperature, additional cyclopropylmethyl bromide (1.11 g, 8.3 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours more at 70° C. A sample of the reaction mixture was taken for HPLC analysis that indicated about 1.1% of the noroxymorphone starting material remained. Maintaining the mixture at about 70° C., water (165 mL) was then added drop-wise. This resulted in the formation of an oil which formed a gum upon cooling to a temperature of about 25° C. The reaction liquors were decanted off and the gum was dissolved in acetonitrile (22 mL). Water (100 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (2×75 mL/extraction). The combined extracts were dried (Na₂SO₄), filtered, and concentrated to dryness to provide 7.29 g of naltrexone as a light brown solid (56% yield).
 Analysis was performed by HPLC as described in Example 1.4. The levels of naltrexone (95.1 area %, 89.5 wt. %) and 3-cyclopropylmethyl naltrexone (2.5 wt. %) in the reaction product were determined. The weight percent assay was below the expected value of about 100% probably because of the presence of residual N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent. The HPLC analysis also determined that the reaction product contained about 18 ppm of the ABUK 7,8-didehydronaltrexone (designated as “Impurity 6”).
Example 9.2 Naltrexone Prepared from Noroxymorphone Containing Added Impurity 1

As a check on the above experimental procedure and analysis, Example 9.1. was repeated under substantially identical conditions except Impurity 1 (25 mg, 0.088 mmol, Rhodes Technologies; this corresponds to a level of about 2270 ppm of Impurity 1) was deliberately added to and present with the starting purified noroxymorphone. The sample of the reaction mixture taken for HPLC analysis indicated that about 1.3% of the noroxymorphone starting material remained. After the combined extracts were dried (Na₂SO₄), filtered, and concentrated to dryness, 7.95 g of naltrexone was obtained as a light brown solid (61% yield). Analysis by HPLC as described in Example 1.4. determined the levels of naltrexone (95.2 area %, 82.0 wt. %) and 3-cyclopropylmethyl naltrexone (2.2 wt. %) in the reaction product. As above, the weight percent assay was below the expected value of about 100% probably because of the presence of residual N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent. The HPLC analysis also determined that the reaction product contained 1821 ppm of the Impurity 6 ABUK.

I have the following problem. 
I have like 20K xlsx files and want to put them into one workingsheet, which is working quite well right now.
Each xlsx file has a specific string. 
For instance:

Test_a_LME.xlsx 
Test_a_KZE.xlsx  
Test_b_LME.xlsx
Test_a_KZE.xlsx 

and so on..
What I want now is that I add a string (Range until the lastrow of data in each file) based on the ending of the file (LME & KZE) (Please see the picture)

This is my code so far:

Sub XlsMerger()
Dim bookList As Workbook
Dim mergeObj As Object, dirObj As Object, filesObj As Object, everyObj As Object
Dim myFile As String

Application.ScreenUpdating = False


Set mergeObj = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
'Change folder path of excel files here
Set dirObj = mergeObj.getfolder("Folder")
Set filesObj = dirObj.Files
Set fldr = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFolderPicker)

For Each everyObj In filesObj
    Set bookList = Workbooks.Open(everyObj)

    bookList.Activate
    Range("A4:A" & Range("A65536").End(xlUp).Row).Copy
    ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Activate
    Range("A65536").End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0).PasteSpecial (xlPasteValuesAndNumberFormats)

    bookList.Activate
    Range("D4:E" & Range("D65536").End(xlUp).Row).Copy
    ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Activate
    Range("D65536").End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0).PasteSpecial (xlPasteValuesAndNumberFormats)

    bookList.Activate
    Range("B4:B" & Range("B65536").End(xlUp).Row).Copy
    ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Activate
    Range("F65536").End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0).PasteSpecial (xlPasteValuesAndNumberFormats)

Application.CutCopyMode = False
bookList.Close
Next
End Sub

I am pretty sure that I need to add probably an if statement into the for loop but I dont know exactly how this could look like.
Thanks for the help in advance!!

Would you expect the A,B and D columns to contain the same number of rows?  Seems like if one of those was different from the others then that might cause your compiled data to become mis-aligned.

@TimWilliams A, B and D will always have the exact number of rows :)

Untested:
Sub XlsMerger()
    Dim bookList As Workbook, fldr As Object
    Dim mergeObj As Object, dirObj As Object, filesObj As Object, everyObj As Object
    Dim myFile As String, lastRow As Long, wsTarget As Worksheet, rwTarget As Range

    Application.ScreenUpdating = False


    Set mergeObj = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    'Change folder path of excel files here
    Set dirObj = mergeObj.getfolder("Folder")
    Set filesObj = dirObj.Files
    Set fldr = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFolderPicker)

    Set wsTarget = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1)
    Set rwTarget = wsTarget.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0).EntireRow

    For Each everyObj In filesObj

        Set bookList = Workbooks.Open(everyObj)

        With bookList.Sheets(1)
            'find last row using ColA
            lastRow = .Cells(.Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row

            'then use that same last row value to copy the 3 columns
            .Range("A4:A" & lastRow).Copy
            rwTarget.Columns("A").PasteSpecial xlPasteValuesAndNumberFormats

            .Range("D4:D" & lastRow).Copy
            rwTarget.Columns("D").PasteSpecial xlPasteValuesAndNumberFormats

            .Range("B4:B" & lastRow).Copy
            rwTarget.Columns("F").PasteSpecial xlPasteValuesAndNumberFormats

            'fill in the filename info: make adjustments here as needed
            rwTarget.Columns("B").Resize(lastRow - 3, 1).Value = bookList.Name

        End With

        Set rwTarget = rwTarget.Offset(lastRow - 3, 0) 'offset for next paste

        Application.CutCopyMode = False
        bookList.Close
    Next
End Sub


You need to determine the position of the LAST underscore in the filename, then get the three MIDDLE characters of that filename string, starting one character past the underscore.
Option Explicit

Sub test()
    Dim fn As String
    fn = "Test_a_LME.xlsx"
    Dim pos1 As Long
    pos1 = InStrRev(fn, "_") + 1
    Debug.Print Mid$(fn, pos1, 3)
End Sub


Thanks for the answer. The problem which is way more bothering is to fill the cells ones I determined the name of the file.

ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes how wineries in the wine industry cluster of Baja California in Mexico achieve a high-performance level and engage in technology management. The study uses the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative
analysis approach to inquire into the necessary and sufficient conditions for firms in this industry cluster to attain
a high-performance level. Our research hypothesis suggests that the presence of some resources (conditions)
in the wine industry cluster of Baja California is a necessary and sufficient condition (set-theoretic relations) to
achieve a high-performance level (outcome). Accordingly, this study examines the causal complexity observed in
set-theoretic relations and high-performance levels in the wine industry cluster of Baja California. An important
finding in this research is that winery firms in Baja California do not need to develop interdependent innovations
to achieve a high-performance level. However, research and development efforts, good supplier relations, and
production capacity are necessary conditions to achieve a high performance level in this cluster.

FSQCA APPROACH | José Carlos Rodríguez | Mario Gómez | María Aline Manzo

INTRODUCTION

this study is as follows: which are the necessary and sufficient
conditions (set-theoretic relations) among winery firms in
the wine industry cluster of Baja California that allow a highperformance level (outcome) to be achieved? In this sense,
fsQCA methods offer insight into how firms may develop a
competitive market advantage (Porter, 1997, 1998a; Porter &
Stern, 2001).
In their 2012 paper entitled “Is Baja California, Mexico,
wine industry a cluster?” Trejo-Pech, Arellano-Sada, Coelho,
and Weldon (2012) ask whether the winery region of Baja
California in Mexico can be considered a wine industry
cluster. These authors concluded that Baja California must
be considered a successful industry cluster (Trejo-Pech et al.,
2012). Accordingly, the theoretical perspective adopted in
this research is the industry cluster approach (Porter, 1998a,
1998b).
 The wine industry in Mexico is made up of more than
216 wineries and 70 commercializing companies (GóngoraRosado, 2016). Wine grapes are grown on 6,474 hectares
of vineyards in 11 Mexican states (El Universal, 2018a;
González-Andrade, 2015). However, Baja California is the
most important producer of grapevines, accounting for around
60% (3,735 hectares) of the total vineyards cultivated in
Mexico (González-Andrade, 2015). A Mediterranean climate
makes Baja California the region best suited to produce highquality grapes, supplying more than 85% of total Mexican
wine through 350 wine labels and 2 million cases equivalent
to a value of 378 million Mexican pesos (Consejo Mexicano
Vitivinícola [CMV], 2018; González-Andrade, 2015; Secretaria
de Fomento Agropecuario [SEFOA], 2011). Ensenada, Tecate,
and Tijuana are the most important wine-producing locations
in Baja California, where numerous wineries and other
supporting firms make up the region’s wine industry cluster
(González-Andrade, 2015; Trejo-Pech et al., 2012).
The objective of this research is thus to reveal the
necessary and sufficient conditions (set-theoretic relations)
to achieve a high-performance level (outcome) among
winery firms in the wine industry cluster of Baja California.
Winemaking has a long history in Mexico. It is considered the
oldest wine-growing region in North America, dating back to
1522 when grapevines were introduced from Spain (Bringas
& González, 2004; Covarrubias & Thach, 2015; Meraz-Ruiz,
2015). Nevertheless, the earliest Mexican wines were crafted
in 1707, but it was only a few years ago that Mexico started
producing, advertising, and marketing wine (Covarrubias &
Thach, 2015; Wines of Baja, 2013). Nowadays, several civil
associations in Mexico are related to wine production and
allied with the International Wine Organization (IWO) to support
the production and promotion of high-quality wine (GonzálezAndrade, 2015).
 The viticulture in Baja California is an example of how
Mexican wineries have developed a high-quality and competitive
industry with international recognition (Góngora-Rosado, 2016;
Meraz-Ruiz, 2015). However, the viticulture in Mexico continues
to be mostly a regional and small-scale industry, with Mexico
ranking as the 25th-largest wine producer in the world (GarcíaFernández, Meraz-Ruiz, & Díaz-Gómez, 2018; Góngora-Rosado,
2016; González-Andrade, 2015). It is Mexico’s climate that makes

The research method adopted in this study is the fuzzyset qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) that allows
integrating into the same analysis qualitative and quantitative
methods (set-theoretic relations) that generate a specific
outcome (Berger, 2016; Parente & Federo, 2019; Ragin, 2008;
Rihoux & Ragin, 2009). The fsQCA approach also contributes
to revealing the complex causality between conditions in a
small number of cases through determining the necessary
and sufficient conditions (set-theoretic relations) that
generate a specific outcome (Ragin, 2000, 2008). The research
hypothesis is specified in a configurational manner by
developing substitution and complementarity logics among
conditions that produce the outcome of interest (Parente &
Federo, 2019). Therefore, the research question examined in

it possible to produce high-quality wine and positions Mexico as
an outstanding wine producer and competitor in international
markets (Góngora-Rosado, 2016; Meraz-Ruiz, 2015). Examples
of successful wine producers in Baja California are L.A. Cetto,
Casa Domecq, Bodegas de Santo Tomás, and Monte Xanic
(Covarrubias & Thach, 2015). Indeed, the five-largest wineries
from this region account for more than 15% of Mexican wine
production (Covarrubias & Thach, 2015). Mexican wineries
exported 500,000 cases of wine in 2018, notably to Belize (2%),
Canada (4%), Denmark (1%), France (1%), Japan (30%), the
United States (51%), and the United Kingdom (2%) (Milenio,
2018). Japan and the United States are the most important
markets for Mexican wine. Figure 1 shows Mexico’s wine exports
by country of destination.

The Consejo Mexicano Vitivinícola (Mexican Board of
Wine, CMV) has emphasized the importance of the Mexican wine
industry in recent years with a growth equivalent to 8% of the
total world wine production in 2017 and a remarkable increase
in demand in national and international markets (El Conocedor,
2016; García-Fernández et al., 2018)
Grapevine farming is practiced in 11 Mexican states,
namely, Aguascalientes, Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila,
Guanajuato, Nuevo León, Puebla, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí,
Sonora, and Zacatecas (Figure 2) (El Universal, 2018a; MerazRuiz & Ruiz Vega, 2016) over a total of 6,474 hectares of
vineyards. Nevertheless, 97% out of total grapevine production
is concentrated in Aguascalientes, Baja California, Coahuila,
Guanajuato, Querétaro, and Zacatecas (Meraz-Ruiz & Ruiz Vega,
2016). Indeed, Baja California accounts for almost 60% of the
total vineyards cultivated in Mexico, equivalent to 3,735 hectares
(González-Andrade, 2015; Trejo-Pech et al., 2012). Furthermore,
Mexican wineries offer 350 wine labels and 2 million cases,
equivalent to 2.5 million liters of wine a year (El Universal, 2018a).
In 2017, Mexican wine production value was equivalent to 378
million Mexican pesos, while its commercialization value was
equivalent to 1,588 million Mexican pesos, and thus the Mexican
wine chain value was equivalent to 1,966 million Mexican pesos
during the same year (El Universal, 2018a).
 However, the main challenge to be addressed by
Mexican producers is threefold (Meraz-Ruiz & Ruiz-Vega, 2016):
environmental restrictions (e.g., insufficient water in vineyards),
the opportunity to get adequate inputs from abroad, and a high
concentration in the glass industry. Even if these are enormous
tasks, Mexican wine producers are currently offering high-quality
labels in national and international markets (García-Fernández

et al., 2018). Nevertheless, winery owners have proposed that
the Mexican government support the wine industry through an
adequate policy that includes tax discounts, sponsoring, and
subsidizing wine production, as well as establishing a regulatory
framework to promote, develop, and diffuse wine production
through supporting innovation activities (Diario Oficial de la
Federación [DOF], 2018; González-Andrade, 2015). Consequently,
the Mexican government passed the 2018 Ley de Fomento a la
Industria Vitivinícola (Act for the Promotion of the Wine Industry)
intended to support the competitiveness of Mexican wineries.
This initiative projected that wine production would rise by 50%
through an increase of 15,000 hectares of cultivated vineyards in
ten years (DOF, 2018; Industrial News Baja California [INBC], 2018).
Furthermore, the CMV works to standardize the quality of Mexican
wine made 100% with Mexican grapes. Finally, winemaking
in Mexico profits from soil minerality and salinity; grapevine
sweetness; and, crucially, environmental and legal conditions
that contribute to the competitiveness of this industry (GarcíaFernández et al., 2018; González-Andrade, 2015).

 Theoretical approaches on innovation policy
There are at least four theoretical approaches in the
literature on how innovation activity is carried out (Rinkinen &
Harmaakorpi, 2018):
•

The innovation systems perspective,

•

The smart specialization (SmSp) approach,

The industry cluster approach.
policy that follows from this perspective is intended to support
cooperation activities among firms within an ecosystem.
Finally, the industry cluster approach demonstrates how
firms within a geographic agglomeration may support innovation
activity to develop a competitive advantage (Porter, 1998a, 1998b,
2000a, 2000b). It considers the importance of several actors in
the process of developing innovation activities. The innovation
policy drawn from the industry cluster approach suggests that
firms within a cluster must compete and cooperate at the same
time. This theoretical approach will be discussed in more detail
in the next section.
However, each approach responds to specific questions in
the analysis of innovation (Rinkinen & Harmaakorpi, 2018). For
example, the innovation systems perspective studies innovation
as a systemic phenomenon at different levels of analysis: (i)
national (Freeman, 1987; Lundvall, 1992; Nelson, 1993), (ii)
regional (Cooke, 1992, 1998), and (iii) sectoral/technological
(Malerba, 2002). The innovation systems perspective offers
insight into how innovation activity is carried out when applying
alternative innovation policies (Edquist, 1997). From this
perspective, the linkages between information and knowledge
flows, investment funding, flows of authority, and networks of
partnerships must be included in the analysis (Cooke, 1998).
 However, market failures and other system imperfections must
be at the core of innovation systems analysis because of the
need to define suitable innovation policies (Asheim, Smith, &
Oughton, 2011; Cooke, 1998; Harmaakorpi, 2006; Jauhiainen,
2009; Smits & Kuhlmann, 2004).
The SmSp concept was primarily developed as an
alternative innovation policy approach, stressing the differences
between regions when such policies were implemented (e.g.,
Europe and the United States) (Camagni & Capello, 2013; Foray
& Ark, 2007; McCann & Ortega-Argilés, 2013). This perspective is
about a targeted use of funding and investment in fields with the
most promising innovation potential (e.g., new combinations of
resources, and new niches and cross-cutting fields of expertise)
(Rinkinen & Harmaakorpi, 2018). SmSp is based on the principles
of embeddedness, relatedness, and connectedness (Foray et al.,
2012). However, there is no universal innovation policy in the
SmSp approach but several independent innovation policies in

The industry cluster approach has evolved into a comprehensive
stream of literature. This trend arises because of the importance
given to clusters and local specialization in academic and political
analyses during the last few decades (Cruz & Teixeira, 2010).
Industry clusters are defined as “geographic concentrations of
interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field”
(Porter, 1998a, p. 78). This approach analyzes competitiveness
and innovation activity among a geographic agglomeration of firms
(Martin & Sunley, 2003; Porter, 1998a, 1998b, 2000a, 2000b). It
includes many actors and institutions, such as specialized inputs,
providers of specialized infrastructure, companies manufacturing
complementary products, government agencies, universities,
vocational and specialized training providers, and so forth (Porter,
1998a). Indeed, the interface between these interconnected
companies and institutions is commonly a source of competitive
advantage (Porter, 1998a).
 The cluster approach suggests that competitive advantage
is found where business units are based and different actors

order for each region to create its appropriate strategy, goals, and
action plan (Rinkinen & Harmaakorpi, 2018).
The business ecosystems perspective suggests that
innovative firms must be considered as part of an ecosystem
(Moore, 1993, 2006). An essential feature in this approach is that
firms simultaneously cooperate and compete to co-evolve when
developing innovations (Moore, 1993). Indeed, firms contribute to
the business ecosystem value network in which value is co-created
by all of them (Leviäkangas et al., 2014; Peppard & Rylander 2006).
Business ecosystems are defined as “a type of a business network,
a collaboration to create a system of complementary capabilities
and companies” (Moore, 2006). Indeed, there are four stages
when developing business ecosystems (Moore, 2006): birth,
expansion, leadership, and self-renewal or death. The innovation

and innovation activities are located (Porter, 2000a, 2000b;
Roelandt & Hertog, 1999). Therefore, clusters are formed to benefit
from knowledge spillovers, trust, and better coordination for
innovation (Maskell, 2001; Porter, 1998a). Indeed, cooperation
and competition within a cluster is the driving force determining
its dynamics (Bell, 2005; Padmore & Gibson, 1998; Porter, 1998a).
Competition increases productivity and innovation through
stimulating the formation of new firms, while cooperation
establishes the basis of the cluster development (Porter, 1998a).
 In this regard, firms within a cluster cooperate with other firms
typically through hierarchies, and the development of company
relationships contributes to diminishing competition when it
is necessary to determine long-run profits (Leavy, 1996; Porter,
1998a). Competition and cooperation can coexist because they

occur on different dimensions between different players (Porter,
1998a).
Finally, the innovation policy drawn from the industry
cluster approach stresses the importance of improving
productivity and regional economic growth (Porter, 1998b). It
seeks to guarantee the possibility of better conditions to access
employees, suppliers, specialized information, institutions and
public goods, perceptions of emerging buyer needs, innovation
opportunities, and so forth (Porter, 1998b, 2000a). Importantly,
the concept of industry cluster has not been exempted from some
criticisms concerning its definition, theorization, empirical inquiry,
and use in policy making (Martin & Sunley, 2003)

THE WINE INDUSTRY CLUSTER OF BAJA
CALIFORNIA
A well-known example of a wine industry cluster is California
(Porter, 1998a). This example shows how commercial wineries,
independent wine grape growers, suppliers of grape stock,
irrigation, harvesting equipment and barrel suppliers, and
specialized public relations and advertising firms are
interconnected through a network of complex linkages
(Porter, 1998a). However, there are many other examples in
the literature on wine industry clusters in the world (Trejo-Pech
et al., 2012): Baja California (Mexico), Barossa Valley (Australia),
Champagne and Bordeaux (France), Colchagua Valley (Chile),
Mendoza (Argentina), Napa Valley (United States), and Rioja
(Spain).
 The wine industry cluster of Baja California possesses
some specific features that make it rather different from
other clusters, mainly soil minerality and salinity, grapevine
sweetness, and environmental and legal conditions. These
features have allowed Baja California to gain an international
reputation for the quality of its wine (González-Andrade, 2015;
López, House, & Trejo-Pech, 2010; Trejo-Pech et al., 2012). Indeed,
the climate in Baja California particularly favors high-quality
crops, ensuring a successful industry cluster (SEFOA, 2011). It
is noteworthy that Ensenada, Tijuana, and Tecate are the most
important areas in the Baja California region, producing around
90% of Mexican wine from 150 winery firms of varying sizes,
and using different techniques (e.g., modern, handmade, and
craft techniques) (Alpízar-Padilla & Maldonado-Ávalos, 2009;
Quiñonez-Ramírez, Bringas-Rábago, & Barrios-Prieto, 2011;
Góngora-Rosado, 2016; SEFOA, 2011). Table 1 shows the main
grape varieties cultivated in Baja California (CMV, 2015; MerazRuiz, 2015).

Finally, the wine industry cluster of Baja California has
developed as highly competitive, characterized by some features
(OIV, 2010; Trejo-Pech et al., 2012):
•

Grapes are cultivated in a Mediterranean climate (e.g.,
Valle de Guadalupe).
•

There is a strong collaboration between winery firms and
other actors that generate collective knowledge.
•

There is a deep interaction between identifiable physical
and biological environments.
•

Some successful vitivinicultural practices have been
implemented.
 Indeed, these characteristics refer to the existence of a
highly competitive vitivinicultural terroir in this region, leading
Baja California winery firms to develop a competitive advantage
(OIV, 2010; Porter, 1997, 2008; Porter & Stern, 2001; Rodríguez,
Gómez, & Ramírez, 2015).

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

During recent years, scholars in the social sciences have been
increasingly interested in QCA applications and methods
(Schneider & Wagemann, 2010). Thus, QCA methods have
been modified, extended, and improved to answer scientific
questions, contributing to achieving further progress in the
social sciences (Berger, 2016; Huarng & Roig-Tierno, 2016;
Ragin, 2000, 2006, 2008; Ragin & Sonnett, 2004). The QCA
methodology is a comparative case−oriented approach that
allows the minimally necessary and/or minimal conditions to
bring about an outcome to be identified (Vis, 2012). It is an
approach based on set-theoretic relations and Boolean algebra
that combines qualitative and quantitative methods to gain
insight into the interactions of set memberships (Marx, Rihoux,
& Ragin, 2014; Parente & Federo, 2019; Ragin, 2000, 2008; RoigTierno, González-Cruz, & Llopis-Martínez, 2017). In this way,
the comparative case−oriented approach of QCA is capable
of establishing set-theoretic relations that enable theorizing
and examining the causal complexity of social phenomena
characterized by nonlinearities and asymmetries (Parente &
Federo, 2019; Rihoux & Ragin, 2009).
 The theoretical explanations in QCA are not about the net
effect of individual variables on an outcome (e.g., econometric
analysis) but the causal conditions on a desired state or outcome
(Radaelli & Wagemann, 2019). Therefore, causality in QCA is
understood as a complex, conjunctural, equifinal, and asymmetric
method based on set-theoretic relationships that make use of the
principles of necessary and sufficient conditions (Parente & Federo,
2019). This possibility allows us to unravel the causal complexity
characterizing social phenomena through analyzing multiple

There are three main approaches in QCA: crisp-set QCA
(csQCA), fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA), and multi-value QCA (mvQVA)
(Ragin, 2000, 2006, 2008; Roig-Tierno et al., 2017). Certainly,
QCA applications have evolved from using solely crisp sets into
incorporating fuzzy sets with more finely grained degrees of
membership (Parente & Federo, 2019). In particular, the fsQCA
approach gives qualitative comparative analysis the possibility of
managing several levels of membership when constructing logical
propositions (Ragin, 2000; Roig-Tierno et al., 2017). Hence, the
research questions typically raised in QCA concern the necessary
and/or sufficient conditions to achieve an outcome (Cotte & Pardo,
2013; Vis, 2012). The aim is, therefore, to find out the logical
connections between combinations of causal conditions that
bring about a desired state or outcome (Roig-Tierno et al., 2017).
In the case of fsQCA research, the inquiry procedure allows
the transformation of qualitative information into quantitative
values to discover the missing associations between independent
and dependent conditions, as well as provide a systematic
approach for data calibration and quantification of qualitative
fuzzy-set data (Fiss, 2007; Ragin, 2000, 2008; Roig-Tierno et
al., 2017; Schneider & Wagemann, 2010, 2012). Thus, the fsQCA
approach reveals how to deal with complexity among conditions,
typically in a small number of cases (Ragin, 2000, 2006, 2008).
 Importantly, even if QCA was initially developed to find consistent
relationships among small samples, it is also applied now to
samples ranging from small to large (Parente & Federo, 2019).
The application of fsQCA methods proceeds in four steps
(Marx et al., 2014; Ragin, 2006, 2008): (i) configurational model
design and calibration, (ii) development of raw and modified truth
tables, (iii) consistency analysis, and (iv) solution analysis. The
configurational model design and calibration process implies
transforming the explanatory conditions and outcome into settheoretic relations to build the raw and truth modified tables of

independent causal attributes associated with a given outcome
(conjunction), exploring different combinations of conditions
associated with an outcome (equifinality), and assessing the
possibility that the presence and the absence of attributes could
be associated to an outcome (asymmetry) (Parente & Federo,
2019). The basis of QCA is thus the study of the configurations
that consistently produce sufficient and necessary conditions
to generate a desired state or outcome (Parente & Federo, 2019;
Ragin, 2000, 2006, 2008; Roig-Tierno et al., 2017). Nowadays,
QCA methods have been used in several disciplines, such as
public policy and political science, business and management,
or even industrial engineering and computer sciences (Huarng
& Roig-Tierno, 2016; Marx et al., 2014; Mendel & Korjani, 2012,
2013; Roig-Tierno, Huarng, & Ribeiro-Soriano, 2016).
alternative configurations. This process allows the establishment
of the consistency cutoff to distinguish causal combinations that
are or are not part of the outcome that generates similar solutions
(Ragin, 2006, 2008). The solutions occur along the complexity and
parsimoniousness continuum in which the intermediate solution
is often the most interpretable (Ragin, 2006, 2008).
 It is essential to consider two additional concepts when
applying fsQCA methods (Roig-Tierno et al., 2017): consistency
and coverage. “Consistency” refers to the percentage of causal
configurations with an identical outcome, while “coverage”
(explanatory power or empirical relevance) refers to the number
of cases with a valid configuration (Marx et al., 2014; RoigTierno et al., 2017). Accordingly, this research aims to identify
the necessary and sufficient conditions leading winery firms to

complexity (causal ambiguity) of the interconnections between

a high-performance level.

explain this strategy. The internal conditions are R&D efforts (R&D),
specialized human capital (SHC), product and process innovation
(PPI), and production capacity (PC), while the external conditions
are good supplier relations (GSR), consumer satisfaction (CS),
good complementary relationships (GCR), and interdependent

asked about firm performance and other activities constituting the
configuration conditions that lead to a high-performance level. The
sample selection corresponded to the wineries' position in terms
of sales and production. Other information on the characteristics
featuring this cluster was collected from CMV sources (CMV, 2015,
2018). Therefore, data from wineries included firm size, hectares
of cultivated vineyards, annual case production, variety of vines,
labels, and product awards. Suitable cases needed to explain
the high-performance level among winery firms in this industry
cluster were included in the sample (Parente & Federo, 2019).

Source: From companies' interviews.
Even if the success of Mexican wineries has been
outstanding during the last few years, their production capacity
is still in the development stage. Indeed, some wineries have
applied unconventional business strategies to maintain their
market competitiveness. Vinisterra and Viña de Liceaga, for
example, have implemented “Ruta del Vino,” a highway and
paved road system that leads tourists to vineyards and wineries
in the wine region of Baja California during the harvest season
(Quiñónez-Ramírez et al., 2011).
 RESULTS
The next step in the fsQCA investigation is to calibrate the
causal and outcome conditions. In the case of the wine industry

cluster of Baja California, the causal conditions correspond to
the internal and external explanatory conditions previously
discussed in this paper. The outcome condition corresponds
to the HPL in this industry cluster. The calibration process was
made through the direct method, and thus the explanatory
conditions R&D, SHC, PPI, GSR, CS, GCR, and IINN were fixed
as full membership (6 points), crossover point (3 points), and full
non-membership (0 points) (Ragin, 2006, 2008). Table 4 shows
the anchor point for these conditions. In the case of PC, the
values were calibrated based on annual case production (Table
4). On the other hand, the calibration values of the HPL were
computed based on firm profits, mainly full membership (30
points), cross-over point (9 points), and full non-membership
(1 point) that correspond to the media of profits in the Mexican
wine industry.

this model. It reveals the configurations of the winery activities in this cluster. Consequently, the gaps in the consistency values are
useful for establishing a consistency threshold, and the values below 0.80 show substantial inconsistencies (Ragin, 2008). In this
case, the consistency threshold was set at 0.80 for a high-performance level in the truth table.

In the same way, Table 5 shows the configurations that lead to the three solutions: complex (zero logical remainders),
intermediate (logical remainders making sense in the final solution), and parsimonious solutions (all logical remainders without
any possibility of evaluation) (Ragin, 2000, 2006, 2008). However, in the wine industry cluster of Baja California, the intermediate
solution is superior to the other two solutions according to the interpretation of the results (Ragin, 2006, 2008). In this sense, the
analysis of the parsimonious and intermediate solutions contributes to determining the central and peripheral causal conditions
that shape this research on the explanation of the HPL (Fiss, 2011).

Table 6 shows the modified truth table with the results of
sufficiency and the combinations to achieve the desired outcome
(HPL). Combination 1 shows R&D, SHC, PPI, GSR, CS, GCR, and
PC that jointly explain an HPL in the wine industry cluster of Baja
California. The intermediate and parsimonious solutions are
included in the analysis of sufficiency.
Table 7 shows the intermediate solution with only one
combination satisfying the 0.80 threshold. A consistency
value of 0.99 and a coverage value of 0.81 were achieved in
the case of the intermediate solution, while a consistency
value of 0.75 and a coverage value of 1 were achieved in the

case of the parsimonious solution. Therefore, the intermediate
solution shows a single configuration that explains 81.26% of
the cases comprising the desired output with a consistency
value of 0.9926. These results suggest that only one possible
path leads to an HPL among firms in the wine industry cluster
of Baja California. Even if the interdependent innovations (IINN)
condition is not present in the intermediate solution, seven
conditions are considered necessary for achieving an HPL in this
industry cluster. It is essential to keep in mind that R&D, SHC,
PPI, GSR, CS, GCR, and PC must be jointly present to achieve
the desired outcome.

The parsimonious solution offers four combinations
favoring an HPL in the wine industry cluster of Baja California
(Table 7). The first configuration demonstrates the absence of
IINN with a coverage value of 0.83 and a consistency value of
0.78, suggesting that firms in this industry cluster do not need
to develop IINN to achieve an HPL. The second configuration,
R&D with a coverage of 0.93 and a consistency of 0.82, implies
that firms need to develop R&D efforts to obtain an HPL. The
third configuration, GSR, with a coverage value of 0.98 and a
consistency value of 0.83, suggests the importance of this
condition to achieve an HPL. Finally, the fourth configuration, PC,
with a coverage of 0.97 and a consistency of 0.90, demonstrates
the importance of this condition to obtaining an HPL.
Table 8 shows the necessary conditions for achieving an
HPL in the wine industry cluster of Baja California. The threshold is
fixed at 0.80 for evaluating whether a condition is “almost always
necessary” (Ragin, 2000). The results show that seven variables
are necessary conditions (consistency values above 0.80).

Finally, alternative calibration values were used to test
for the validity and robustness of the results. Intermediate
solution results show a consistency solution of 0.8126 (above
the threshold of 0.80) and a coverage solution of 0.9926. The
parsimonious solution shows a consistency solution of 0.7505
and a coverage solution of 1.
DISCUSSION
The wine industry cluster of Baja California is moving towards
an HPL. An essential feature in this industry cluster is that small
and medium-sized firms are responsible for supplying necessary
inputs to important wineries. Even if large firms operate with
10

RAE | São Paulo | 61(2) | March-April 2021 |1-13 | e2019-0626

cutting-edge technologies, small and medium-sized wineries
have a sizable production capacity. In this sense, Vinos de
Liceaga, for example, is a small company that acquired Italian
technology, namely, copper and steel alembic for wine production.
Another example is Monte Xanic, a medium-size company that
invested in novel technology to improve its wine production
through innovative irrigation systems. Moreover, this company
is a pioneer at using micro-oxygenation and night harvesting to
increase the quality of its wines. Vinisterra is another example
of a small winery that follows a process in which the wine is well
known for its exceptional flavor.
 On the other hand, large, medium-sized, and small
firms in this wine industry cluster have specialized technical
employees who are continuously trained to produce highquality wine. GSR demonstrates how the supply chain in this
industry is highly integrated, improving the production capacity
of several firms in this cluster. Similarly, government support
has been essential to improve the quality of wine production
in this industry cluster. The Act for the Promotion of the Wine
Industry of 2018, for example, has enabled the development
of joint ventures between companies and government
agencies in charge of stimulating wine production capacity
through the adoption of efficient technologies. However, it is
expected that the interaction between wine companies and
specialized government agencies, as well as other national
and international organizations, will allow the adoption of
adequate strategies to promote Mexican wine in national and
international markets.
Finally, complementarity between large and medium-sized/
small companies is an essential issue to obtain an HPL in the
wine industry cluster of Baja California. A significant percentage
of the production capacity of large companies, for instance,
depends on agreements established with medium-sized/small
producers that could generate synergies and the development
of competitive advantage. Mostly, these synergies are drawn
from sharing knowledge embodied in specialized human capital.
CONCLUSIONS
This research shows evidence of sufficiency that leads firms to
acquire an HPL in the wine industry cluster of Baja California. The
sufficiency configuration was demonstrated by the joint presence
of R&D, SHC, PPI, GSR, CS, and GCR. However, this finding also
contributes to supporting the possibility of designing a successful
strategy to enable these companies in the wine industry cluster
of Baja California to become more competitive.

Additionally, the evaluation of the parsimonious and
intermediate solutions contributes to gaining insight into how the
central and peripheral causal conditions contribute to generating
an HPL. In this sense, PC, GSR, and R&D are necessary conditions
for achieving an HPL among wineries in the wine industry cluster
of Baja California. The absence of IINN in this configuration
suggests that firms in the wine industry cluster of Baja California
can develop alternative mechanisms to innovate. This finding
reinforces the idea that R&D is a core condition to achieve an
HPL in this industry cluster. Finally, results also suggest that R&D,
GSR, and PC are necessary conditions to successfully innovate
in the wine industry cluster of Baja California.

Article: The sample laminate prepared above was set on flexible die bonder “DB-730” (made by Renesas Eastern Japan Semiconductor, Inc., trade name) and the dicing tape was expanded by the expanding device. The rate of expansion was 10 mm/s and the amount of expansion was 4 mm. Then, the semiconductor chips in the expanded sample laminate were picked up using the multi-pin push-up jig of flexible bonder “DB-730” (made by Renesas Eastern Japan Semiconductor, Inc.) in which 9 ejector needles (made by Micro-Mechanics Pte Ltd., SEN-83-05, needle diameter: 0.7 mm, tip: semicircular, 350 μm in diameter) are arranged in a grid pattern at an interval of 4.2 mm while pushing up the needles and using a rubber chip (made by Micro-Mechanics Pte Ltd., trade name: 13-087E-33, 10 mm×10 mm) as a pick-up collet. Here the semiconductor chips were picked up while pushing up the needles in two stages; they were pushed up under the conditions of a push-up height of 300 μm and a push-up rate of 89.4 mm/s in the first stage, and under the conditions of a push-up height of 1,500 μm and a push-up rate of 8.94 mm/s in the second stage for a holding time after pushing up (pick-up time) of 500 ms. Pick-up properties in this experiment were evaluated based on the following criteria.
[Pick-Up Properties]

A: The adhesive film for a semiconductor could be cut and the semiconductor chips with an adhesive film were successfully picked up.
B: The adhesive film for a semiconductor could not be completely cut, making it impossible to pick up the semiconductor chips and causing chip cracks.

As Table 1 shows, it has been proved that when using the adhesive films for a semiconductor of Examples 1 and 2 having a thickness in the range of 1 to 15 μm and a tensile elongation at break of less than 5%, and in which the tensile elongation at break is less than 110% of the elongation at the maximum load, the adhesive films for a semiconductor could be divided in the above-described pick-up step, making it possible to prepare semiconductor chips with an adhesive film. It has also been found that flash in the divided adhesive films was sufficiently reduced and the divided adhesive films had substantially the same shape as that of the semiconductor chip. On the other hand, when the adhesive films for a semiconductor of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 were used, the adhesive films for a semiconductor could not be divided in the above-described expansion step or pick-up step.
 The above results have proved that the method for producing a semiconductor chip with an adhesive film using an adhesive film for a semiconductor of the present invention is capable of producing a semiconductor chip with an adhesive film laminated thereon in which flash is sufficiently little and which has substantially the same shape as that of the semiconductor chip, and capable of achieving both assembling properties and reliability in a method of producing a semiconductor device based on a stealth dicing process.

THE GISBORNE BREAKWATER. Gisborne, April 18.—The breakwater is now advanced 700 feet in width, 18 feet of water at high tide. This afternoon, two hours after low water, the Union Company's Mail steamer, drawing over 9 feet, steamed alongside, and though a considerable swell was running in the bay, was moored without difficulty. She had a over 200 tons of cargo on board, which was discharged direct into trucks, thus saving considerable expense and delay. Captain Dawson said he would be able to come into port now at any time with fine weather, and in a few months, when a few hundred feet were added, in any weather. The pier is constructed so that there is no roll, as at other places. The s.s. Beautiful Star, from Oamaru, arrived at 10 p.m. on Wednesday. Mr J. Richardson, her chief officer, reports leaving Oamaru at 3 p.m. on that day had fresh N.E. winds, with S.B. swell and clear weather, down the coast. The brigantine Enterprise, with cargo from Napier, arrived yesterday morning and anchored off Carey Bay. She left Napier on the 2nd inst., experienced moderate southerly winds until off Timaru on the evening of the 12th, when a strong S.W. gale set in which held for 24 hours, when it moderated and was followed by light N.E. winds and calms to arrival. Captain Connor reports speaking the brigantine Frank Guy, from Kaipara for this port, about 30 miles south of Banks Peninsula on the 10th inst. The barque Loch Ness, with a cargo of iron bark timber from Newcastle, reached the heads early yesterday morning, after being blown past the port for four days by the late S.W. gale. She was tendered by the tug Koputai and brought into port, anchoring off Carey Bay at 11:30 a.m. in readiness for towing to Dunedin. Captain Petersen reports leaving Newcastle on the 4th inst., carried moderate northerly winds, with fine weather, until the 9th, when it increased to a gale, with high seas, for 12 hours. It then moderated, and was followed by west around to S.B. and baffling winds until she sighted the Solander on the morning of the 12th, when a heavy southerly gale set in, and the vessel was hove to for 18 hours, when it veered to the S.W., and she squared away for Foveaux Strait at 6 a.m. on the 13th, it still blowing a gale, with terrific seas; cleared the straits and passed Waipapapa Point at 8 p.m. on the same day, the wind and seas increasing. Captain Petersen, finding he could not steer the vessel, owing to the terrific seas, she was again hove to on the starboard tack until 4 a.m. on the 14th, when the gale slightly moderated and she squared away again for Cape Saunders light, but owing to the gale she was driven to the northward. The gale continued until the 16th, when it died away and was followed by light S.B. and N.B. winds, which brought her up to the heads, and was towed into port as above. The s.s. Orawaiti, with cargo from Westport direct, arrived at the Hattie Street wharf at 8 a.m. yesterday, and proceeded to land cargo. Mr Maundrell (her chief officer) reports leaving Westport at 11 a.m. on the 10th Inst. She had a strong gale from S.W. to W. until she passed the Brothers at 9:20 a.m. on the 16th inst.; thence she had light variable winds with a heavy S.B. swell to arrival at quarters as above. The s.s. Grafton landed her cargo and transhipments from the s.s. Manapouri at the Hattie Street wharf yesterday. The s.s. Beautiful Star landed cargo at the Rattray Street wharf yesterday. The s.s. Wakatipu commenced discharging her cargo of coal at the Jetty Street wharf yesterday. The s.s. Manapouri is to leave Port Chalmers on Saturday for Melbourne, via the Bluff and Hobart. The brigantine Camille, with a full cargo of timber from Hokianga, arrived off Otago Heads at midnight on Wednesday, and was towed up to Dunedin by the s.s. Plucky. Captain Helgeson reports leaving Hokianga on March 29, met strong southerly winds and cleared Cook Strait on April 3, passed Banks' Peninsula on the 10th inst., and thence had calms and southerly winds to arrival.

No leakage from nail holes, and perfect stiffness obtained, unaffected by the heaviest gales. Special provision for carrying off "sweat" or moisture, and also for ventilation. No building having iron roofing should now be erected without using the patent BATTEN. As there is a considerable saving by using less expensive Nails than those required by the old method, the cost of using the BATTEN does not exceed 2s to 3s per square of roofing, or on a moderate sized building about £2 to £3. The use of the Patent BATTEN has been approved by leading Architects and Engineers throughout the Colony. It may be obtained (price, 6s 9d per 100 lineal feet) at MESSRS FINDLAY & CO.'S, Cumberland street, DUNEDIN. J. AITKEN CONNELL, 42 Queen street, Auckland. Telephone No. 239. E.

SHACKLOCK, South End Foundry, Crawford street, Dunedin. DUNEDIN, 1888. Now In preparation, and will be issued about the end of April next, W. J. PICTOR'S; Splendid View of the CITY OF DUNEDIN. W. J. PICTOR begs to announce that he was fortunate enough to secure the services of the late MR G O'BRIEN, Artist and Draughtsman (who was admitted by all to have had unequalled facility in bringing first-class knowledge of draughtsmanship and architecture to bear on this class of work) to paint a picture of the City of Dunedin for reproduction as a COLOURED LITHOGRAPH. The painting was finished a short while prior to Mr O'Brien's death, and is pronounced by competent critics to be not only correct in detail—indeed, a view of the city as truthful as the reflection in a mirror—but to be a highly meritorious and artistic painting, the reproduction of which will be worthy of a place in every home. Accompanying the view there will be a Key Plan, indicating the principal buildings in the city and the notable points in the landscape. I have entrusted the lithographing of the picture to the Caxton Printing Company, whose success in coloured lithography is so well known. The view will be printed in 12 colors, so that proper brilliance and delicacy of outline may be assured. In the Otago Daily Times of the 9th October appeared the following notice of Mr. O'Brien's picture: "One of the very best of the many excellent views of Dunedin that have been painted is a large watercolor that was finished by the late Mr. George O'Brien only a few days before his death. It was executed, we believe, to the order of Mr. W. J. Prictor, for the especial purpose of being chromolithographed, and the artist has evidently taken unusual pains over his work. It is satisfactory and at the same time a little surprising to find that this necessary attention to detail has not been allowed in any way to fetter the artist. There is nothing at all cramped or artificial about the work which, while accurately portraying the city and its surroundings, has all the breadth and freedom of the ordinary landscape. Of the two vantage points from which the most comprehensive view of Dunedin can be obtained, W. J. Prictor chose the best. Any position to the north, near Logan's Point, commands the city well, but the distance is too great, while the hills to the southward, whence Mr. O'Brien took his sketch, give an equally complete view of the town and bring it much closer. The immediate foreground of this picture shows a grass-grown declivity, immediately beyond which is to be seen Fernhill Club, prettily girt with trees, the Southern Cemetery, etc. From this the whole city stretches away—a very distinct and striking panorama. Although none of the principal buildings are emphasized in the way that sometimes disfigures such pictures, they are all perfectly recognizable. St. Matthew's Church, the Iron and Woodware Factory, First Church, the Town Hall, Knox Church, and the University, etc., can all easily be picked out, while right away in the background glisten the white monuments of the Northern Cemetery, mere specks in the distance, but standing out plainly against a belt of purple bush. Beyond this again rise the Ravensbourne hills and Mount Cargill, all very accurately drawn—in fact, the drawing and perspective of the whole picture is almost faultless. It takes into the left all the higher parts of the city as far as the High School rectory, and to the right embraces a fine view of the harbour, the wharves, and the railway overbridge. The picture is well, although not too brightly, lighted, and Mr. O'Brien's whole scheme of colouring is very judicious. The contrasts are sufficiently distinct, but the tints are subdued and harmonise very pleasantly. A more promising subject for the chromo-lithographer could not be wished, and the Caxton Printing Company, who have been entrusted with this part of the work, will no doubt be able to turn out excellent work. Judging from some similar work they have now in hand, they have quite mastered the many difficulties of the process. When ready for issue, the chromo should command a ready sale, especially as it will represent the last work of an artist whose productions are well and favourably known in this city. The size of the picture is 34in x 24in, so that it will be just within the postal limit. The canvasser will call at every house in Dunedin and suburbs within the next few weeks, and orders will be supplied immediately the picture is ready for issue, about the end of April next. Price ... ... ... 2s 6d (Delivered in town and suburbs). Posted to any address... ... 35. The Picture will be issued handsomely framed in massive gilt or black and gold frames at 15s.

Article: [0152] As explained in detail above, the key switch device 1 according to the third embodiment is constructed such that the second cam portion 24B of the second link member 4 is supported by the cantilever member 32 extended like a cantilever beam from the second link member 4 and the cantilever member 32 is urged by the torsion spring 33 in the direction to bring the first cam portion 24A of the first link member 3 and the second cam portion 24B into contact with each other. By the contact state of the first cam portion 24A of the first link member 3 and the second cam portion 24B of the second link member 4 and the cooperative operation of the torsion spring 33 urging the cantilever member 32, the key top 2 can be urged upward to be held in the non-depressed position and also the key top 2 is allowed to return to the non-depressed position at the time of cancellation of the depression. Accordingly, the key switch device 1 can be constructed without use of a rubber spring and a complicated urging mechanism, which can achieve a cost reduction. Moreover, the torsion spring 33 urges the cantilever member 32 and therefore the first cam portion 24A and the second cam portion 24B are continuously in contact with each other with the contact position varying in response to the vertical movement of the key top 2. By changing the shapes of the first cam portion 24A and the second cam portion 24B as needed, therefore, it is possible to freely design the click touch which occurs during the key operation.
 [0153] Furthermore, the placing part 34 for placing the torsion spring 33 is provided in the second link member 4, so that the torsion spring 33 can integrally be mounted in the second link member 4, thus achieving a size reduction of the whole key switch device 1.
[0154] The torsion spring 33 having the first arm 33A and the second arm 33B is used as the urging member for bringing the first cam portion 24A and the second cam portion 24B into contact with each other and the first arm 33A is held by the wall portion 35 of the first holding part 36 in the spring placing section 34 while the second arm 33B is held by the fixing pieces 37 of the second holding part 38. Thus, the first arm 33A and the second arm 33B which provide the urging force to each other in the torsion spring 33 are held. This simple structure makes it possible to efficiently transmit the urging force produced between the arm portions 33A and 33B to the cantilever member 32.
 [0155] Moreover, the first arm 33A is movably held in the U-shaped groove of the wall portion 35 of the first holding part 36 and the second arm 33B is fixedly held by each fixing piece 37 of the second holding part 38, so that the urging force generated by the torsion spring 33 is transmitted from the first arm 33A being in contact with the cantilever member 32 to the cantilever member 32. At this time, the first arm 33A being movably held in the U-shaped groove of the wall portion 35 of the first holding part 36, during the depressing operation of the key top 2, the first arm 33A is allowed to flexibly move in the first holding part 36 in response to the reactive force resulting from the contact force occurring between the first cam portion 24A and the second cam portion 24B, while constantly holding the first cam portion 24A and the second cam portion 24B in a contact relation.
 [0156] In addition, there are provided the restricting projection 30 formed extending from the side surface of each plate member 18 of the first link member 3 and the second link member 4 and the wall member 31 having the shaft-restricting curved surface 31A integrally formed with the engagement member 10 near the inner side end of each engagement groove 10A, so that the horizontal movement of the key top can be restrained based on the cooperative operation between the restricting projection 30 and the shaft-restricting surface 31A of the wall member 31. There is no need to provide a guide wall, a positioning member, and the like of a relatively larger height to restrain the horizontal movement of the key top 2 in the course of depression. Consequently, a cost reduction can be achieved by the simple structure.
 [0157] The second cam portion 24B is formed with the cam surface 25A and the first cam portion 24A is formed with the cam surface 25A which comes into contact at an acute angle in plan view with the cam surface 25A of the second cam portion 24B at the linear and point-shaped contact portions and has the slanted surface 60. Between the second cam portion 24B and the slanted surface 60, the clearance 63 is provided to be open from the contact portions toward the fixed point 64 side of the torsion spring 33. Accordingly, if the cam surface 25A of the first cam portion 24A formed in an acutely-angled shape wears when the depressing operation of the key top 2 is repeatedly performed, the cam surface 25A will wear with the clearance 63 gradually closing from the contact portions to the fixed point 64 side of the torsion spring 33. As a consequence, the point of action S of the urging force of the torsion spring 33, as shown in FIG. 13, comes close to the fixed point 64 side of the torsion spring 33, so that the urging force of the torsion spring which is exerted on the cantilever member increases. Thus, even when the initial urging force of the torsion spring 33 is reduced due to the wear of the cam surface 25A of the first cam portion 24A, the reduction in initial urging force is cancelled out by an increment of the increased urging force when the point of action S of the urging force in the contact portions of the cam surfaces 25A of the first cam portion 24A and the second cam portion 24B comes close to the fixed point 64 side of the torsion spring. Consequently, even if the switching operation is repeatedly performed for a long term, the depression characteristic of the key top 2 can be surely prevented from being largely changed and can be stabilized. The switching operation can be ensured stably over a long term.
 [0158] In the case where the elastic force of the cantilever member 32 is reduced due to the repeated depressing operation of the key top 2, as mentioned above, the point of action S of the torsion spring 33 in the contact portions of the first cam portion 24A and the second cam portion 24B comes close to the fixed point 64 side of the torsion spring 33, which increases the urging force of the torsion spring 33 which is exerted on the cantilever member 32. Accordingly, the increased urging force can compensate the reduction in elastic force of the cantilever member 32. This also make it possible to stabilize the depression characteristic of the key top 2.
[0159] It is to be noted that the present invention is not limited to the first through third embodiments and may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the essential characteristics thereof. For instance, in the first and second embodiments, the present invention is applied to a notebook-size personal computer. It needs scarcely be said that the present invention may be applied to an electronic device provided with a key switch device such as a typewriter, a word processor, etc.
[0160] In each preferred embodiment, for the restriction of the horizontal movement of the key top 2 in the course of depression, the movement restricting mechanism is provided between the engagement member 10 and each link member 3, 4; however, the movement restricting mechanism may be provided between the key top 2 and each link member 3, 4.
 [0161] Additionally, in each preferred embodiment, the movement restricting mechanism of the present invention is realized in the key switch device 1 in which the upper shafts of the first link member 3 and the second link member 4 are rotatably engaged on the underside of the key top 2 and the lower shafts 22 are movably engaged in the engagement grooves 10A of the engagement members 10. It may naturally be realized in a key switch device having the reverse engagement relations to those engagement relations.
[0162] The present invention can similarly be realized about a guide member 5 in which a first link member 3 and a second link member 4 are pivotally supported in an X-shape.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This is a “national stage” application of International Patent Application PCT/EP2012/066121 filed on Aug. 17, 2012, which, in turn, is based upon and claims priority to German Patent Application 10 2011 081 062.5 filed on Aug. 17, 2011.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of Invention

The invention relates generally to a headlight for a motor vehicle and, more specifically, to a headlight for a motor vehicle having an interchangeable complex light source.
 2. Description of Related Art

The present invention relates to a headlight for a motor vehicle with a housing, at least one semiconductor light source generating light for a main function of the headlight, a cooling body touching the semiconductor light source in thermal coupling, an optical system collecting and directing light of the semiconductor source, a securing frame mechanically connected to the housing which holds the semiconductor light source with the cooling body and the optical system in the housing, and having an interface between a first part forming a complex light source and includes at least the semiconductor light source and the cooling body, and a second part, including at least the holder, wherein the first part is connected to the second part at the interface so that it can be separated without destruction. Such a headlight is known from published U.S. Pat. No. 7,712,948.
In the art of illuminating devices for motor vehicles a distinction is made between “lights” and “headlights.” Lights serve the purpose of signaling the presence and/or behavior of a motor vehicle and/or the intentions of its driver to other traffic participants. For example, brake lights, flashing lights, and navigation lights (without this being an exhaustive list).
Headlights serve the purpose of actively lighting the roadway in front of a motor vehicle such that the driver can quickly recognize obstacles in the roadway. The light distributions generated by headlights needs to be compliant with government regulations (for example, to prevent the blinding of other traffic participants). Examples of light distributions generated by headlights include passing light and high beam light distributions (without this being an exhaustive list).
 The task or capacity of a component to generate light distributions, be it light distributions or headlight distributions, is also referred to in the art as a light function. With respect to an illuminating device acting mainly as a headlight, headlight functions are also referred to as the “main function: so as to distinguish from other light functions provided by the same illuminating device (for example, when an illuminating device also performs signal light functions).
As known in the art of mass-produced road vehicles, semiconductor light sources have only been used for main headlight functions since around the year 2008, and were introduced earlier for signal light functions. One reason for the delay was the need for higher electric power for main functions in comparison to signal functions.
 Because of the relatively lower light fluxes produced by semiconductor light sources used in the automotive industry, several semiconductor light sources are typically combined into complex light sources for main headlight functions, so as to obtain the desired overall high light fluxes. Because of the long service life of light emitting semiconductors, little emphasis has been placed on repair options for headlights with semiconductor light sources until recently. Further, at the beginning of the development of high-performance semiconductor light sources, little data was available about the service life and the probability of failure of the light sources. Initially, it was assumed that the service life of the semiconductor light sources would be more than sufficient for the service life of a motor vehicle. However, there is now great deal more experience available about the durability and the probability of failure of semiconductor light sources used for main headlight functions. There is a desire in the art for interchangeable semiconductor light sources. Particularly in the case of motor vehicles from the mid-range or lower-range price segment, high repair costs for used motor vehicles are undesirable, even where there is a high probability that few motor vehicles are affected by light source failures. Without interchangeable semiconductor light sources, the entire headlight assembly would have to be replaced, which could require a disproportionately high cost compared to the value of the vehicle.
 However, difficulties arise in the case of such a replacement. Unlike halogen lamps, semiconductor light sources (such as LEDs) have a thermal interface in addition to the usual electrical and mechanical interfaces (for a power supply and positioning the light source). The thermal interface conducts away the heat generated in the operation of the semiconductor light source. Typically, the LED is firmly thermally coupled to a cooling body with thermal adhesives or heat sink paste. Thus, unlike the mechanical and electrical interfaces, it is difficult to provide the LED with a separable connection.
Further, in the event of a change of the light source there is the danger of the optical system going out of adjustment and causing the oncoming traffic to be blinded. Moreover, light modules for main headlight functions typically require a horizontal and a vertical default setting. Because of this, mounting light modules is expensive and typically prevents disassembly and replacement of the light modules for repair purposes. For this reason, light modules known in the art involve fixed units, where the light module can not be changed without destroying the unit after installation of the headlight during production.
To change LED light sources in the headlight in spite of these obstacles, Published U.S. Pat. No. 7,712,948 provides a light source module that has at least one light emitting element (in particular, LEDs), fiber optics, and collimating elements or lens elements. In addition, a retainer for such a system is provided, in particular in the form of a motor vehicle headlight. The headlight also has an optical system. The light source module is equipped to be positioned on a reference plane of the optical system, wherein it is also equipped to be replaced in a simple way, in particular without requiring soldered or welded connections.
 The light source module known in the art has light exit surfaces arranged in series. A longitudinal edge of this arrangement is considered an optical element and should be reproduced by a further optical element (referred to as secondary as a light/dark border of a light distribution of the headlight. To this end, an exact and stable positioning of the longitudinal edge is necessary with respect to the further optical element. First, second, and third reference points are provided for this exact positioning between optical faces of the module and the optical system of the headlight. For example, the reference points should be made of hard rubber, plastic or metal. Position correction should be made possible by altering the thickness of the reference points. A change in the position of the LEDs with their cooling body relative to the remaining light module is also mentioned as an alternate setting option.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention differs from the prior art with a first part forming the complex light source having at least one optical system collecting and directing a light of the semiconductor light source in addition to the semiconductor light source and the cooling body. In this way, the interface lying between the light exit surfaces of the semiconductor light source known in the art is shifted between the first interchangeable first part and the second part remaining in the headlight. Thus, the shifted interface no longer lies between the light exit surfaces of the semiconductor light sources and the optical system.
 Between the light exit surfaces of the semiconductor sources and the entry into the subsequent optical system in the roadway, occurring inaccuracies in position have a strong effect on the quality of the resulting light distribution. This holds true in particular for projection systems whose primary optical systems are used with short focal distance and narrow tolerances in order to produce an intermediate image of the light entry surface of the semiconductor light sources, which is then projected by a subsequent projection lens in the roadway as light distribution into the front region of the headlight.
Due to the inventive shifting of the interface, an advantage is achieved in that no inaccuracies in position occur in the interface between the light exit surfaces of the semiconductor light source and the optical system when the light source is changed. The interface is a part of the pre-installed complex light source as a whole. Thus, inaccuracies in position occurring in the interface do not have as strong an effect on the quality of the light distribution created by the headlight.
Ultimately, using the present invention, a headlight equipped with semiconductor light sources for main functions is provided, in which the light source can be easily changed in case of repair. In particular, the headlight is not incorrectly adjusted when changing the light source. Neither the location of the light module in the headlight nor the optical system of the light module itself is changed in the replacement of the light source.
 In one embodiment, the headlight has a housing with a service opening which is open from the factory, or is equipped to be cut open in a predetermined service opening region in case of repair. In operation, the headlight housing has geometries for fastening a cover with which the service opening in the headlight can be closed again after replacement of the complex light source.
In one embodiment, the first part and the second part together form a light module which is a projection module. Further, the light module has a cover equipped for amplification of a brightness gradient at a light/dark border of the light distribution. In another embodiment, the cover is a minor cover equipped to direct incident light of the semiconductor light sources on a secondary optical system of the projection module.
In one embodiment, the optical system of the complex light source includes all optical components of the light module. Further, the light module is a projection module and the optical system of the complex light source includes a cover as well as a secondary optical system. In a further embodiment, the secondary optical system is a projection lens or a parabolic minor.
In another embodiment, the individual parts of the complex light source are detachably connected to one another. Further, the complex light source has an electronic component in which parameters of the electrical interface are stored, wherein the parameters can be read via a control device. Further still, the complex light source is equipped with a temperature sensor (in particular, an NTC or PTC resistor) with which the temperature of the light source can be determined.
 In one embodiment, the complex light source can be mechanically connected to the light module with detachable fastening elements (for example, screws, latches, bolt or bayonet locks) such that the complex light source can be separated from the light module and replaced without destruction. The latches, bolt, or bayonet locks have at least one spring that presses a bolt or another latching geometry into a counterpiece, in which a bolt element is held (either non-positively or positively). Further, the spring and the bolt element may be designed to be in one piece. The bolt element may be part of the complex light source. Further still, the bolt element may be part of the second part. In another embodiment, several spring elements are equipped to clamp the first part and the second part to one another without play.
Additional features and advantages arise from the dependent claims, the description and the attached figures.
The foregoing features and features still to be explained can be used not only in the respective specified combination, but rather also in other combinations or by themselves without departing from the scope of the present invention.

In one embodiment, the connection occurs via hinges 22, 24, 26 with bearings on the securing frame side, such that the light module 12 can be swiveled in the headlight 10 around a horizontal axis 28 and a vertical axis 30.
 The housing has a transparent cover disk 32, which covers a light exit opening of the housing 14. In addition, the housing 14 has a service opening 34 or a service opening region. From its size and location, the service opening 34 is equipped to allow insertion and removal of the first part of a light module 12. Through the service opening 34, which may be arranged in a housing rear wall opposite the transparent cover disk, the complex light source 16 can be replaced as the first part 16 of the light module 12, while the second part 18 of the light module 12 remains with the securing frame 20 in the headlight 10.
This service opening 34 for replacement of the light source can be open from the factory, or can be cut into the headlight housing 14 in the case of repair. In the latter case, the housing 14 has the service opening region in place of the service opening 34. In any case the headlight housing 14 has geometries for the fastening of a cover 38, with which the service opening 34 can be locked in the headlight 10 after replacement of the light source. Possible fastening elements include screw bosses, hooks, and/or a stop collar, with or to which a screw cap can be fastened as a cover 38. In such a case, the screw cap is additionally mounted on the headlight housing 14 after the repair.
 FIG. 2 shows the light module 12 from FIG. 1 with a first part 16 detached from the second part 18 of the light module 12, but not completely withdrawn from the first part (the complex light source 16). With the help of positioning or reference geometries and bolt elements complementary to one another on the securing frame 20 and the complex light source 16, the first part 16 can be detachably and precisely fastened on the second part 18 of the light module 12. In operation, reference geometry is defined, for example, as mechanical stops and guides and rigid snap-in elements. By way of example, a spring-loaded movable snap-in element could be the bolt element.
 In one embodiment, the second part 16 of the light module has at least two first bearing structures. In each case, a first bearing structure and a second bearing structure forms a pair. The first and second bearing structures are designed such that the bearing structures of a pair engage. Thus, it is possible for the second part to be mounted (or, removed) when it is being connected (or, removed). The first bearing structures are arranged along a straight line which forms a pivot axis 29. This makes it possible for the mounted part to be pivoted around the pivot axis 29. The pivot axis 29 may be parallel to the pivot axis 28. In one embodiment, the first bearing structures are formed by a ribbed profile of the second part perpendicular to the optical axis of the light module. The second part of the light module has open recesses on one side. As an example of a recess open on one side, reference is made to a U shape. In the case of mounting (or, removing), the second part in (or, from) the first part, the opening permits a mounting (or, removal) of the section of the ribbed profile into (or, from) the recess.
The bearing structures may be arranged such that, in the case of an orientation in space, (as arises in the event of a proper use of the headlight in a vehicle on a level road), the mounted second part remains in the mounted state due to gravity and does not fall out. This simplifies the installation because it is not necessary to hold it in place. The second part is mounted in a first step and in a second step it, is locked by a swivel movement. Both procedures can be executed easily.
 In one embodiment, the first part additionally has ribbed profiles running parallel to the optical axis of the light module, and the second part has complementary recesses open on one side, which encompass the first ribbed profiles in mounted state with as little play as possible. The pairs of recesses and ribbed profiles permit a swivel movement around the axis 29 and hold in place the position of the second part to the first part in the direction of the pivot axis. Further, the ribbed profiles running parallel to the optical axis and the ribbed profiles that are perpendicular to the optical axis may merge into one another such that T profiles arise, which in addition to their bearing and guide functions, also have structure that reinforces the mechanical strength of the light module. In one embodiment, one swivel bearing structure is present and one guide is present parallel to the optical axis. These embodiments provide a headlight which has bearing structures that permit mounting of the first part into the second part and pivoting of the mounted part taking place around a pivot axis 29 to a locking position.
 Overall, the positioning or referencing geometries and complementary bolt elements on the securing frame 20 are equipped to cooperate in the locked position such that the second part is held precisely, firmly and without play. To detach the complex light source 16 forming a first part 16 of the light module 12 from the light module 12, the complex light source 16 is first detached by pressing the spring-loaded bolt element 42. FIG. 2 shows a movable end 44 of the bolt element 42 in two positions, to illustrate the movement options of the movable end 44. Subsequently, the complex light source 16 can be swiveled out from the reference geometry of the securing frame 20, lifted from the second part 18, and removed from the headlight housing through the service opening. In this way, the complex light source 16 is easy to replace and can be replaced like a conventional halogen or xenon lamp in the event of damage. At the same time, the second part 18 of the light module 12 remains stationary in the headlight.
 FIG. 3 shows one embodiment of a complex light source 16 forming the first part of the light module from FIG. 2 in a completely lifted state from the second part of the light module. FIG. 4 shows an exploded view of the complex light source of FIG. 3. The complex light source includes at least one semiconductor light source, the cooling body, and at least one optical system 50 collecting and directing light of the semiconductor light source(s) 46. In one embodiment, a total of 10 (n=10) semiconductor light sources 46 in the form of LEDs (light emitting diodes) or laser diodes are arranged on a circuit board 52 (or, a bus bar) with the semiconductor light sources controlling the LEDs and supplying them with electrical power. A plug 54 is used to establish a detachable plug connection to the electrical outlet of the circuit board (or, bus bar) to an electrical power supply on-board the motor vehicle. The number n can deviate from 10 and may particularly fall between 3 and 100.
 The circuit board 52 is firmly connected to the cooling body 48 in the joined state of the complex light source 16 and makes good thermal contact, in particular a heat conducting contact. The connection takes place in one embodiment with the help of a heat conducting adhesive or a heat sink paste. The cooling body 48 may consist of a good heat conducting metal such as aluminum or copper. The cooling body 48 may also have structures that enlarge its surface, such as cooling ribs or cooling pins. In one embodiment, a single piece and continuous cooling body 48 is used for all of the semiconductor light sources 46. The heat produced by the individual semiconductor light sources 46 is then distributed uniformly in the entire cooling body volume. This effectively prevents local overheating.
In addition, the complex light source 46 forming a first part of the light module 12 has an optical system 50 collecting and directing light of the semiconductor light source(s). In one embodiment, this optical system 50 collecting and directing light includes a single-piece, transparent, and solid body in which auxiliary optical systems are formed for a complex light source 16 having n semiconductor light sources. The auxiliary optical systems direct the light in a predetermined way. In one embodiment, the auxiliary optical systems are near field lenses with short focal distance whose focal points lie in a Petzval surface of a subsequent projection lens in the light path.
 In the case of a projection system, the auxiliary optical systems 56 form the light of the semiconductor light sources 46 (for example, such that within the light module 12 a light distribution in the form of an original image of the light distribution to be produced by the light module develops 12 in the front region of the headlight 10). This original image is projected by a subsequent projection lens in the light path in the front region of the headlight 10. In this case, the auxiliary optical systems 56 have short focal distances, making necessary a precise positioning of the auxiliary optical systems 56 with respect to the semiconductor light sources 46.
In one embodiment, the transparent solid body of the optical system 50 is fastened to the cooling body 48 with screws, wherein the circuit board 52 is fixed between the transparent solid body and the cooling body 48. Due to the necessity of a good thermal bond (which, for example, is imparted by a heat sink paste), the interface between the semiconductor light sources 46 and the cooling body 48 is difficult to detach and, therefore, is not suitable as an interface for a light source replacement.
Because of the small focal distances and the narrow tolerances of position at the interface between the semiconductor light sources 46 and their auxiliary optical systems 56, it is likely that in small inaccuracies in position will cause great adverse effects to the quality of the light distribution ultimately to be produced.
 One advantage of the present invention is that the interface between the first part 16 of the light module 12 and the second part 18 of the light module 12 does not exactly lie between the semiconductor light sources 46 and the cooling body 48. Further, the interface does not lie between the semiconductor light sources 46 and an optical system 50 collecting and directing light of the semiconductor light source. Because these two critical interfaces are part of the complex light source, the connections corresponding to these critical interfaces do not have to be separated in the event of a replacement of the light source.
As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the complex light source 16 has a bolt element. The bolt element 42 has a fixed end 60 that is fastened with a screw 62 to the cooling body 48, and a movable end 44 that is guided elastically/flexibly into a guide 64 of the cooling body 48. The guide 64 has a recess 66 that is open to the circuit board 52, wherein the recess is set up both to guide movement of the movable end 44 of the bolt element 42 and to limit it by a stop 67. A spring 68 is arranged between the cooling body 48 and the bolt element 42, wherein the arrangement takes place such that the spring 68 presses the movable end 44 of the bolt element 42 against the stop 67.
 In one embodiment, the individual parts of the complex light source 16 are detachably connected to one another, so that in the case of service individual parts of the complex light source 16 (in disassembled state of the complex light source 16) can be replaced. In another embodiment, the complex light source 16 also has an electronic component in which parameters of the electrical interface are stored and can be read out via a control device. Such parameters are, for example, the values of the operating current to be observed depending on the production batch of the semiconductor light sources 46 and the operating voltage of the semiconductor light sources 46. In the simplest case, the electronic component is an electrical resistor. One parameter value is stored with each such coding resistor. As an alternative to coding resistors, in one embodiment, programmable electronic storage elements are utilized that can be read out via a data bus. In this way, it can be ensured that the semiconductor light sources 46 of the new complex light source 16 (which may require altered operating voltages and/or operating currents) can be operated with correctly adapted values. Another example of an additional component of the complex light source is an NTC (negative temperature coefficient) or PTC (positive temperature coefficient). These are types of resistors that are dependent on temperature, with which the temperature of the light source can be determined.
 In one embodiment, the complex light source 16 has electronic devices for controlling the semiconductor light sources for the operation of the semiconductor light sources on the on-board power supply of the motor vehicle. This device supplies the semiconductor light source(s) with a regulated operating current and/or a regulated operating voltage. For their part, the electronic devices may be controlled by a control device that is not a component of the complex light source and which communicates with the electronics of the complex light source via a vehicle bus and connector. In one embodiment, supply of the electronics of the complex light source with electrical power also takes place. The controller can be arranged within or outside of the headlight in the vehicle.
 FIGS. 1 through 4 show a headlight 10 for a motor vehicle with a housing 14, at least one semiconductor light source 46 producing light for a main function of the headlight 10, a cooling body 48 contacting the semiconductor light source 46 in thermal coupling, an optical system 50 collecting and directing light of the semiconductor light source(s) 46, a securing frame 20 mechanically connected to the housing 14 which holds the semiconductor light source(s) 46 with the cooling body 48 and the optical system 50 in the housing 14, an interface between a first part forming the a complex light source 16, which includes at least the semiconductor light source(s) 46 and the cooling body 48, and a second part 18, which includes at least the securing frame 20. In operation, the first part 16 is connected to the second part such that it can be separated without destruction, and the first part 16 forming the complex light source 16 has, in addition to the semiconductor light source(s) 46 and the cooling body 48, at least one optical system 50 collecting and directing light of the semiconductor source(s) 46.
 FIG. 5 shows a front view of the headlight 10 with the light module 12. Thus, the view is from a direction that is anti-parallel to a main direction of emission of the light module 12. FIG. 5 shows a first axis 28 and a second axis 30, around each of which the light module 12 can be swiveled. The first axis 28 is pivotably mounted in/to a first bearing or hinge 22 and in/to a second bearing or hinge 24. The second axis 30 is pivotably mounted in/to the second bearing or hinge 24 and a third bearing or hinge 26. In one embodiment, the second bearing 24 is a ball joint in which the first axis 28 and the second axis 30 intersect. In an installed state, the first axis is horizontal and thus aligned about parallel to the road surface. The pivotability around the first axis allows a default setting of the beam width and a setting for the vertical position of a horizontal light/dark border and/or an automatic beam width adjustment of the light module 12.
The second axis 30 is arranged at such an angle to the horizontal one that pivotability around the second axis 30 allows a default setting of the main direction of emission of the light module 12 in horizontal direction and/or a bending light function, in which the light module 12 is pivoted, such as in the event of traveling around corners, such that its light beam swivels to the left in the case of a left turn and swivels to the right in the case of a right turn. In the case of an installed headlight 10, the second axis 30 is therefore substantially vertically aligned.
 The securing frame 20 of the light module 12 which may be swiveled in operation, corresponds to the second part 18 of the light module 12, with the second part remaining stationary in the housing 14 in the event of a replacement of the complex light source 16 with respect to the headlight 10. Thus, replacement of the complex light source 16 is not associated with a change of the default setting of the light module 12 and does not require a separation of kinematics for beam width adjustment or bending light function.
FIG. 6 shows a lateral view of the (cut open) headlight 10 from FIG. 5 and, in connection with FIG. 5, shows the support of the first axis 28 and the second axis 30. The pivoting around the second (vertical) axis 30 takes place by having the first bearing 22 (concealed in FIG. 6) swiveled by an actuator around the second axis 30. The pivoting around the first (horizontal) axis 28 takes place by having the third bearing swiveled by an additional actuator around the first axis 28. Thus, the first bearing 22 and the third bearing 26 are movable in the housing 14, while the second bearing 24 forms a stationary hold point with respect to the housing 14. Thus, FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate how the hold points of the light module 12 in the housing 14 are designed in one embodiment, such that the light module 12 in the headlight 10 can be swiveled around a first horizontal axis 28, and a second vertical axis 30.
 FIG. 7 shows one embodiment of the light module 12 as a projection module, as known in the art, along a line of intersection VII-VII in FIG. 5. The projection module of FIG. 8 has semiconductor light sources 46, a primary optical system as the optical system 50, a minor cover 70, and a secondary optical system 72. The semiconductor light sources 46 are soldered to a circuit board 52. Together with the primary optical system, this circuit board 52 forms the complex light source 16, which is implemented here as an array of one near field lens for each semiconductor light source 46, the cooling body 48, and the lock. The light emitted by the semiconductor light sources of the complex light source, from which individual beams a, b, c, d, e are shown, is formed by the near field lenses of the primary optical system into a light distribution in a curved surface, which corresponds to the Petzval surface 74 of the projection lens, which forms the secondary optical system 72. The cover plane contacts approximately the Petzval surface of the projection lens. The Petzval surface is a curved surface in the object space of a projection lens, which is reproduced by the projection lens on a plane surface in the image space of the projection lens. In FIG. 7, the object space is on the left and, thus, is in the light path before the projection lens, while the image space is on the right and, thus, is in the light path after the projection lens.
 The minor cover 70 divides the beam path of the primary optical system into a reflected portion (beams d, e) and a portion propagating past without reflection on the cover (beams a, b, c). Both portions are limited by the minor edge in the cover plane such that a light distribution with a sharp light/dark border is produced. This light distribution is projected through the projection lens onto the street. In operation, the mirror cover also reflects the part of the light (beams d, e) that is first shadowed onto the secondary optical system 72, such that this part is also refracted in the light area of the resulting light distribution and thus is not lost.
In one embodiment, the optical system of the light module 12 includes the complex light source 16 with a primary optical system, which produces a light distribution in an intermediate image surface. A secondary optical system, whose Petzval surface 74 lies roughly in the intermediate image surface, projects the light distribution of the intermediate image onto the street. The secondary optical system includes a projection lens. However, in one embodiment, it may also have at least one paraboloid reflector.
 The cover 70 produces distributions of passing light which have a light/dark border (HDG). The cover is arranged with respect to the Petzval surface of the secondary optical system such that the cover shadows or reflects a part of the light of the semiconductor light sources collected and directed by the primary optical system, wherein the shadowed or reflected part of the light does not penetrate through the secondary optical system or, in another beam path, penetrates through the secondary optical system as would be the case without the cover. In this way, the illumination gradient in the HDG can be increased and the range of the headlight can be improved.
As discussed above, the complex light source 16 includes the cooling body 48, the circuit board 52, semiconductor sources 46, and an optical system 50 collecting and directing light of the semiconductor light source(s) 46. In one embodiment, this optical system is restricted to the primary optical system of a projection system. However, in one embodiment, the optical system 50 includes not only the primary optical system, but rather all optical components of the light module 12. In the case of a projection light module, this includes (along with the primary optical system array) at least a cover or a minor 70, as well as at least one secondary optical system 72 realized as a projection lens or as a parabolic mirror. Further, the second part 18 of the light module 12 remaining in the housing includes the securing frame 20 with mounting and default setting. In one embodiment, a mechanical adjustment option is also provided for the secondary optical system and the cover on the securing frame, wherein the mechanical adjustment option can be adjusted in the direction of the optical axis.
 FIG. 8 shows sectional views of the complex light source together with the interface to the second part of the light module in different stages of replacement of the complex light source. FIG. 8 shows one embodiment where the bolt element 42 is a part of the complex light source 16. However, the bolt element can also be part of the securing frame 20. FIG. 8 shows the bolt element 42 in different positions.
In FIG. 8 a, a snap-on hook 76 of the bolt element 42 engages a complementary snap-on edge 78 of the second part 18. In operation, the bolt element 42 is held by the spring 68 in a locked position. The complex light source is in a state where it is snapped into the second part 18 of the light module 12. In operation, the spring 69 is pre-stressed. The complex light source 16 is locked with the second part 18 of the light module. In the locked state, the spring-loaded bolt element 42 presses the complex light source downward onto reference stops of the second part 18 of the light module, and clamps the connection in vertical direction without play. Because the spring 68 has to be tensioned further to release the connection, the locked state represents an energetically stable position that can only be released by supplying energy from the outside.
 FIG. 8 b shows the spring-loaded bolt element in a downward pressed position for releasing the complex light source, in which the complex light source 16 can be swiveled and removed. In FIG. 8 b, the spring 68 is tensioned at its maximum. The snap-on hook 76 of the first part 16 of the module is no longer held behind the snap-on edge of the second part 18 of the light module. The complex light source 16 is unlocked. The first part 18 of the light module can be swiveled from its catch position. In operation, the swivel movement takes place around a rotary joint 80 formed by interlocking protrusions of the first part 16 and of the second part 18.
FIG. 8 c shows the complex light source 16 in a completely released state from the second part 18 of the light module. In this state, removal of the complex light source 16 from the housing 14 is possible. The spring 6 is slackened at its maximum.

A consultation was held this afternoon. Bulletin Dr's Delafleld Sands and Ilarker held a consultation In the case of KoscoeConkling between and 6 o'clook thU afternoon and it was decided to immediately cut through the temple boue, to ascer tain whether there is pua lodged on the brain. Dr. Sands is the opera ting urgeon. bulletin Tlie doctors have left Mr. Conkilng's bedside. Theiei- no material change: but greater hunea are entertained for his reeovprv. There will be a bulletin Issued at 6:16 p. in. with a report of the oir atlon. Dr. Fordlce Barker has been ap pointed to give news to the prew. There will probably be no noticeable change for several hours. At9:p. m. Dr. Fordice llnrker, on behalf or the attending plivsl elans, said that Mr. Conkllng was resting much easier, and that there was no immediate dauger of death. His temperature was 102 and his pulse 92. Mr. Conkllng moved so much that his pulse could ouly be approximately taken. Dr. Harker said that the operation had been in everj w-ay successful. Two holes about half an Inch" in diameter were made in the skull be hind the ear, and about an ounce ol matter was taken out. He soon ceenied to be greatly relieved. After the operation Mr. Conkllng arose and walked In an adjoining room and returned. lieldes the phyilclaus Mrs. Conkllng ami Iter married daughters were with the pa tient constantly, Mr. Conkllng im not lieen able to recognize biiv i-m but his wife durlug the day, and be will probably remain unconcioufe all night because of the ether which was administered. Drs. Barker and Hand left the sick chamber at -45 and will not re turn until a. m. to-morrow. The surgical operation performed on the distinguished patient ihle evening is a very dellcitc one. It cousistsiu the cutting out ami re moval of a part of the squamous por tion of the temiMirai bone, tlie in cision U'ing made upou tie promt neuce w inch may be felt behind the ear.

Otherwise the inflammation may extend to the tissue of tlie brain. Deafness ol lin ear operated on results. The saw or drill with which the circular piece of spongy lioue is ex cised is like a jagged edge on the end a piece of small steel tubing. It is fixed for the flrit few turns by a prong in the center. The whole In strument is called a trepine. When the region of the inuer ear baa la-en reached the circular disk of bone carefully extracted and the mem brane beneath the boue cut through, a drainage tube Is then to be insert ed through which the matter, form ing in the abscess, can rlow freely into tbs anticeptic absorbant cotton at the outer end of the tube. This affords the best chance of confining! me muammaiion to its narrowest limits. At 11:25 Mr. Conkllng was restlug quietly. HU temperature and pulses are the same as at the last re port. At midnight Mr. Conkllng was walking up aud down bis room in a hult delirious condition. He sent for Mr. Stokes aud when he arrived Mr. Conkllng said to him: "Ed., Its no use. I am gone, I have fought against this for tome time I can't stand it auy longer." Mr. Stokes In going out saw Dr. Bauds at the door. He asked the doctor if Mr. Conkllng had any chance. t Dr. Sands said: He may live forty eight hours, but T doubt It. At 12:15 Mr. C(-nklIug's condition was unchanged.

The upper magnet holds the long, zinc-covered steel rod; the second holds a short steel rod. The gun being tired, the shot cuts the wire in the nearest frame, or screen, as it is tech. nically called, and so breaks the circuit of the upper electro-magnet, allowing tho long rod to fall. When the shell reaches the sec ond screen, tho ono furthest from the gun, it breaks the circuit ot the second electro magnet, thus allowing tbe shot-rod to falL This, after falling a short distant, strikes the trigger of the spring knife.

Article: High Density Polyethylene Gate Valve

ABSTRACT

A gate or gate-type valve is used as a flow regulating device specifically for use in saturated gaseous, high particulate, high temperature, and low pressure environments such as in landfill gas wellfields and similar environments where particulate and water gathering can obstruct the operation of a typical gate valve. The valve has a T-shaped body with a fluid flow tube and a transverse plunger tube. A plunger threads into the plunger tube to define a fluid-tight seal between the plunger and the plunger tube and has a distal end that opens and closes the fluid flow tube as the plunger is rotated between open and closed positions.
FIELD OF INVENTION

This invention relates to apparatus and methods for regulating fluidflow, and more particularly to a self sealing gate valve especiallyadapted and designed for use in challenging environments.
BACKGROUND

Landfills are often prolific contributors of green house gases,particularly methane (CH4) which according to the EPA is a greenhousegas approximately 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide (C02),emissions. A common method of waste disposal and treatment, landfillsproduce these gases, among others, from the anaerobic digestion bymicrobes of organic matter. These gases, typically composed of mostlymethane and carbon dioxide, may be collected and methane in particularmay be utilized, with contemporary technology, to generate electricityby combustion, fuel industrial boilers, or be converted to pipelinequality High-BTU gas. In utilizing the methane from the landfill,greenhouse gas emissions are greatly reduced.
 Landfills frequently have gas extraction systems to capture landfillgases. Gases are typically drawn out of a landfill with a low pressurevacuum via a wellfield collection system. The wellfield typicallyconsists of multiple gas extraction wells that extend deep beneath thesurface of the landfill to pull methane from a location near the bottomof the landfill. Each extraction well extends up to the surface of thelandfill and there the extraction wells are manifolded together so thatvacuum can be pulled with one centralized blower or compressor.
It is critical to regulate the vacuum draw on the landfill wellfield andflow of gas through the system and it will be appreciated that wellfieldgas recovery and extraction systems employ numerous flow regulatingdevices, including a variety of valves. Regulating the vacuum or draw onthe field regulates, to a degree, the type and rate of decomposition.Too much draw may pull oxygen into the wellfield enabling aerobicdecomposition and causing underground fires thus requiring shutdown ofthe wellfield resulting in unrestricted release of greenhouse gases intothe atmosphere. Too small of a draw will increase gas diffusion intosurrounding soil and eventual release of methane into the atmosphere.Typically each extraction well utilizes a valve at the head of the wellto adjust the vacuum pulled on the well. After monitoring the extractionwell's gas flow and composition, an operator may adjust this valve tooptimize gas recovery or limit oxygen pull into the landfill.
 Landfill gas monitoring and recovery is referred to as a wet gasindustry because the gases created in landfills are typically 100percent saturated because water is produced throughout the wellfield inaddition to oxygen, nitrogen, methane and carbon dioxide. The wet gas,the possibility of particulates, and low pressures associated with thesesystems present some significant challenges for gas flow regulatingdevices, particularly the valves used in the systems. Many existingvalves can be damaged by the corrosive environment, and particulates inthe gas often cause problems with proper sealing at the valve seat.
There is a need therefore for improved apparatus for regulating gas flowthrough landfill gas wellfield recovery systems, and in particular,valves that avoid the problems of know systems.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION

The subject invention is a gate or gate-type valve designed for use as aflow regulating device specifically for use in saturated gaseous, highparticulate, high temperature, and low pressure environments such as inlandfill gas wellfields and similar environments where particulate andwater gathering can obstruct the operation of a typical gate valve.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS

The valve assembly 10 according to the present invention is a gate valvethat is defined by a valve body or housing 12 and a plunger assembly 50.The plunger assembly 50 is in turn comprised of a plunger body 52 and avalve handle assembly 62. The body 12 is defined generally by a T-shapedfitting having a linear length of tubing 14 that is plumbed inline in awellfield gas line and a plunger assembly tube 16 that extendstransverse to the linear tubing 14. The housing 12 is preferably aone-piece unit that is fabricated from high density polyethylene (HDPE).The housing defines open conduits through the interior of the housing:the housing is plumbed in-line with appropriate connector fittings andthe gas flow path extends through the linear tubing 14 and the plungerassembly fits into the plunger assembly tube 16. As detailed below, theinterior of the housing includes plunger seating structures tofacilitate complete closure of the valve. It will be appreciated thatthe valve assembly 10 may be fabricated in any size appropriate for anyparticular installation—the nominal size of the tubing used for valveassembly 10 is sized to fit the tubing into which the valve assemblywill be installed.
 The outermost end 18 of plunger assembly tube 16 has external threads 20and internal threads 22, the purpose of which is detailed below.
With reference to FIG. 3, plunger assembly 50 comprises a plunger body52 and a valve handle assembly 62. Plunger body 52 is preferably definedby a one-piece elongate member that includes generally a distal end 54and a proximal end 56. An upper shaft portion 58 is adjacent theproximal end 56 and a lower shaft portion 60 that has an enlargeddiameter relative to the upper shaft portion 58 is at the distal end 54.Valve handle assembly 62 is the components shown in FIG. 3 that aredirectly and removably attached to the end of upper shaft portion 58 atdistal end 54 and allows an operator to axially rotate the plungerassembly 50 to open and close the valve assembly 10. Valve handleassembly 62 comprises the following components: an internally threadedbonnet 64, a first O-ring 80, a second O-ring 82, a cap 84, a spring pin86, and a handle 86. The bonnet 64 has a central opening 66, and as seenin FIG. 3, the bonnet 64 is assembled with the plunger body 52 withupper shaft portion 58 extending through opening 66 of bonnet 64. Theopening 66 is sized to conform closely to upper shaft portion 58 and toform a seal against it and that seal is enhanced by second O-ring 82,which resides in a circumferential groove in opening 66 so that theO-ring encircles upper shaft 58 and defines a seal between the bonnet 64and the upper shaft 58. The internal threads of bonnet 64 are identifiedwith reference number 68.
 With reference now to FIGS. 4 and 5 the assembled handle assembly 62will be detailed. The first O-ring 80 is installed in a circumferentialseat 90 in bonnet 64 and the second O-ring 82 is installed in acircumferential groove 92 in bonnet opening 66. With the first andsecond O-rings thus installed, the shaft 58 is inserted through opening66. Cap 84, which has an internal cylindrical blind opening 94 isinstalled over the end of shaft 58 and spring pin 86 is inserted throughan opening 96 in cap 84 and into an aligned opening 98 in shaft 58 tothereby secure the cap to the shaft. The “upper” end of cap 84 has asquare protrusion 100 that is sized to fit into a cooperatively shapedopening 102 in handle 88 and the handle is thus attached to the cap byinserting the protrusion 100 into the opening 102. The handle is securedto the assembly with a screw 104 that threads into a threaded opening105 in cap 84; a washer 106 is used to retain the handle on the cap.
The lower shaft portion 60 of plunger body 52 defines a sealing portionidentified generally with reference number 70 and a threaded portion 72.The sealing portion 70 includes at the distal end 114 of the plungerbody a semi-hemispherically shaped bottom portion. That is, moving fromthe proximal to the distal ends, the vertical sidewalls of the sealingportion 70 transition to a smoothly radiused circumferential area thattransitions to a generally flattened distal end 114.
 Valve 10 is assembled by attaching plunger assembly 50 with housing 12.Specifically, and as best illustrated in the cross sectional images ofFIGS. 4 and 5, distal end 54 of plunger body 52 is inserted into theopening of plunger assembly tube 16 and threaded portion 72 of theplunger body 52 is threaded into internal threads 22 of the plungerassembly tube 16. As the plunger body is threaded into the plungerassembly tube, the sealing portion 70 of lower shaft portion 60 movesinwardly into the body 12. Because the body is one-piece, the sealingportion 70 rotates as the body 52 is rotated to thread the body into thetube. At the point where the treaded portion 72 of the plunger body 52are fully threaded into the internal threads 22 the bonnet 64 may bethreaded onto the plunger assembly tube—that is, the internal threads 68of the bonnet 64 may be threaded onto the external threads 20 of theassembly tube 16 and the bonnet is tightened in place to secure theplunger body 52 to the housing 12. As the bonnet 64 is tightened ontothe external threads 20 of the assembly tube 16, first O-ring 80 iscompressed between the upper circumferential rim 106 that is defined bythe outer end 18 of assembly tube 16 and the seat 90 in the bonnet,thereby creating a leak-free seal between the interior of the valve 10and the exterior of the valve. Moreover, it will be appreciated that thebonnet prevents disassembly of the plunger body 52 from the housing 12.That is, with the bonnet installed and tightened as in FIG. 4, theplunger may not be threaded outwardly far enough to separate the plungerfrom the housing.
 The valve 10 is shown in the open position in FIGS. 4 and 6, and in theclosed position is FIGS. 5 and 7. From these figures it may be seen thatthe interior portion of the linear run of tubing 14 of housing 12defines a valve seat 24 that is configured complimentary to the shape ofsealing portion 70 of plunger body 52. That is, the valve seat 24 issemi-hemispherically shaped to correspond to the semi-hemisphericalshape of the distal end 114 of sealing portion 70. More specifically, asshown in the drawings, the distal end 114 is defined by thesubstantially vertical sidewall of the sealing portion 70, whichtransition to a radiused circumferential edge and a generally flattenedbottom portion at distal end 114.
It will be appreciated that as handle 88 is rotated axially to moveplunger body 52 inwardly into housing 12 (with the threaded portion 72of body 52 rotating in threads 22 of plunger assembly tube 16), thesealing portion 70 is driven into valve seat 24. When the distal end 114makes contact with the valve seat 24 and is tightened against the valveseat by continued rotation of handle 88, the valve 10 is in the closedposition, which of course closes the gas pathway through the valve. Itwill be appreciated that the valve assembly 10 is opened by axiallyrotating handle 88 in the opposite direction to move distal end 114 outof its sealing position against valve seat 24.
 With reference to FIGS. 6, 7 and 8, it may be seen that the valve seat24 is defined essentially by a cylindrical bore that is cut into valvehousing 12, wherein the axis of the bore is coaxial with the axisextending through plunger assembly tube 16 and the bore extends into thetubing 14 immediately below the tube 16 to define the seat 24. Thethreaded interconnection between the threaded portion 72 of body 52rotating in threads 22 of plunger assembly tube 16 is a very closetolerance and defines an effective gas-tight seal between the passagewaythrough tube 14 (through which gas flows) and the upper portion of thevalve plunger assembly 50—i.e., that portion of the valve plungerassembly outward of threaded portion 72. The threaded interconnection ofthe bonnet 64 with external threads 20 also define a secondary or backupgas-tight seal, combined with O-ring 82, which as noted previously,seals against shaft 58.
The plunger assembly 50 may be used for regulating or limiting flowthrough the valve assembly by varying the position of the distal end 54to thereby vary the size of the gas flow path through the valve.
The valve assembly 10 is a self sealing valve and defines two separatevalve closing components. The first valve sealing component is definedby the gas flow opening and closing function of the distal end 54 andvalve seat 24. This first valve sealing component is used to open,close, and regulate the flow of gas through valve assembly 10. Thesecond valve sealing component comprises a primary and a secondarysealing functionality. The first is defined by threads 72 from theplunger body 52, which seal off the valve and operational handle fromthe gas flow section of the valve assembly 10. The second is defined bythe bonnet 64, which as noted previously seals against upper shaftportion 58.
 The plunger body 52 is a one piece system fabricated from HDPE. This maybe contrasted with typical gate valves that utilize two or three pieceplunger or gate systems. The one piece design does not allow vibrationon the plunger during operation as with a typical two or three piecegate valve that can vibrate from the flow when not in the fully closedor fully open position.
Utilizing this one piece plunger design, valve assembly 10 has morerigidity when opening/closing the valve. This one piece plunger designis milled out of HDPE but is not limited to this material.
Other typical valves on the market have a separate female threadedplunger with a male threaded bonnet. In contrast, the valve assembly 10utilizes a male threaded plunger and a female threaded bonnet.
The valve assembly 10 also utilizes a different style of sealing designin the throat as compared to a typical gate valve. Thus, typical gatevalves seal using planar surfaces of the plunger against a complimentaryshaped lip inside the valve body; this typically results in obstructionof flow and build-up of debris. The valve assembly 10 described andillustrated herein utilizes a semi-hemispherical shaped plunger that isreceived in a complimentary shaped seat at the bottom of the housingbody; this ensures a solid seal around the plunger without obstructingflow. As shown in FIG. 8, the surface of the valve plunger that ispresented to fluid flow in the linear tubing 14 is always a curvedsurface.
The valve assembly 10 is manufactured out of HDPE material (excludinghandle 62 and the screws, pins used to attach the handle to the uppershaft 58). Because the entire valve is HDPE the valve may be fused intoplace permanently utilizing heat transfer welding techniques rather thanbolted, threaded, or glued into place as with other gate valves.
 The bonnet 64 also acts as a back up seal to threads 72 should thethreads 72 wear and start to leak.
In one preferred embodiment, the housing body 12 utilizes a 2″ HDPESDR-9 molded Tee. This tee is then custom milled inside the throat toreceive the one piece threaded plunger.
The one piece threaded plunger rotates in a cylindrical motionthroughout the entire travel area of the valve; with typical gatevalves, the plunger does not travel in the horizontal direction, insteadit only travels vertically while the plunger shaft rotates horizontally.
With typical valves, if the plunger travels linearly the plunger onlycomes in contact with the seat of the valve body when the valve isclosed; if the plunger is a rotating plunger it is always in contactwith the seat. The sealing portions of valve assembly 10—specifically,sealing portion 70, only comes in contact with the valve seat 24 whenthe valve is in the closed position, even though sealing portion 70 ofcourse rotates axially as the handle 62 is rotated.
 It will be appreciated that all of the components of the plungerassembly 50, and the assembly itself, may be replaced in the field ifthe unit is damaged or leaking. In addition to the embodiments describedabove that illustrate the invention, those of skill in the art willappreciate that various substitutions and alterations may be madewithout departing from the scope of the invention. As a first example,the shape of the distal end 114 of the plunger body 52, and thecorresponding cooperative shape of the valve seat 24 may be varied. Theshape shown in the drawings is described as being semi-hemispherical ingeometry. The end 114 could just as well be a complete hemisphere, inwhich case the valve seat 24 would be cooperatively shaped as ahemisphere. As a second example, the bonnet 64 described above threadsonto the external threads 20 of the plunger assembly tube 16. The bonnetcould just as well have external threads that thread into internalthreads in the tube 16.
While the present invention has been described in terms of preferred andillustrated embodiments, it will be appreciated by those of ordinaryskill that the spirit and scope of the invention is not limited to thoseembodiments, but extend to the various modifications and equivalents asdefined in the appended claims.

conduit post esophagectomy is a rare and often fatal complication. Case presentation: A 68 year old man underwent radical esophagectomy for esophageal
adenocarcinoma. On postoperative day 14 the nasogastric drainage bag dramatically filled with air,
without deterioration in respiratory function or progressive sepsis. A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was
performed which demonstrated a gastro-bronchial fistula in the posterior aspect of the left main
bronchus. He was managed conservatively with antibiotics, enteral nutrition via jejunostomy, and
non-invasive respiratory support. A follow- up bronchoscopy 60 days after the diagnostic
bronchoscopy, confirmed spontaneous closure of the fistula Conclusions: This is the first such case where a conservative approach with no surgery or
endoprosthesis resulted in a successful outcome, with fistula closure confirmed at subsequent
bronchoscopy. Our experience would suggest that in very carefully selected cases where
bronchopulmonary contamination from the fistula is minimal or absent, there is no associated
inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree and the patient is stable from a respiratory point of view
without evidence of sepsis, there may be a role for a trial of conservative management. tality despite advances in critical care and endoprostheses
[2]. We present herein a particularly rare case, a fistula
from the left main bronchus into a cervical esophagogas-
tric anastomosis, and discuss the presentation and the
approach to successful conservative management. Open

tosis of 15 × 109/L and evidence of left basal consolida-
tion. This persisted despite antibiotics, and a CT of thorax
demonstrated no other abnormalities. He was managed
on the ward, and his FiO2 varied from 0.4 to 0.6. Aspira-
tion pneumonia was considered possible, and his
nasogastric tube was left in situ. His neck wound was dry
with no signs of inflammation or leakage. Case Presentation On day 14 the
nasogastric drainage bag dramatically filled with air, and
this persisted throughout the day and succeeding days,
but without deterioration in respiratory function or evi-
dence of progressive sepsis. A fiberoptic bronchoscopy
was performed on day 16 which demonstrated bubbling
at a gastro-bronchial fistula in the posterior aspect of the
left main bronchus (Fig. 1). An endoscopy revealed a
healthy gastric tube but a tiny area of granulation tissue in
the anterior portion of the anastomosis, the assumed site
of fistula communication. A CT scan of the thorax demon-
strated air in the mediastinum and the gastric conduit

subsided, he was introduced to oral diet and progressed
well and was discharged. A follow- up bronchoscopy 60
days after the diagnostic bronchoscopy, confirmed spon-
taneous closure of the fistula (Fig. 3). Conclusions
h d
l The development of a fistula between the gastric tube and
the tracheobronchial tree represents a very rare but poten-
tially catastrophic complication after esophagogastros-
tomy for esophageal carcinoma. The commonest cause is
a leak from the esophagogastric intrathoracic anastomosis
with subsequent mediastinal abscess and rupture into the
posterior wall of the tracheobronchial tree. Anastomotic
leaks are responsible for approximately 40% of post-
esophagectomy deaths [1]. Clinically apparent thoracic
anastomotic leaks and fistulae are associated with a high
rate of mortality despite advances in critical care and
endoprostheses [2]. He was managed conservatively with antibiotics, enteral
nutrition via a jejunostomy, and non-invasive respiratory
support in the form of humidified oxygen via face mask
and chest physiotherapy. The huge amounts of air in the Most anastomotic leaks result from gastric ischemia, but

h d
l Potential mechanisms in this particular case
include the rendering vulnerable or ischemic of the tra-
cheobronchial tissue by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy,
combined with sharp dissection to radically remove all
sub-carinal nodal tissue, with consequent injury and
delayed rupture. This is the first case to our knowledge to
present in this fashion, where the primary source appears
to be the bronchus with the secondary consequence at the
anastomotic site. Generally, gastro-bronchial fistulae may
present in the early postoperative period or relatively late
in the follow-up, with management strategy influenced by
the site and size of the fistula, the underlying cause, and
the clinical presentation [4,5]. It has previously been pos-
tulated that untreated gastro-bronchial fistula is usually
fatal due to chronic pulmonary sepsis and that conserva-
tive treatment is inadvisable [6]. However, surgery is
fraught with high morbidity in these patients. Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the patient
for publication of this case report and any accompanying
images. A copy of the written consent is available for
review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal. The authors declare that they have no competing interests. The authors declare that they have no competing interests. The authors declare that they have no competing interests. Authors' contributions JMS was involved in the postoperative clinical manage-
ment and drafted the manuscript; JL was involved in the
postoperative clinical management and drafted the man-
uscript; FOC provided postoperative respiratory consulta-
tion and performed the bronchoscopies; NR performed
the surgery and oversaw the writing of the manuscript;
JVR performed the surgery, oversaw patient management
and edited the manuscript. All authors read and approved
the final manuscript. The commonest mode of presentation is cough after swal-
lowing, dyspnea, fever and recurrent pneumonia [7]. These are non-specific symptoms in the post-esophagec-
tomy period. In this case, the dramatic presentation of a
naso-gastric bag filling every two hours with air made the
diagnosis clinically obvious, and bronchoscopy estab-
lished the source. Stenting of the bronchus was consid-
ered, but the site of fistulation did not lend itself easily to
an endo-bronchial prosthesis. Endoscopy of the anasto-
mosis and stomach helped to establish that the stomach
was healthy, and predict that this would heal as long as
the bronchial leak settled. Self-expanding esophageal
endo-prostheses have been used successfully in patients
with anastomotic leaks after esophageal surgery [8], usu-
ally intra-thoracic leaks. Stent migration has been
reported in as many as 37.5% of patients. In this case, the
high anastomosis, 3 cm below the cricopharyngeus, and a
normal diameter nonstenotic anastomosis were consid-
ered to predict a high risk of stent failure so stenting was
not seriously entertained. Pre-publication history The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed

Article: Do I need to know assembly to debug programs written in C?
I am learning C with "The C Programming Language", 2nd edition, and also doing each exercise. 
Do I need to know assembly in order to debug C programs that I wrote as solutions to the books exercises?
Also, which debugger do you recommend?

No you don't, but it might be easier to learn than gdb!  ;-)

You do not need to know assembly to program in C, including debugging. However, if you know assembly, C begins to make a lot of sense; it really helps to have some notions of assembly (preferably, some notions on several distinct architectures, such as x86 and ARM), and not only for debugging.

Agreed.  Knowing how a machine really works helps you write better C.  Learning the assembly language will you help you grasp how a machine works at a low level and why you write the C that you do.

It is not required but sometimes is extremely helpful. If you're using MSVC++, just use the one in the IDE, it can show disassembly too.

No, you don't need to know assembly in order to learn C.
As far as debuggers go, perhaps the easiest choice is to use the debugger that's built into the IDE that you're using. On Windows, Microsoft Visual Studio is popular (there's a free version). Eclipse is another popular choice that's available on a number of platforms.
There are also command-line debuggers, such as gdb, but they'll be harder to get started with than a GUI-based one.

In order to debug step by step, it might be helpful, but not necessary, to know assembly. It also depends on the debugger if it is really necessary.
But there are other ways to debug a program, e.g. put printf() calls at strategic places.

No, asm is not required but helpful, like others have said, use a debugger... What others have not said, is that you could even use GDB, but be sure you disable compiler optimisations or debugging might be hard.

When you compile with the GCC -g2 or -g3 flag you can debug you program with GDB. Here you can find a short tutorial howto use GDB http://cs.baylor.edu/~donahoo/tools/gdb/tutorial.html and here you can find a somewhat more extensive tutorial http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/gdb/gdb_toc.html

You don't need to learn assembly if you are going to debug your own programs. Compilers can embed source code information into the executable (-g flag with GCC) or into a side file (/Z family of flags with MSVC).
Getting started with a debugger is not hard (even if you use a command line one), and there are plenty of resources everywhere on the internet. It is the investment which will give you the most return.
Nevertheless, having some grasp of the assembly language can prove useful at times. Looking at the assembly generated by the compiler is sometimes (rarely) needed when you want to check how some optimizations are done. But this is something you shouldn't worry about unless you have a very specific job.

No, you don't. Microsoft Visual Studio has a nice debugger. Other options are Code::Blocks or Eclipse.

Article: iOS iPhone app doesnt fill screen on iPad
I have an iOS app which resizes/looks fine between iPhone 4 through to iPhone 6s Plus. However, when I run the same app on any iPad device I get black bars on all sides of my view. I've tried several things to fix it but nothing has works. Here is what it looks like

I checked the following settings:

General>Deployment Info>Devices: iPhone
Autolayout turned on
Size Classes Disabled
No warnings in interface builder
Problem exists on ios 8.0 and 9.0
Works fine in iPhone devices
Xcode 7.2 (started project in Xcode 6.4)
Launch Screen.storyboard exists


You need to make your app UNIVERSAL. It is the third option after "iPhone" and "iPad". It means that it supposrts both.

@NicolasMiari why? I only want it to run on iPhone

Because that it how iPhone-only apps are displayed on iPad. Only "iPad" apps or "Universal" apps fill the whole iPad screen.

You can not prevent an iPhone-only app from being installed on an iPad: The iPad is designed to run iPhone-only apps in 1x or 2x mode since the beginning (it "simulates" the iPhone). The iPhone, on the other side, will not install iPad-only apps. That is how it works.

@NicolasMiari  even on 2x mode it doesnt fill the screen completely. Shouldnt it still fill the screen with the app in 2x mode?

No; 2x mode is just a "quick and dirty zoom", for convenience. It is still rendered as if running on an iPhone (originally, 320x480). iPhone and iPad have different aspect ratios,etc.

It is not supposed to fill the screen or otherwise fake a "true" iPad app.


I only want it to run on iPhone...
Paragraph 2.10 of App Store Review Guidelines

2.10
  iPhone Apps must also run on iPad without modification, at iPhone resolution, and at 2X iPhone 3GS resolution

iOS iPhone app doesn't fill screen on iPad
That is the definition of an app not targeted for iPad, as explained above in the accurate comments from @NicolasMiari.


On the other hand, if you have a genuine reason to not target iPad, because the hardware does not provide a key capability you need, you can explicitly request for that capability, and your app will not launch (nor be proposed on the App Store when browsed from that device).

Article: $Sin(nx)$ always 1?
It may seem naive, but, is there any value for $x$ in $$\sin(nx)$$ such that for any natural $n$, $\sin(nx)$ = $1$? 
I've tried quite a few values, and I seem to fail at avoiding it going to zero.
Or even to make it alternate between $-1$ and $1$
Surely it must be possible to do so?

Look at the graph.

What make you so "sure" it must be possible to do so? Surely you must have noted how for every such attempt either $\sin(x)\ne\pm1$ or $\sin(2x)=0$

$$\sin nx=1\iff nx=\frac\pi2+2k\pi.$$
This is impossible, as $n=1$ says
$$x=\frac\pi2+2k\pi,$$ and with $n=2$,
$$x=\frac\pi4+k'\pi.$$
Together,
$$\frac12+2k=\frac14+k'\ !$$

Why $k'$ factorial? :)

@S.C.B.: haha...

No, it is not possible for $\sin nx=0$ for all $n$. 
If $\sin x=1$, from $\cos^2 x=1-\sin^2 x=0$,  we know that $\cos x=0$ if $\sin x=1$. But since $$\sin 2x=2 \sin x \cos x=2 \times 1 \times 0$$
Hence, $\sin 2x=0$ if $\sin x=1$, and since if fails at the natural $2$, what you're trying is impossible. 

Note that this argument works even if we allow $x$ to have complex value. Even in the complex case we have $\cos^2 z = 1-\sin^2 z$ and $\sin 2z = 2\sin z\cos z$ so if $\sin z=\pm 1$ we must have $\sin 2z=0$.


Is there any value for $x$ in $$\sin(nx)$$ such that for any natural $n$, $\sin(nx)$ = $1$? 

I'm assuming $\mathbb{N}$ to include $0$, then no: because for any $x$, you will always have
$$\sin(0x) = \sin 0 = 0 \quad \mbox{for} \quad n=0$$
You can achieve what you're looking for (a 'suitable' $x$) if you allow something of the form:
$$\sin\left( \tfrac{\pi}{2} + nx\right)$$

Addition after comment, since you seem to exclude $0$.
If you want $\sin(nx)=1$ for all $n$, taking $n=1$ implies that $x$ has to be of the form $\tfrac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi$ with $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. But taking $n=2$ implies $x$ has to be of the form $\tfrac{\pi}{4}+k\pi$ and no $x$ can be of both forms.

It says natural $n$. I don't think $0$ is a natural.

$n$ being in the naturals. I'm avoiding $n=0$

$0$ is a natural and not a natural

@S.C.B. I assumed 'naturals' to include $0$ but your comment reminded me that this is not universal; I'll add this caveat.

Article: Create a new class and load some copies of it into the view
Ok, i made a small application with a small ball bouncing on the screen. That was esay.
Now i'd like to have more than one ball... so i think the best way is to create a new class : the ball.
How can i do it?
Thanks!

encapsulate the information about the ball from your first app into variables, and create methods for any actions you think the ball performs.  This sounds a lot like an object-oriented design problem..perhaps you should take a look at an Object Oriented Programming guide, such as this one OOP Guide
but if you are asking how to create a custom object class.. 
put this in your Ball.h: 
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface Ball : NSObject {

    IBOutlet UIButton *button; //sample instance variable
}

@property  (retain) UIButton *button;
@end

then in your .m file:
#import "Ball.h"

@implementation Ball
@synthesize button;

-(void)dealloc
{
[button release];
[super dealloc];
}

@end


Hi Jesse, thank you very much for your answer.
I'll try to be more precise about my problem:
This "ball" should be associated to an image of a ball. I made this in Interface Builder, doing like this:

Loaded a png file in Xcode
Created an IBOutlet UIImageView named "ball"
In Interface Builder, I have added a UIImageView on the main view and linked it to "ball".
Added some methods
*Everything working fine.

But now, with the class, how can I do the same things?
I'd like to pick my png image and associate it to every instance of Ball, and have it on my view.
Thanks!

Article: If any merchant in this day and time were to do the same thing, a thousand “certified accountants” would proceed to prove that he was headed for hopeless bankruptcy, yet that old Texas pioneer and patriot, living much of the time a hundred miles from a railroad, in a village amid the primeval forests of East Texas, built up and transmitted to his worthy posterity a hand- some estate. Cc. B. STEWART. Dr. C. B. Stewart of Montgomery County, was another signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence. He lived for many years in Montgomery County, and died there. I am under the impression that he left quite a large landed es- tate. I have seen him often. He was very deaf, and always car- ried an ear trumpet, almost as large as a trombone. He was a man of high character, and commanded universal confidence and respect. I have no doubt that if it were possible to take the names of the fifty-three signers of the Declaration of Independence, and study their characters and trace their careers, there would be revealed, as to most of them, if not all of them, that they were efficient, honorable men, and worthy citizens. There is a substantial basis for such belief. In the first place, none but courageous, virile, self-reliant men ever go out as pio- neers into a vast unknown and untenanted domain, for the pur- pose of subduing it to the purposes of civilization and establish- ing free and stable government. It is only that character of men who are ready and willing to dare the dangers, and endure the hardships involved in such an undertaking, and success is dependent upon mutual fidelity and honor upon the part of all who unite for such a purpose. It requires, too, practical men to achieve success in such an undertaking. They must needs be men with vision, of course, but possessed also of the ability, judgment, and foresight to translate their visions into realities. The man who is devoid of physical or moral courage, or who is a seer of visions and a dreamer of dreams, but is without practical ability, has no place in such a body of men. Those fifty-three men on the banks of the Brazos on March 2, 1836, representing at the outside only about 30,000 people, threw down the gauntlet of defiance to a nation of 7,000,000, and de- clared that they were and had the right to be free and inde- pendent; and they made that declaration good seven weeks later. Such men had the courage and judgment and efficiency neces- sary to success in any field of activity, and it is not surprising 136 GOVERNORS WHO HAVE BEEN that they not only achieved success in the sphere of business en- terprise, and left a posterity worthy of such an ancestry, but left to that posterity legacies of great material value, but of less value, and less to be esteemed, than is their example of patriotism, cour- age and fidelity to duty. THE FISHERS, BRYANS, AUSTIN, BEE AND CROCKETT. Another signer of the Declaration of Independence was S. Rhoads Fisher, who came to Texas in the early days. He bore an active and useful part in the establishment of the Republic and in formulating its policies. He was a man of liberal learning, and literary culture, and a gentleman by birth and breed- ing. He and General Sam Houston had some differences at one time over some public question, and he sent the General a chal- lenge to fight a duel, but the matter was adjusted in some honor- able way, and the cordial personal relations of the two as they existed before, were entirely restored, and were never again disturbed. The duello was not an unheard of method of settling questions of differences in those days. As I recall, from either having heard it or read of it. General Felix Huston and General Albert Sidney Johnston fought a duel at a very early day, and General Johnston was wounded in the hip. It is said that General Houston fought a duel in Tennessee with one Judge White, who was so dangerously wounded as to have made his recovery doubtful for a long time, and it may have been that fact which influenced General Houston to not desire to again adopt that method of settling a personal difference. Personally, I have always believed that a duel -was a most fool- ish way to determine any question, and no duellist ever chal- lenged my admiration, but many better men than I am, were earnest advocates of the practice. I am told that that brilliant man, Henry A. Wise of Virginia, believed in the duel to the last day of his life. ; It took more courage, in my judgment, to decline a challenge than it did to fight one, when the custom prevailed of fighting duels. A friend of mine, who served under General Forrest, per- haps as a courier on his staff, told me that General Earl Van Dorn, a fiery, hot-blooded Southern soldier, once challenged Gen- eral Forrest to a duel. General Forrest said: “General Van Dorn, no man doubts your courage or mine, and it is not necessary for us to go out and shoot, or shoot at, each other to prove our courage. Furthermore, there is an army of the enemy of our common country in front of us, and it is our duty to fight it, and not each other, therefore, your challenge is declined.” AND OTHER PUBLIC MEN OF TEXAS 137 Nathan Bedford Forrest was the greatest cavalry leader the world ever saw, and was courage incarnate, but never, when he rode with nodding plume and flashing saber amid the hell and hail of battle, as he did on many a bloody field, did he display a higher type of courage than when he declined the challenge of his younger fellow soldier. S. Rhoads Fisher was the father of Rhoads Fisher, who was for sO many years connected with the General Land Office of Texas, and who died in the comparatively recent past, and whose son Hon. Lewis Fisher, was, for a number of years, the very efficient judge of one of the District Courts of Galveston, and later was Mayor of that city. Judge Fisher’s wife is the granddaughter of James Wilmer Dallam, the reporter of Dallam’s decisions. So far as my knowledge, acquired either by reading or by tradi- tion, or otherwise, extends, the descendants of every Texas vet- eran have reflected credit on their ancestry. The interpreter between Santa Anna and Sam Houston, as the latter lay wounded on the battle field of San Jacinto, was Moses Austin Bryan. He lived to a ripe old age, respected and venerated by all who knew him. One of his sons was, for a number of years, Judge of the 21st Judicial District of Texas, and another son, Louis R. Bryan, has been President of the Texas State Bar Association and is now a resident of Houston, and is one of the most efficient and capable lawyers at the bar of Texas. The son of L. R. Bryan, L. R. Bryan, Jr., now assistant cash- jer of the Lumbermans National Bank of Houston, sprang to an- swer his country’s call and went overseas and took his place where death held high carnival, and stayed until the last shot was fired. He bore himself as might have been expected of one in whose veins runs the blood of the patriot, Moses Austin Bryan, his pa- ternal grandfather, and the blood of that princely gentleman, Chauncey B. Shepard, his maternal grandfather, and one who was of the same race and lineage of that knightly soul, Seth Shepard, who, when a mere boy, went out to do battle in defense of his native Southland. There is one name connected with Texas history which stands pre-eminent in the calendar of Texas patriots, that of Stephen F. Austin who, Sam Houston said, was justly entitled to be called “The Father of Texas.” He was never married, and died at a comparatively early age, but he had sisters, or at least one sister, who came to Texas at a very early day and his collateral kindred have always been and are yet among the worthiest citizenship of Texas. The names of the Perry and the Bryan families, all of whom were of his kin 138 GOVERNORS WHO HAVE BEEN by consanguinity or affinity, have always been synonyms of social and moral worth, and exalted character. My friend, Hon. E. T. Branch, Criminal District Attorney of Harris County, a grandson of a noble Texas pioneer, gave me, a few years ago, a number of autograph letters of Stephen F. Aus- tin, which I cherish as a treasure beyond all price. One of the letters, written to a relative, I believe a sister, re- veals that he was urged to go to Mexico City to endeavor by ne- gotiations with the administration of the republic of Mexico, of which Texas, a Mexican State, was then a part, to get relief from certain oppressive government regulations, the exact nature of which I do not now recall, and the letter is not at hand as I write. He said he did not want to go, but wanted to settle down on his farm near his sister and rest, and was further desirous of not undertaking the journey, because it would cost him much money, which he would not be able to get back. On the margin of the letter there is written in pencil by some relative a memorandum to the effect that the money was never returned. He made the journey—not in Pullman cars, paying 3 cents a mile, and getting 20 cents from his government—but went across trackless plains, haunted by savages, through primeval forests, and miasmatic swamps on a mission of patriotism, and the hall of his reception was a dungeon, and he came back broken in health, and. soon passed away. He was essentially a Texas pioneer, though never a Governor or judge or general, yet but for him and his compatriots, there would have been no Texas such as there is today. They gave Texas to the world, and with their own hands, nerved by their brave hearts, wrote their own glorious record. Yet there are people, even in Texas, who speak of them with ill- concealed sneers, yet the names of those who made possible this imperial commonwealth will live in song and story when those who disparage their achievements, shall have sunk into an obliv- ion from which no trumpet will ever awake them to resurrec- tion. : His nephew, Hon. Guy Morrison Bryan, whom I knew, and who was a most estimable gentleman, was elected to the Legislature of Texas in 1848, to the State Senate a few years later, to Congress in 1857, and was Speaker of the House of Representatives of Texas in 1873, and again a member of the House in 1878. He married a daughter of William H. Jack, who fought at the Battle of San Jacinto as a private and later achieved distinction in official station, and at the bar. His son, Guy M. Bryan, Jr., a grand-nephew of Stephen F. Aus- tin, is an executive officer of one of the leading banks of Hous- ton, and a justly respected citizen. AND OTHER PUBLIC MEN OF TEXAS 139 General Hamilton P. Bee came to Texas at 15 years of age, when his father, Bernard E. Bee, was holding the position of Sec- retary of War of the Republic. His brother, Bernard E. Bee, christened General T. J. Jackson “Stonewall,” just before he (General Bee) while leading his in- trepid South Carolinians and waving his gleaming sword, pre- sented to him by the State of South Carolina, fell at first Manassas. General Hamilton P. Bee was Speaker of the House of Repre- sentatives of Texas at 34 years of age—a position to which my father helped elect him. He was a gallant Confederate soldier, and a cultured gentleman. As late as the administration of Governor Ireland he served as Commissioner of Insurance, Statistics and History. His son, Carlos P. Bee, has filled the position of District Attor- ney and State Senator, and is now a member of Congress from Texas. I did not, and do not cherish the purpose to elaborate on this special theme, but it seems to me to be germane to my main theme of Governors, Legislators and Jurists, to show what manner of men those were who transmitted to us so splendid a heritage. By the operation of the same divine and unerring law which transmits the penalties for ill-lived lives and blessings for lives lived uprightly and in the fear of God “to the third and fourth generations” the splendid qualities and sturdy virtues which made noble and admirable the characters of their fathers have been transmitted to the descendants of the early pioneers of Texas, and have so dowered them that they have stood every test of service, and proved themselves worthy sons of noble sires. It may be thought by some who read these pages, that I stress too greatly the subject of the early Texas pioneers, and some reader may infer that I claim descent from some one of that heroic band, but I do not. I came to Texas, an infant in my mother’s arms, long after they had wrought their great work, but I would deem myself unwor- thy to be a Texan if I did not appreciate their great achieve- ments. and admire their noble characters. They were brave soldiers, unselfish patriots, farseeing states- men, endowed with great constructive ability, and they left to those of us who now live and generations yet unborn, the richest, noblest heritage ever bequeathed by valor and statesmanship to coming generations. I regret that I can not clam to be “kindred to the blood” of any of them, but I am proud to be able to say that my three sons are the great nephews and my three daughters the great nieces of Davy Crockett. I had rather they should be of kin to him than to any king or prince that ever wielded a scepter, or wore a crown. 140 GOVERNORS WHO HAVE BEEN He wore a coonskin hunting cap, and a buckskin hunting shirt, but that coonskin cap covered a clear brain and a level head, and under that buckskin hunting shirt, throbbed as heroic a heart as ever poured out its rich, red blood that liberty might live. He was not cultured nor highly educated, but he lived uprightly and wrought nobly. He was one of the bold, brave leaders who blazed the way for the advancing cohorts of. civilization and progress. He lived as became a man, in the highest sense of that term, and like a man, he died. He fell fighting to the last at the foot of a statue of the Prince of Peace, within the consecrated walls of the Alamo, and of him it can be truly said: “He taught men how to live, and Oh, too high A price for knowledge, taught men how to die.” That man, I care not who he may be, that speaks, or even thinks, in terms of disparagement of the fathers and founders of Texas, is unworthy to share in the fruits of their faithful services and heroic sacrifices; and ought to take his feet off the soil they con- secrated by their devotion and hallowed by their blood, and go elsewhere to live, if he purposes to longer cumber the earth with his unworthy presence. AND OTHER PUBLIC MEN OF TEXAS 141 EAST TEXAS MEN. CHAPTER XXIV. I have never enjoyed an extensive acquaintance in North Texas, but was reared in the piney woods of East Texas. It has been my good fortune to know many of the prominent men of that sec- tion, which was settled and in the enjoyment of many of the benefits and blessings of civilization and refined society, when the red man roamed over North, Northwest and West Texas, but now those parts of Texas which were settled last, have developed with marvelous rapidity, and a great future for them is kindling in splendor. If time and space permitted, it would be a pleasure to deal with the name of every East Texas man who has held public po- sition. The list is worthy of being perpetuated, though writing wholly from memory, I may omit some as worthy as were those I remember, and I shall not undertake to name all of those. I never saw General Thomas J. Rusk, so far as I know. His career ended when I was a mere child. He commanded a wing of the Texas Army at San Jacinto, and when Texas became a part of the Union, represented her in the United States Senate, and at the time of his death, was Chairman of the Committee on Postoffices and Postroads. His home was in Nacogdoches. Frank W. Bowden was, I believe, from Anderson County, and I once heard Governor Roberts say he was the most eloquent man ever in Texas. Colonel Frank B. Sexton of Marshall, but later of El Paso, was a typical Southern gentleman, of stately, courtly manners and the highest personal character. He was elected to the Confederate Congress during the war be- tween the states, and was for many years attorney of the T. & P. Railway. He was a contemporary at the bar of that able lawyer Wm. Stedman of Marshall, whose mantle as a lawyer descended upon the worthy shoulders of his son, N. A. Stedman, who served at one time on the Railroad Commission, and also as District Judge at Fort Worth, and has for a number of years, represented the allied railway interests of Texas. Tyler is by no means a large city, and until within the com- paratively recent past had hardly arrived at the dignity of a city, but it has furnished to the bar of Texas a greater number of able lawyers than has any single town or city within my knowledge in proportion to its population: Micajah H. Bonner, G. W. Chil- ton, John M. Duncan, one of the most graceful and skillful trial 142 GOVERNORS WHO HAVE BEEN lawyers that ever appeared before me; Cone Johnson, lawyer and orator; Horace Chilton, John L. Henry, Tignal W. Jones, John C. Robertson, Sawnie Robertson, H. G. Robertson, T. N. Jones, N. W. Finley, one of the ablest judges ever on the bench of the Civil Appeals Court; Henry B. Marsh, W. S. Herndon, J. S. Hogg, R. B. Hubbard, and A. G. McIlwaine and J. M. Edwards are, or ‘were, all Tyler men, and there is not one of the list who is not above the average in legal ability, while some are, or were, among the ablest lawyers at the bar of Texas. Even in the small towns, mere villages, were able lawyers. Colonel E. B. Pickett, once Lieutenant Governor, and Hon. Chas. L. Cleveland, both lived at Liberty. The latter was at one time District Judge, later a partner for many years in Galveston of Asa Hoxie Willie, and died in the office of Criminal District Judge of Harris and Galveston Counties. I was in Houston when he died, having gone there to sit for him during his illness. Both Colonel Pickett and Judge Cleveland were able lawyers and E. B. Pickett, Jr., grandson of Colonel Pickett, who may proberly be called E. B. Pickett III, is a young lawyer of recog- nized ability. Judge Jas. A. Baker and Leonard A. Abercrombie were both from Huntsville and both were able lawyers. Judge Baker was, during the Civil War, judge of the same district of which Judge Peter W. Gray was judge prior to the war. He, after the war, about 1872, became a partner of Judge Gray, and the firm of Gray, Botts & Baker by the death of all the original partners, and the accession of others, is now the firm of Baker, Botts, Parker & Garwood. At one time or another nearly every member of the firm has practiced before me, and all without exception, have demonstrated marked efficiency as lawyers. I heard the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas say re- cently that a case in which Jesse Andrews, Esq., of the firm ap- peared on one, the winning side, and Morris R. Locke, Esq., of Dallas, on the other, prepared the briefs, was the best briefed case he had ever examined, and other appellate judges who han- dled the record, have told me the same. The head of the firm, Captain Jas. A. Baker, combines legal knowledge, the ability to advise wisely, and rare financial ability, a most unusual combination. I have frequently recalled a remark made to me by Judge Baker before I began to practice law, to the effect that he meant to train his son for the corporation practice, as it was “destined to be the future field of profitable practice.” The language was prophetic, as the statement was made before Judge Baker went to Houston to live. The son is now the executive head of a firm which was, in a large sense, founded by an East Texas lawyer, AND OTHER PUBLIC MEN OF TEXAS 143 which firm represents more corporate and commercial interests than any other in Texas, if not in the South. I knew Judge Baker from my earliest boyhood. He and my father were near neighbors and close friends. Both were fond of good company, were famous raconteurs, and Judge Baker played the violin beautifully, and was a man of great social charm. Leonard A. Abercrombie resigned the office of District Attor- ney to enter the Confederate Army, in which he held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and from which he returned utterly impov- erished. He was, take him all in all, one of the ablest, most re- sourceful and skillful trial lawyers in civil or criminal cases I ever saw. I read law in his office, and he practiced law before me for nearly seven years, and was a courtly gentleman of the most exalted character, and the most faithful friend ever a man had. One of the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals nominated at Galveston in 1876 after the enactment of the Constitution which created the Court, was Malcolm D. Ector of Marshall, Texas. He was one of the 20th District Judges who were removed from office in 1867. He commanded a brigade in the Confederate Army and lost a leg above the knee in one of the bloody battles in Tennessee, probably the battle of Franklin. His nomination was part of the fruits of the appeal made by Geo. P. Finlay for recognition and reward of Confederate Vet- erans, to which I referred to in a previous chapter. He was an elegant gentleman, and served most efficiently as Presiding Judge of the Court until the fall of 1879, when he died, and was suc- ceeded by Hon. George Clark, who was appointed by Governor Roberts. In August, 1880, Judge Clark was defeated at Dallas by the Hon. Jas. M. Hurt. It is said when Judge Roberts heard the result of the balloting, he said: “I can beat ’em making judges.” I think it very likely that he, like myself, had never heard of Judge Hurt before, for experience soon demonstrated that though a very able man was defeated, the one who was selected made a great judge. © ROBERT M. WILLIAMSON. There will be in all likelihood many who will read this humble volume who will not recognize the man, the outlines of whose life and character are the theme of this sketch, by the name which heads it. If I had used the phrase “Three-Legged Willie,” there would be few who vould not at once identify the subject. When he first arrived in Texas he was called “Mr. Willie.” After James Willie came, he and R. M. Williamson were boon companions. James 144 GOVERNORS WHO HAVE BEEN Willie was an older brother of the late Asa Hoxie Willie who was, from 1882 to 1888, the most efficient Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas. James Willie at one time, was Attorney General of the State, and was the author of the Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure of Texas, which is surpassed by no work of the kind in all the range of the literature of the criminal law. When a boy about 15 years of age, R. M. Williamson suffered an attack of white swelling in his left leg, with the result that the leg was bent back from the knee, and from the knee down he had a wooden leg. That affliction is clearly revealed by an examination of the full length portrait of him which hangs in the Senate Chamber of Texas. To distinguish him from “Jim Willie’ the Mexicans called him “Mr. Three-Legged Willie,’ which sobriquet was commonly adopted, and he was so known until his death. Many people did not even know that his real name was “Williamson.” I confess that I did not know that fact until many years after he had passed away. I do not know with what measure of accuracy the portrait referred to portrays the real man, but it clearly reveals a dominant, forceful character, and it is sure that his “counterfeit” presentment fitly fills a place in the Valhalla of Texas heroes. Robert M. Williamson, though born in Georgia, came to Texas from Alabama in 1826. In that day the code duello was recog- nized and all differences involving questions of honor were set- tled among gentlemen in accordance with its provisions, and on the field of honor young Williamson fatally wounded his antag- onist, who had committed the one offense, which in that day and time, was, and it is to be hoped yet is, unforgivable—that of in- dulging in remarks which reflected upon the moral character of a young lady. Robert M. Williamson was, in a large sense, a fair type of the intelligent, resourceful, efficient pioneer, but he was not an ordinary pioneer, who was content with a few cattle, and a free range, and hunting and fishing opportunities ad libitum, for he was in no sense an ordinary man. His vision was broad, and he aspired to worthy achievements. It may be appropriate to set forth in this connection my views concerning the leaders among the early Texans for whose char- acters and achievements my admiration is intense. There were many remarkable men who came to Texas at a very early day—men, who by reason of their courage, intellect and force of character, would have left the impress of their per- sonality upon any country in any age of the world. Coming as they did into a territory covering an area of more than 350,000 square miles, and with less than one inhabitant to each ten AND OTHER PUBLIC MEN OF TEXAS 145 square miles, they of course ventured into a virgin realm, and were pioneers in the fullest and truest sense of that term. They knew when they prepared to come that they would be compelled to face dangers and undergo hardships, and be com- pelled to live among crude surroundings in so far as concerned their places of residence and their local environment. They knew that the conveniences and comforts of life would be few, and that of luxuries there would be none. They knew, too, they would have not only to establish homes, but organize a govern- ment. Any man who entertains the view that the men who laid the foundations of Texas were rude, reckless, ignorant adven- turers, embarking on, so to speak, a pioneering lark, because they either thirsted for excitement, or desired to reap profit by ex- ploitation of a new land, sadly errs. They came to Texas because they were far-seeing men. They rightly reasoned that a realm of such marvelous resources was destined to be settled speedily and afford homes in the course of one or more generations to many millions of people, and the splendid, but practical vision that filled their waking dreams has become a marvelous reality. We, of this generation, are their debtors, as heirs to the heritage which they bequeathed us. There are many people who find it hard to believe that as far back as 1826—nearly a century ago—when Judge Williamson came to Texas, there were really any men of classical education, statesmanlike capacity, oratorical power, or legal ability to be found here, or that such men came here until many years later. Such people seem unable to associate culture, ability and capacity for legislation and organization with virgin forests and tents and log cabins and the general crudeness which characterizes all pioneer settlements. They seem to think that civilization and all the refinements and luxuries which wealth make possible are necessary to intellectual development, and the production of statesmen, whereas the con- trary is true. The enervating influences and habits of modern- day society do not call into full play those qualities which make for constructive statesmanship. Statesmen who would have re- flected honor upon any legislative assembly in the world lived in the early days of Texas in log cabins with wives who would have graced the courts of kings. In rude court houses built of logs, and not infrequently before juries who sat on the ground under the shade of forest trees, pio- neer Texas lawyers delivered speeches as great in all the ele- ments of oratory as are any of those perpetuated in rare volumes as the greatest specimens of orators in bygone ages. The slightest intelligent reflection cannot fail to show that it was impossible for the work wrought in Texas between 1825 and 1845 to have been the work of any but able, far-seeing, progres- 146 GOVERNORS WHO HAVE BEEN sive, courageous men, who were familiar with the fundamental principles of right and justice upon which alone free govern- ment can safely rest. In the ranks of those who undertook to open to civilization a virgin realm covering so vast an area, there was no place for the intellectual, physical or moral weakling. It was, if a slang phrase be permissible, essentially ‘‘a man’s job.” In this connection, I take the liberty to borrow my own lan- guage used in an address once delivered by me before a joint ses- sion of the legislature of Texas on “Sam Houston: Virginian- Tennessean-Texan.” “Only such men as I have named could have achieved the task which they so successfully accomplished. Primeval forests filled with wild beasts and almost limitless plains over which bloodthirsty savages roamed in unhampered freedom, offered no attraction to small men, or to men who lacked in either physical or moral courage. The weak and hesi- tant man never pioneers, but waits until his bolder fellows have blazed the way and opened the path for the army of progress. Such men as I have named were not only courageous men, but they were men of education, culture and capacity for participa- tion in the affairs of government. They were endowed with the elements of leadership, and were so intellectually and morally gifted as to be able to leave to posterity a record of achievement in the sphere of statesmanship rarely excelled in any age, and enduring proof that they were as far-seeing, efficient and patri- otic statesmen as ever laid the foundation, shaped the policies, or directed the destinies of a new nation.” Robert M. Williamson made a place here for himself, which was peculiarly his own, and kept it to his life’s end. Nature had endowed him with rare qualities and gifts. He was the personi- fication of independence, was courage incarnate, and possessed in a pre-eminent measure that “divine afflatus” which is as surely the dowry of the orator as it is of the poet; and was given the fairly earned title of “the Patrick Henry of Texas.” He. held, before the republic was organized, the position of Alcalde, and after the republic came into existence, was one of the first district judges and ex-officio a member of the first Supreme Court. He lived first in East Texas, later at Old Wash- ington, where the Declaration of Texas Independence was signed, and died in Wharton, Texas, in 1859. The time which, but for his physical infirmity, he would doubtless have given in large part to youthful sports, he devoted to study, and was in consequence thoroughly familiar with the ancient Greek and Latin classics. The marvelous expansion of Texas as relates to her judiciary cannot be more strikingly shown than by the statement that under the Constitution of 1836, the judiciary consisted of a Supreme AND OTHER PUBLIC MEN OF TEXAS 147 Court and not exceeding eight District Courts, with one judge to each, and every District Judge was ex-officio a member of the Supreme Court, but no judge could sit as a Supreme Judge in any case which had been tried before him as District Judge. I have been informed that when the judiciary system was first organized there were only four judges of the Supreme Court, James Collingsworth being Chief Justice. Judge Williamson was one of the District Judges, but I am not able to say who the other two were. Later, the Chief Justice was T. J. Rusk and Judges Hemphill, Mills, Shelby, Jones, Hutchinson, Jack, Morris, Baylor, and Ochiltree were members of the court. When Chief Justice Rusk retired from the bench John Hemphill became Chief Justice. There are now approximately, if not fully, ninety District Courts and nine intermediate courts of Civil Appeals, a Supreme Court having jurisdiction of only civil cases, a Commission of Appeals to assist the Supreme Court, and a Court of Criminal Appeals. Any man who met the requirements of judicial position in the late thirties in East Texas had to possess a rare combination of qualities. He had to have ability, integrity and the highest type’ of courage, with all of which Judge Williamson was prodigally endowed. In those days most lawyers drank more or less, many to excess. It was considered by no means unethical for a lawyer at the bar to appear in court under the influence of strong drink. I have heard it said that on one occasion in a rude frontier court house a lawyer who had imbibed far too freely stated a proposition of law which did not at all commend itself to Judge Wiliamson; on the contrary, he deemed it wholly unsupported by either princi- ple or precedent. Such being his conviction, he said in his sharp, keen, penetrating tones: “Where do you find any law to sustain such a proposition?’ The bibulous barrister, reaching down to his side, drew out a dirk of prodigious length and driv- ing the point in the small pine table behind which he stood, said: “Hic!” There’s the law!” As quick as a flash, the judge dropped a six-shooter across the edge of the judge’s stand and said: “Yes, and by G—4d, here’s the Constitution.” The organic law prevailed on ‘that occasion. Like most, or at least many, men of great intellectual endowment and strong convictions, he was inclined to be intolerant of opposition, but fought out in the open against all opponents, fearing none. Very soon after the republic became a state, steps were taken to locate and build a penitentiary—a step to which for some rea- son Judge Williamson was strongly opposed. If I am correct in my recollection, the penitentiary was established at Huntsville in 1849. A very able member of the House from Galveston, who is yet 148 GOVERNORS WHO HAVE BEEN remembered there by the oldest citizens, championed the peniten- tiary bill, and had a safe majority in the House with him. The nearer Judge Williamson drew to defeat, and the more hopeless seemed the cause which he espoused, the fiercer his opposition grew, and the peroration of his final assault on the bill is said to have been in these words: “Mr. Speaker: If the gentleman is so anxious to have a penitentiary, he should be willing to get it the easiest and cheapest way possible, and I will point out the way. Fence in and cover over Galveston island, a long, low, sandy deso- late storm-swept and sea-bound waste, once the abode of Lafitte and his pirate band, and now the abiding place of the lordliest set of d d scoundrels these blue eyes ever blazed on.” Judge Williamson was one of the men who signed the first call for a convention to be held for the purpose of protesting against Mexican rule, and of taking steps to establish the Republic of Texas. The Mexican government offered a reward for the cap- ture of each of the signers, among whom were Francis Johnson and Lorenzo De Zavala. He participated in the opening fight of the revolution at Gonzales, and was a captain during the revolu- tion and took part in the Battle of San Jacinto, and was one of the framers of the Constitution of 1836. He held the first court ever held under that Constitution in his district, which extended from Washington County to San Augus- tine County, and held under the shade of a tree the first court ever held in the latter county. From 1840 to 1845, he was a mem- ber of the Congress of the Republic. He took part in enacting that provision setting apart to every head of a family a homestead, which could not be taken for debt, the first statute of the kind ever enacted by any legislative body in all the history of the world. He and his contemporaries and colleagues who directed the negotiations for annexation retained for Texas her ownership and sovereignty of all her public domain, one-half of which they set apart for the purpose of free public education of coming gen- erations The message of the then President of the Republic, the cultured and scholarly Lamar, ‘upon the subject of education was, and yet remains, a literary classic. They also provided in terms, which renders any interpreta- tion unnecessary, that Texas should never be divided without the sovereign consent of her own people—and the mathematics of humanity have no calculus to compute the time of the coming of the division of Texas, nor will the world ever behold the mournful spectacle of the suicide of a sovereign state. A son of Judge Williamson, Captain Willie Williamson, named for his father’s early day friend, James Willie, was a gallant Con- federate Captain when he had barely attained his majority, and was for many years after the close of the war between the states AND OTHER PUBLIC MEN OF TEXAS 149 a successful commercial traveler. I esteemed it a delightful privilege to be able to claim friendship with his noble wife and himself. His son, J. D. Williamson, a grandson of Judge Williamson, is one of the most efficient and successful members of the excep- tionably able bar of the city of Waco. Find them where you may, and in any sphere of professional or brsiness activity, the descendants of early Texans have always “maaoe good.” Those qualities which make for efficiency, insure success and inspire respect are inherited endowments, and rare- ly, if ever, has the law of heredity operated with greater cer- tainty than in the case of the descendants of the men whose names are honorably associated with that of the young republic which eventuated into the sovereign state, the imperial common- wealth of Texas, which every intelligent man knows is destined at some not far distant day to forcefully effect, if indeed it does not dominate, control and direct the industrial, commercial, economic and political destinies of this, the greatest nation ever on the earth. LOUIS T. WIGFALL. Another East Texas man who left the impress of his intellect and courage upon the era in which he lived, was Louis Treze- vant Wigfall, a much misunderstood man. If I am not mistaken, he lived in Harrison county. He and my father were members of the legislature at the same time. He was considered by many as a kind of “stormy petrel” in politics, who rejoiced in arousing and inflaming public sentiment on the se- cession question, and there were those who thought that beyond his ability as a stump speaker, he possessed no great degree of ability. Such an estimate was grossly erroneous. I have reason to know that among the Northern people he was looked upon as being one of the most (in their eyes) offensive secessionists. That he was a secessionist of the most ardent type there is no doubt, but when the die was cast and war came on he went to the front with Hood’s Brigade. I make the statement concerning how he was looked upon in the North on the faith of the following incident: I resided when beginning the practice of law in Galveston and was often the guest in the hospitable home of Hon. Wm. Pitt Bal- linger, then the nestor of the Texas Bar, a most estimable and delightful man. On one occasion the Hon. Samuel Freeman Miller, Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, was a visitor to that home -with his family for a week or more. If I am not mistaken, Judge Miller’s first wife was a sister of Judge Ballinger—in any event, they were warm personal friends. Judge Miller was an intense Republican in political belief, and, 150 GOVERNORS WHO HAVE BEEN using the term “smart” in the sense of intellectual, was one of the smartest men I ever met. He was, as all lawyers know, a great lawyer and a great judge. He was a physician, I have heard until he was 32 years of age, and within fifteen years from the time he put aside his pill bags was on the Supreme Bench of the United States. On one occasion in Judge Ballinger’s home they were discussing past events, including the war and secession, and finally Judge Miller said: “Oh, Ballinger, it is not surprising that you had secession and war and all your troubles when you had as lead- ers and Senators such blatherskites and demagogues as Wigfall and other men of his kind.” Judge Ballinger had never been a Democrat in political faith, and he was opposed to secession, but he was a patriot and stood by his people, and he did not let the attack on one of their leaders go unchallenged. It was really amusing to hear those two distinguished men quarrel like school- boys. Judge Ballinger countered on his guest by saying: ‘“Mil- ler, you don’t know what you are talking about. If there was one man who was essentially not a demagogue that man was Louis T. Wigfall. He was an aristocrat of aristocrats, and a patrician of patricians. “When he was a candidate before the Legislature for United States Senator he stood in the hall between the door of the House and Senate in company with a friend. As the legislators filed in he said to his friend: ‘A lot of those fellows are fine specimens of legislators to be vested with the power of electing a gentleman to the United States Senate.’ “The friend said: ‘Say, Wigfall, you are very indiscreet. Those men hold your political fate in their hands.’ He replied: ‘I don’t care a d n. The fact remains that a whole lot of ’em are copperas breeched hayseeds and have no business here.’ ” Every lawyer knows that the members of the Supreme Court of the United States have their own standard of judging of the ability - and distinction of a lawyer, and that is he must have appeared before them. “He has never been before us,” is a remark they frequently make, and the plain implication is therefore he cannot be much of a lawyer. Judge Ballinger knew that, so he continued: “Furthermore, Miller, you have never had a lawyer before you who was the intellectual superior of Louis T. Wigfall, nor one better prepared to present an able argument upon any question of law.” Judge Miller seemed much surprised at the statement, and I must confess it gave me a new conception of Mr. Wigfall, whom I had never known, and never saw but once, and that was a very Short time before his death in Galveston. One incident in the career of Judge Miller presented a striking illustration of the irony of fate.

Various monomers as used herein are either commercially available or canbe readily prepared following the procedures as described in theco-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/253,980, filed Sep. 1,2016.
The following Examples demonstrate that the compositions of thisinvention are quite stable at 35° C. for several days and can veryreadily be mass polymerized by exposing to a suitable radiation asspecified below.
Example 1 Mass Polymerization of PENB

In a glass bottle, Ru—I (0.0046 g, 0.005 mmol) and CPTX (0.0030 g 0.01mmol) were dissolved in PENB (10 g, 50.42 mmol) without solvent to forma clear solution, the monomer to catalyst ratio was at 10,000:1. Thesolution was UV light exposed (LED 5 W, 395 nm, 3 minutes). The solutionturned to a solid indicating the monomer was fully polymerized, asconfirmed by both DSC and TGA. The unexposed solution was free flowingeven after 3 days at room temperature. This indicates that during the UVexposure CPTX releases a chloride ion that activates Ru—I catalyst.

Article: enclosure. The distinct reason given is the benefit derived from the god through the many strangers who now visit the place.! If Dr. Lolling has rightly fixed the date of this interesting document as the first century B.c.,” it is, however, but a partial corroboration ; and I hesitate to adopt so strange a fact about religion generally from a solitary passage in a treatise, which is throughout an afologia for the decay of faith. Plutarch indeed takes personal credit for having restored and beautified Pylza (the suburb of Delphi where the Pythian games were held), with the help of two friends and of the governor of Delphi—probably a great aid to his own popularity, but indicating no general revival of belief in oracles throughout the Greek world. Gradually the great shrine had gone down in estimation; the priests had no longer the position and wide knowledge of their predecessors ; the Pythia was a common peasant, who talked in vulgar prose ; the subjects of inquiry were domestic and trivial, only fit, he says, to be answered in common language—Am I to marry, to sail, to invest money, or in the case of cities, ques- tions about their crops, their cattle, and their sanitation ?? And yet for all these changes Plutarch ingeniously finds natural causes, which should content men with this decad- ence, just as he exhorts them to acquiesce in their political decay. And here I note as remarkable that the development of religion in Greece brought down the conception of provi- dential interference to the trivial affairs of everyday life, whereas our modern tendency is exactly the reverse. We now hesitate even to pray for rain or fair weather, as our fathers did, but, as it were, restrict the domain of Provi- dence to grave moral matters. 1 MDI vii. 71 sq. 2 This is his correction in the second article (cf. Ζῤζω, vii. 340). 3 De Pyth. 28, XIII PLUTARCH’S PROVINCIALISM 3 tN ~ There is much that is reasonable, much that is eloquent, in the treatise ; and yet what is more singular, what more melancholy, than to see the sage clinging to the sinking ship, or rather trying to stop the leak and declare her sea- worthy, while in his own country, as well as through the Hellenistic East, there had lately been preached a new faith which he never took pains to understand. He can tell us how the Jewish high-priest was clothed, but as to even Jewish dogmas he manifests the grossest ignorance.!_ His collection of the A/acita of philosophers is superficial and jejune ; his studies in comparative religion, though his theory asserted the equal dignity and veracity of all religions, are even more superficial and careless. He professed himself a cosmopoli- tan thinker; he was really a narrow and bigoted Hellene ; as narrow and exclusive as the old opponents of Alex- ander had been in their day. This ingrained bigotry was the real secret of the decay and downfall of Greece. While the Asiatic cities had learned at least something from contact with the East, Greece had remained behind, had become poor and depopulated, stagnant in thought as well as in active life. There is no more signal instance of this stagnation than the sayings and counsels of Plutarch on politics and on religion. The same may be said of his utterances on art. No new production of any merit is mentioned; old statues, old temples, old pictures were still prized. People went to be shown round Delphi by chattering cicerones; they fre- quented picture galleries; they admired the bloom on ancient bronzes,” the splendour of Homer or Pindar, the 1 Cf.

ΧΠῚ music of the ancients, which was no longer understood. On these things Plutarch copies Plato or Aristoxenus. But though statues were set up in crowds to benefactors of their several cities, we hear that these monuments of liberality were kept in stock, often without the heads, which were added when the dedication was ascertained and the statue bought ; and even this was more tolerable than the practice above mentioned (p. 239) of erasing old dedications and renaming the effigies of ancient gods and heroes. Let us then turn to the only life still remaining—the private and domestic doings of Plutarch’s friends. than that of Plutarch’s on the Pythian Oracle. A party of visitors are being led round by the professional showmen, whom they ridicule while they follow them, interrupting their follies with serious talk on religion and art. As usual in Greek literature, the splendid natural features of the place are never mentioned. The openings of the first seventeen chapters contain interesting allusions to old treasure houses and the offerings they contained. The habit of visiting picture galleries is clearly implied by the opening sentence of the tract ov the Gendus of Socrates. An artist compares the visits of ignorant visitors to his gallery (οἱ θεώμενοι τοὺς γεγραμμένους πίνακας) to the confused applause of a crowd, those of the cultivated and critical to acquaintances who individually address him. CHAPTER XIV PLUTARCH AND HIS TIMES—PRIVATE LIFE No generation of men ever felt more keenly than Plutarch’s contemporaries that they represented the old age of their country. Not only is there no outlook before them, but when discussing the treatment and education of the child, we find Plutarch dealing with the various efforts to over- come the constitutional delicacies derived from unhealthy parents, a difficulty which earlier theorists would have met with far more trenchant remedies. Exposing of children was still perhaps as common as of old, but now they were exposed from poverty,! while Plutarch’s wealthy friends, however unfit to be parents, never reflected upon the sin of spreading her- editary disease among their race. There were even medical courses of treatment, intended to protect children from the probable outbreak of such diseases. Plutarch uses all this as an illustration of his principle that the apparent delays of divine justice are only larger and deeper justice, and considers that the ‘skipping of generations’ so often notice- able in gout and other punitive diseases arises from the insight of the Deity into the virtues of those that are spared.? 1 οἱ μὲν yap πένητες οὐ τρέφουσι τέκνὰ κ.τ.λΔ. (de amore prolts, sub. fin. ) 2 De sera num, vind, 19-22. De lb, educ. 3.—If this tract be 324 GREEK WORLD UNDER ROMAN SWAY CHAP. In considering the treatment of children he sets himself strongly against that selfish luxury in parents which causes them to neglect personal supervision. There may be, indeed, excessive and injurious forcing of children,—a very modern vice in parents—but this is not so usual as its opposite.t Beginning with the duty of the mother to nurse her own child—which, by the way, his own wife did not perform—he inveighs against the crime of economising by the selection of cheap or broken-down slaves to look after the children,’ still more against the crime of allow- ing private interest or the thoughtless recommendation of friends to influence the parents’ choice of teachers.? He seems to feel all through—in this perhaps reflecting the in- fluence of Roman habits on Greek fashion—that education is no longer a state affair, but the private duty of parents. There is hardly a word, in his instructions, upon schools and schooling. But he alludes casually to the strange scenes which boys were allowed to witness—criminals dressed up with robes and crowns, and presently stripped and publicly tortured; paintings of subjects so objectionable that we should carefully explain to the child the distinction between art as such and art as a vehicle of morals. On the other hand deportment was strictly watched: for example, not to use the left hand‘ unless it were to hold bread at dinner, while other food was taken with the right; to walk in the genuine, he knows that drunken parents produce drunkards. In Philo (Leg. ad Caium, § 8) there is a remarkable argument put in Caligula’s mouth that his ancestors were his educators in imperial qualities, in that they transmitted his training to him in his blood. 4 Oe, Gite 15. 2 Ifa nurse be employed, let her be a Greek with a good accent (of. cit. 5); on the quality of the pedagogue slave, cap. 7. 3 On false shame, 8. 4 Cf. on the impoliteness of using the left hand, de Trang. 5; Theo- dorus’s remark, de Fortuna, 5; Virt. docert posse, 3. XIV PLUTARCH ON EDUCATION 325 streets without looking up; to touch salt-fish with one finger, fresh-fish, bread, meat, with two ; 20 scratch yourself thus ; to fold your cloak thus.!_ Not only is the necessity of early education insisted upon, but even of a library of standard books for the boy to know and enjoy; and Plut- arch also expresses the old Greek contempt for the man of late or of self-education. If in our day science, which can be learned in mature life, were not taken into account, we should probably hold very similar views, for literary culture is not thus attainable.” If you complain that all this instruction costs more time and money than the poor can afford, Plutarch admits it, but says he is only concerned with the more refined classes. ‘But some one may object that I, undertaking to give pre- scriptions on the training of the children of free citizens, apparently neglect the training of poor townsmen, and only think of instructing the rich—to which the obvious answer is: that I should desire the training I prescribe to be attainable alike by all; but if any, through want of private means, cannot obtain it, let them blame their fortune and not their adviser. Every effort, then, must be made, even by the poor, to train their children in the best possible way, and if this is beyond them, to do it according to their means.’ * This remark is more particularly applicable to bodily training, on which the age had attained to far greater wisdom and more modern common sense than we should have ex- pected. In the first place Plutarch sets himself against any iron rules, which make a man the slave of his body, and purchase health at the cost of accepting idleness and 1 Op. cit. 9. 2 Cf. Symp. ix. qu. 14, ὃ 3, where ὀψιμαθές and ἄγροικον are coupled together. 3 De lib. educ. 11; cf. also de san. prec. 25. 326 GREEK WORLD UNDER ROMAN SWAY CHAP: stupidity along with it. Thus the rule of the trainers that men should not excite themselves with talk at meals he rejects as probably wrong, and in any case socially inex- pedient. Even special diet is bad, and so are all extremes, such as the ostentation! of taking cold baths. Whatever is not natural he regards as unhealthy ; and not only does he speak with the greatest disgust and contempt of the habit of taking emetics, but he puts purgatives in the same cate- gory, as being quite superfluous to those who live a regular and temperate life, and as being only invented to relieve excess.” Still he is human enough to admit, in the mouth of his leading character in the dialogue, that it is not easy to maintain strict moderation at a large and sumptuous feast, where refusing many things is perhaps not polite. ‘You should prepare for such occasions by abstemiousness beforehand. But if you be really indisposed, it is a case of false shame to accept such invitations, when a properly worded excuse wth a smart point in it will often please as much as an acceptance. <A similar defence of your ab- stemiousness at table will often help you easily out of the difficulty.’ Like all later Greek authorities he prefers field sports and general military training to athletic competitions. There is little to be gleaned, as I have said before, con- cerning school life; the later education of the youth now consisted chiefly in hearing lectures and practising rhetoric or disputation, as an introduction either to practical life or that higher calling known as philosophy. He seems to attach but little importance to those efebic institutions, which played so prominent a part in the Hellenistic days of Athens.’ Plutarch is very emphatic on the proper mental ᾿ ἐπιδεικτικὸν καὶ veavixdy, san. prec. 15. * μιαρὰ παραμύθια πλησμονῆς (the loathsome solace of surfeiting), o/. cit, 20. * Inscriptions indeed of such bodies still abound, and we have from XIV THE CLERGY OF THE DAY 327 attitude for the youthful hearers of lectures, readers of poets, and students of art, both as regards the matter brought before them and the person of the teacher. Great care must be taken to separate the mere art side in dramatic poetry and in painting from the ethical. If they see re- presentations of violent or indecent passion they must only attend to the talent of the drawing. And as regards the quality of the teachers, the mere exhibiting sophist is very different from the solid philosopher, who probes our faults, and gives us serious and stern advice ; ‘and you must not be like the many who delight in and applaud him so long as he talks of things indifferent ; but whenever he comes to home questions and takes men to task individually, they get angry and think him intrusive ; for they naturally assume that hear- ing philosophers in the schools is much the same as hearing actors in the theatre, people who differ in nowise from themselves in their private lives. Now this is true enough as regards the sophists, who, when they leave their profes- sional chair and lay aside their books, are in the real affairs of life insignificant and on a level with the many. But as regards real philosophers, men ignore that both their earnest and their sport, their smile and their frown, and most of all their advice to each man in private, bear precious fruit to those who will accustom themselves to attend to them.’! Thus we find ourselves in the presence of what may be called a parochial clergy disseminated through all the towns, the opening of the second century (111, 130 A.D., etc.) onward a most interesting series of the busts of the Athenian coset, or controllers of the efhebz. The great contrasts in the appearance, and the often non- Hellenic types, of these men, who were at least socially of the highest class, are a plain indication how cosmopolitan even Attic society, with all its conservative tendencies, had now become (cf. the busts reproduced by A. Dumont in CZ i. and ii., with his article, i. 229). 1 De rect. rat. aud. 12. 328 GREEK WORLD UNDER ROMAN SWAY CHAP. who consoled people in grief, who received confessions and gave advice in private, and preached their gospel in public. Nor does Plutarch, nor did his age, confine themselves to hearing one philosophic creed. Whether Cynics, or Stoics, or Academicians, or, what was most frequent, Eclectics—all taught serious moral lessons and the acknowledged virtues with no greater differences or contentions than, for example, the various sects of Protestants exhibit in America; dis- puting often, and sometimes angrily, on special points of doctrine, but still agreeing on the broad general lines, and supported in turn by serious men as all knowing and teach- ing practical truths. Plutarch himself derides the paradoxes of the Stoics, and indeed his compromising temper was constitutionally opposed to their trenchant dogmas, but how many points does he not adopt from them? His pro- fessed master, and head of the original Academy, was Plato, and yet all Plutarch’s tracts on married life show that the Platonic “epfublic must have appeared to him not only im- practicable but positively inhuman. He desires no heroic remedies; he expects no great reform in society, but preaches personal dignity as the basis of truthfulness, purity, charity, such as they were understood in the heathen world. I put it in this way because there is a naturalistic vein in him foreign to the heights of Stoic or Christian mor- ality. If a husband lapses from his fidelity let him do it else- where than at home; if the wife hears of it let her ignore it; if she feels repelled from or by her parents-in-law let her cultivate them with peculiar affection; let her educate herself even so far as to study geometry and Plato, but on no account allow religious cults foreign to her husband to creep into the house.'' He censures the cruelties of a hot- 1 This is probably pointed at Christianity, as well as at those oriental cults which we know to have done domestic mischief in those days. XIV THE CRIME OF EXTRAVAGANCE 329 tempered house-master, the miseries of a superstitious one —all the petty weaknesses and vices that attack every over- ripe and decaying society are pictured in his pages. But what remedies does he propose? Not the revelation of any mystery, not the ardent love of a new creed, not the uncompromising courage of a Stoic principle. He borrows from the prosaic Aristotle the doctrine of habit, of gradual progress in virtue, of gradual falling away into vice, and exhorts his hearers to watch small things, to begin with small resolves, to practise ‘active habits of virtue,’ and so train themselves gradually to self-control, good temper, liberality, calmness of mind. ‘There is not even any trench- ant denunciation of the grave immoralities which permeated Greek society. He inveighs indeed against the new and extravagant terms of praise uttered by the audiences in lecture rooms, because here there is excess.! He can- not endure the poet Aristophanes, for in the first place, he says: ‘If you recite him at a feast, each guest must have a grammarian beside him to explain the allusions, and then how coarse he is, and obscene, and how little he studies the proper diction of his various characters.’ But on the splen- dours of the poet—his unequalled richness of humour, his exquisite diction, his lyric sweetness,—not a word. Every eulogy is reserved for Menander, the only poet (beside Euripides) worth reciting in society, the most perfect outcome of Greek literature, the most perfect mirror of human life? Let the reader turn to my Greek Life and 1 De rect. rat. aud. 15.—‘ Those who have brought in the fashion of new exclamations at lectures, such as Devine, Inspired, Unapproach- able (θείως, θεοφορήτως, ἀπροσίτως), instead of the old καλῶς, σοφῶς, or ἀληθῶς, behave with great indecency, and damage the lecturer by sug- gesting that he desires such extravagant eulogy.’ * Even Euripides and Pindar he charges with the vulgarities of boast- fulness and conceit (07 Self Praise, § 1). 330 GREEK WORLD UNDER ROMAN SWAY CHAP. Thought, where I have weighed the Attic New Comedy in the scale of morals. He will be persuaded that a more mesquin and frivolous society has never been brought upon the stage. But Menander and his society were polished ; there was nothing raw or harsh about them; their vices were venilal, or at least curable; they went through their lives without any offensive tragedy or any vulgar suicide. This, then, is really Plutarch’s mission—apart from his work as a biographer—to feel the pulse of society, to give ordinary rules and advices, to make human intercourse smoother and more agreeable. Here it is that all those qualities which make his philosophy superficial and his morals feeble aid him to direct social life with tact and give entertainments with refinement. ‘This is, therefore, a topic worthy of special attention ; for here, if anywhere, the Greeks were still acknowledged masters, and gave the tone to all the society of the civilised world. Indeed we may pass almost naturally from the philosophic lectures, which we have just mentioned, to the question of conversation, for the whole tract ox Proper Conduct at Lectures is partly moral, partly social in its tone. All through it he feels that the danger of his age was over-attention to words, to form, to purity and grace of diction, and neglect of the real substance. ‘Wherefore we should imitate not the flower- girl, but the bee, in seeking for the essence. For the former gathers rich and scented flowers, and weaves them into garlands sweet indeed, but ephemeral and fruitless ; whereas the bee, after flying through meadows of violas and roses and hyacinths, lights upon the strongest and most pungent thyme, and hence obtains what is best for its honey.’ The showy flowers of the field are therefore the food of drones, just as the phrases and periods of the sophist satisfy vulgar 1° Pps 115-123; XIV CRITICISM CRITICISED 331 hearers. ‘Nay, rather as a man about to leave the barber’s shop stands up before the looking-glass, and feels his head, and notes the change in the cut of his hair and beard,’ so he that stands up to leave a lecture-room should examine his mind and see what he has gained.! Nevertheless, fovm is a delightful thing, and young men are quite right to admire it. But remember that nothing is worse than that critical attitude, which cannot praise without some carping or. detraction; here you must ob- serve the mean”? between the gushing and the sneering hearer. But the admiration of form should come after the serious matters, ‘just as those at a feast, when their thirst is allayed, then begin to look at the plate and turn the cups in their hands, so when the hearer is well fed with dogmas, he may consider what elegance there is in the exposi- tion. But he that from the outset does not hold to the substance, but requires the diction to be Attic and chaste,® IW OP Gils 8. = (Of ΕΖ 12: 3 Cf. also de pfrofect. 8: It is remarkable that he ridicules (de wt. pud. 16) as pedantic the avoidance of ἀζαζης in composition, a law carefully attended to by most Attic writers, azd indeed apparently by himself. Iwill here say a word upon this test, so generally accepted, since the famous tract of Benseler, by critics of the Plutarchean collec- tion. Volkmann, in the second or critical part of his exhaustive work (Leben, Schriften und Philosophie des Plutarch, Berlin, 1869), en- deavours to show that in nearly every case internal reasons support this external test. Whenever in a tract of the J/ora/za hiatus is admitted, he finds other reasons to prove its spuriousness. But here, as else- where, the reader will find strongly subjective convictions taking the place of arguments. Thus the Cozsolatio ad Afpollonium is judged by critics so great as Wyttenbach and Bahr to be excellent, an echo of Plato, lofty in diction to the limits of tragedy (of. ct. i. 130); by Volkmann (of. cet. 144) frigid and strained, overladen with false ornament, etc. One cannot but feel that he was led by the new test of Benseler, and that had the Covso/ation avoided hiatus it would have also escaped his censure. And what shall we say of the cases which are doubtful? Thus the tract de Garvrulitate in general avoids hiatus, but has nevertheless so 332 GREEK WORLD UNDER ROMAN SWAY CHAP. is like the man who will not drink an antidote unless it be handed him in Attic ware, or put on a cloak in winter unless the wool be of Attic sheep, but sits idle in his thin and unsubstantial vesture of Lysian language.’ The curious feature in all this is that the imitators were as unable to reproduce Attic purity as our Renaissance builders to reproduce Attic architecture. These later sophists and their hearers had so completely lost the secret that, with the qualified exception of Lucian, who passed muster till he fell into the hands of Cobet, none of them even approximated to Attic purity. They were as degenerate in eloquence as were their contemporaries who affected to copy the old philosophic masters by adopting ‘the lisp of Aristotle and the stoop of Plato.’* To repeat the fine illustration with which he closes the tract: ‘As if one went to seek fire from his neighbour, and finding it bright and cheery were to ‘sit down there and stay warming himself, so is he who comes to seek instruction from another and forgets to kindle his own flame, but in delight at what he hears sits soothed many grave admissions of it as to make Benseler pause. But Volkmann gets rid of some of them by emendation, apologises for the rest, and accepts the tract. The whole discussion, therefore, in his book, though acute and sug- gestive, seems to me to want finality, especially so long as we do not possess a complete zzdex grecitatis to Plutarch (based on some better text than Reiske’s) and ascertain what variations of vocabulary the tracts contain. I have therefore felt justified in quoting from some of the tracts under suspicion, which seem to me to represent manners and customs of Plutarch’s date, though in general the reader will find my conclusions based upon the recognised and unmistakable works of our author. It seems to me very remarkable that Volkmann has taken no notice of the passage which has suggested this note. 1 On this allusion to the clearness and transparency of the ¢enwe genus of Lysias, cf. my Greek Literature, ii. 152. * De aud poet. 59.---ὥσπερ ol τὴν Ἰ]λάτωνος ἀπομιμούμενοι κυρτότητα, kal τὴν ᾿Αριστοτέλους τραυλότητα, a phrase he repeats elsewhere. XIV DUTIES OF AN AUDIENCE 333 with the ruddiness and reflected glow upon his face, and brings home no flame to dissipate the inner darkness and mildew of his soul, or to air it with philosophy.’ ἢ Perhaps these things are but splendid commonplaces ; what is not so is the demand of Plutarch, himself a lecturer, for the warm and even undisguised sympathy of his audience. He expects attentive watching of the lecturer, an upright sitting posture, and a countenance beaming with interest in what is said. Such conduct as sprawling on the benches, assuming a negligent attitude, whispering to one’s neighbour, yawning, giggling, is censured as a social crime. ‘ For some think the speaker only has duties and the hearers none; that he must come well prepared and full of thoughts, but that they without any consideration are to sit down as toa feast which they enjoy at the cost of another’s labour. Yet as surely as good company is necessary to the feast, so is a good hearer to the lecture; for barbarisms and solecisms are quite as possible in the audience as in the speaker.’ ? But if Plutarch makes these demands upon the audience at a discourse, he is even more exacting when he discusses society proper and social entertainments. Then as now, dinner-parties at which ladies were sometimes present, and wine parties of men, were the prevalent occasions for such gatherings. It was the habit, he tells us, at Sybaris, to send out invitations with a year’s notice, in order that the ladies might have time to prepare a splendid toilette.’ As far as the internal preparation of the guests is concerned a year is no notice; it is the whole education of the man which comes out in his social intercourse. ‘For the guest does 1 OP. czt. sub. fin. POE trie tay, irl 3 They are not yet quite so extravagant in London, though I have often seen an invitation to dine six weeks later in that city. 334 GREEK WORLD UNDER ROMAN SWAY CHAP. not go in like a vessel to be filled, but with a mind to give and take in earnest and in jest, for which this is the proper opportunity. And be it remembered that it is easy to decline a dish if it be ill-cooked, or take to water if the wine be bad, but a ¢able-mate who gives you a headache or makes you ill destroys all the pleasure of wines or dainties or music, nor can you send away from the table this source of disgust, which often produces lifelong dislikes, as it were the after-taste* of the unpleasantnesses which occurred at table. Hence Chilon, invited yesterday, was quite right in saying that he would not come till he heard who were to be the company ; in war or on sea voyages you must submit to an unpleasant comrade ; to do so in society is folly.’ ὃ The host, having taken precautions concerning this matter, which indeed was not so easy as it now is, seeing that guests often brought friends with them who were strangers to him, is next bound to see that there is ample room for all, the crowding of a table in any sense being quite inexcusable. Large dinner-parties of twenty-five or thirty were hardly ever successful, as the conversation, which ought to be general, then breaks up into private dialogues ;* and as the dining-rooms of Greek houses were comparatively small, such feasts generally implied very tight fitting of the guests, which Plutarch condemns. ‘Should by any accident the food or the wine run short it is easy to say I am very sorry, but the servants have made away with it, whereas such a polite excuse (!) is impossible in the case of room, over which the master has absolute control.’ He introduces his eighth query in the eighth book of his Zadb/e-talk, by say- 1 Tt is a scandalous thing that the English language has no proper word for σύν δειπνος, conveve. ” FTot-coppers, the German Aatzenjammer, would be even more literal for ἑωλοκρασία, as used in this connection. 3 Sept.

I may add that at the select party given by the former a schoolmaster (γραμματικός) and a cicerone (περιηγητής) figure as guests—certainly not an aristocratic pair in any modern or in a Roman sense; indeed Plutarch introduces the self-conscious vanity of the former as part of the scene ;? the man was silent and sulky because he had not gained applause in a public display. Physicians play a leading part in Plutarch’s society, and evidently enjoyed a good social position now as heretofore in Greece.’ But the whole society at Ammonius’s house is distinctly 270- Jessional—rhetoricians, gymnastic trainers, farmers; not a single grandee or person living idly from his estates can be found among them. The few Romans, like Sossius Senecio, who actually take part in the discussions, may perhaps count as exceptions. Simple appointments and a short mene are commended,! as the whole feast turns upon the mental qualities of the company. But we may note that the absence of an old and wealthy aristocracy with splendid heirlooms in plate and pictures, with princely residences of long tradition, ix, I. 2 Symp. ix. 5. 3. Cf. Hertzberg’s learned note, ii. 174, 175. 4 His notions of wicked luxury are curiously subjective—snow for cooling drinks, the straining of wine, the use of wether mutton and ox- beef (instead of rams and bulls), the making fowl tender by artificial pro- cesses, the fattening of geese for their livers, and many other of the ordinary devices of civilisation are censured (Sy. lib. vi. passzm). Nevertheless the art of cooking, even in Greece, had reached an advanced stage (cf. lib. iv. qu. 1, § 2). 336 GREEK WORLD UNDER ROMAN SWAY CHAP. makes Plutarch underrate the external setting of a dinner- party. The only splendour in display which he knows is that of the zouveau riche, the vulgar upstart, the imitator of the state of Hellenistic courts. This absence of an aris- tocracy, with recognised titles and precedence in society, seems to have also increased the difficulty of placing the guests at table, for the jealousies of human nature, which are universal, were not tempered, as they are with us, by grades of dignity universally recognised. Plutarch insists in many places on the truly democratic nature of social con- verse, where all should affect, if they do not feel, equality. He even regards it as ‘oligarchical and offensive’ to come late ; ‘democratical and polite’ to be in good time.! But the proper placing of the guests seems to him a task in strategy, no less than to manceuvre a phalanx. He even illustrates: it, not without an apology, by the instance of the Divine architect ordering the world from chaos, not adding or destroying one particle of matter, but merely putting each element in its right place. The discussion which follows? is as instructive to-day as it was in the first century. If you make distinctions and fix places you are sure to cause offence. If you let things take their course you will have a random result, in which wrong people are sure to get together, and fail to enjoy themselves, Plutarch’s general solution is to abandon ceremony as to rank, to hold to the democratic aspect of the feast, but to take great care about having suitable people to sit together. And this is not easy, seeing that likeness of character is sometimes a cause of conflict, as with game- cocks, sometimes a cause of friendly consorting, as with jack- daws. ‘There are some that drink too much wine, and some water-drinkers ;? some old men with their conceit, some 1 Symp. viii. 6, ὃ 2. 2 ΤΟΊ Got, 2 3 [bid. vi. qu. 4. XIV PLACING THE COMPANY 337 young with their folly. ‘I advise then not to set the rich by the rich, or the young by the young, or the magistrate beside his colleague, or two intimates together; for so the conversation will have no general activity ; but rather the eager learner beside the distinguished scholar, the be- nign beside the peevish, the ingenuous youth beside the vain old talker, the reserved beside the boaster, the silent beside the passionate; and if you have a lavish richard, draw from the obscure corner some worthy poor man, on the chance of the full cup overflowing into his empty vessel. But don’t put a sophist beside a sophist, or a poet beside a poet ; separate also the captious and the litigious, insert- ing some sort of buffer between them. Whereas I should bring together athletic people and sportsmen and farmers, so also those fond of drinking and the amorous, not merely those who have fallen in love, but those given to wine and women; for men warmed at the same fire more readily consort, provided, by Jove, that they are not in pursuit of the same person.’ He recognises, moreover, what we call grouting ata party. All the company need not be brilliant ; for as we mix water with wine to temper its strength, and as consonants are necessary between the sonants (vowels), so are silent but well-disposed listeners.! The established custom that ladies should sit by their husbands and boys beside their parents solved that side of the difficulty. He proceeds to discuss whether the old fashion, then exploded, of having a regular sympostarch, a master of the feast, was of advantage or not. ‘There was much to be said on both sides, but here again it seems to me that Hellenistic society required more controlling than ours, seeing that dis- play of gifts and forwardness were certainly more common than they are with us northerners. This we may infer L Symp. 1. 1, § 3. Ζ 338 GREEK WORLD UNDER ROMAN SWAY CHAP: from a passage! in which he apprehends that without re- gulation the symposcum will become in turn a democratic assembly, a sophist’s school, a gambling-house, or a scenic stage—such was the taste for display in oratory, recitation, acting.2 A governor of the feast will have to vary the entertainment, and as they say that a walk along the sea, and a sail along the land are the pleasantest, so he must combine earnest and jest. The ¢adble-talk \eft us by our author gives a large assortment of the topics suitable for agreeable conversa- tion. Any one who examines them will see how easy it is to frame theories, and how hard to satisfy practical requirements in detail. Modern and sensible as are his views, there are few of the questions raised which are not either silly, trivial, or even shocking in their naturalism to modern refinement. Here are some specimens: Why are men more greedy towards the end of autumn? Which came first: a hen or an egg? Why is A the first letter of the alphabet? Why is the tear of a wild boar sweet, while that of a stag is salt?—a charming inquiry!* Whether philosophers should wear garlands at a feast? And yet he thinks it vulgar to talk about a feast one has enjoyed, or a procession, or to tell a dream, or a personal dispute one has had.‘ Nay, he even thinks an account of one’s travels rather dull and second-rate.° 1 Symp. i. qu. 4, § 3. 2 The habit of recitations in Greek had lately (he says) come into fashion at Rome, in his own day, and he discusses (γε. vil. qu. 8) what authors are fit for this purpose. He protests against Plato’s dialogues being paraded at a dinner table, but says elsewhere (zdzd. qu. 5, § 4) that Euripides, Pindar, and Menander, especially the last, are more suitable. 3 T can but refer to ill. 6, περὶ καιροῦ συνουσίας. 4 De rect. vat. aud. 3. > Nevertheless the two travellers whom he introduces at the opening XIV THE ART OF CONVERSATION 339 Perhaps the best of all his advices is that on the proper questions to ask so that the guests may display their know- ledge, and have the pleasure of doing so; and again, what exact place jokes and sarcasms should have in a conversa- tion; when they will amuse without doing damage, and when they will ruffle the temper of the ¢ad/e-mates. Here is an abstract of this discussion,! which is too long for quotation. I shall weave in many other parallel pass- ages. He opens his eighth book by saying that to expel philo- sophy from feasts is worse than putting out the light, for when ignorance and bad manners prevail not even the famous golden lamp of the Parthenon would make the gathering decent and orderly. To meet merely for the purpose of eating in silence, if it were possible, is swinish, whereas to take no care about the order and usefulness of the discourse is to serve up the victuals and the wine raw and unprepared, so that the best materials are disgusting. This reverts to the old and universal Greek principle that art has little to do with spontaneity, but is in every phase the result of careful training.* For example, it is very im- portant to put such questions as may induce good temper and ready converse in the guests. Obviously people like to be asked what they think the rest of the company do not know, and what they themselves wish to make known. Thus those who have travelled widely by land and sea like of the tract on the Decay of the Oracles are among the most interesting figures he draws. 1 Symp. ii. 1. * Cf. his tract de Fortuna, where he mentions (8 4) the famous story of the painter producing the bloody froth on the war-horse’s mouth as the only known case where chance gave a new resource to art.

And more generally, whatever we are anxious to talk about without any pressure, we like to be asked to tell, thinking we are conferring a favour in doing what we can hardly be restrained from doing even when it is a bore. This is a peculiar weakness in mariners; whereas refined people like to be asked what they want to tell, but are ashamed to volunteer, from regard to their company ; as, for example, their own successes and achievements—such as in embassies and politics.” Accordingly, jealous and ill- natured people avoid such questions, and turn off the con- versation so as to keep it from leading up naturally to such subjects, and rather take up what a man’s adversaries would like to hear. Avoid therefore allusions to misfortunes, such as the loss of a suit at law, the death of a child, or mis- fortunes in trade by sea and land. Here, on the contrary, are agreeable topics. Men delight in being repeatedly questioned about their success in a harangue, or how they were addressed by the king, or how they escaped storms or pirates, while their fellows were caught; for they seem to enjoy the thing all over again in telling it. ‘They like also to be asked about their children’s progress in learning, and about their own inter- course or intimacy with princes.

At no time did the Greeks generally appreciate what he justly calls τὸ σεμνὸν καὶ τὸ ἅγιον Kal τὸ μυστηρίωδες τῆς σιωπῆς. * Further examples of long-winded stories are given, de Garr, 21, 22. XIV THE ART OF CONVERSATION 341 enemies too they delight in telling, when they are asked, but avoid volunteering on this subject, as it seems like spite. So you should ask a sportsman about dogs, an athlete about contests, an amorous man about beauty. But the pious man, who is given to sacrifices, and likes talking of dreams, and how he made a hit by observing omens, or victims, or by the favour of the gods, should be questioned accordingly. Old people too, though they may have nothing to say, are always pleased and set going by questions, while those who curtail their conversation, and want mere categorical answers, take away the chief plea- sure which the old have in society. ‘To sum up: If you desire to be agreeable ask questions for which the answerer will gain not blame, but approval; not dislike, but goodwill from the company. I will add that in another place! he comments on the gross impoliteness of answering a question addressed to another without waiting for his reply. It implies that he does not know, or that you know better, and says to the questioner: Why did you ask another, when I was present; ofttimes too the question was not intended to elicit information, but merely to draw a silent or modest man into the conversation and make him feel athome. All this the chatterbox upsets by his meddlesome forwardness. Many of these points are illustrated from Homer, whose poems were to Plutarch, as to all the literary Greeks of that age, a mine not only of philosophy and religion but of good manners.

I upgraded Kubuntu from 20.04 to 20.10. After this sound often doesn't work when booting my computer, it gets fixed if I restart the X-server with Ctrl+Alt+Backspace.
I tried making a fresh OS install but the issue persists.
Does anyone know what might be the issue? It's rather annoying to have to quit all GUI apps to get sound to work.

I had a similar (same?) problem after upgrading my Kubuntu installation to 20.10. The cause was Pipewire, which got installed in the upgrade.
The solution, for me, was to disable the Pipewire service:
sudo systemctl --global disable pipewire
sudo systemctl reboot

That seemed to do the trick, but I ended up uninstalling the Pipewire binary, too:
sudo apt purge pipewire

P.S. Pipewire seems great in its promise! But I guess it still needs a bit more time to mature and to be properly integrated into the distribution(s).

I too have a similar problem since upgrading to Kubuntu 20.10.  After each reboot, I have to enter audio settings, change the Built-In audio profile to something else, and then back to what was set and it works until the next restart.
I've also tried forcibly creating a new profile, as described below, but that was no help.

Dist., 994 F.2d 160, 166 n. 7 (5th Cir.1993) (eschewing “Lemon analysis in favor of a more case-bound approach” because, although normally " 'it is neither [this court’s] object nor [its] place to opine whether the Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence is good, fair, or useful,' ... recent indications suggest that the Court agrees with [a terminal] assessment of Lemon, essentially ignoring it in Lee in favor of the school prayer cases”) (quoting Jones, 977 F.2d at 966, and citing to Justice Scalia's dissent in Lee); see also Bauchman v. West High School, 132 F.3d 542, 551-52 (10th Cir.1997) ("Justice O'Connor's 'endorse*829ment test’ is now widely accepted as the controlling analytical framework for evaluating Establishment Clause claims.”), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 2370, 141 L.Ed.2d 738 (1998); but see Helms v. Picard, 151 F.3d 347, 362 (5th Cir.1998) ("[T]he Supreme Court has not abandoned, nor even fundamentally changed, the Lemon test.”), amended 165 F.3d 311 (5th Cir.1999).
 Even if the Supreme Court has not yet effectively abandoned the Lemon test, the majority's insistence that schools bar sectarian and proselytizing prayers would surely fail Lemon’s excessive entanglement test. Compare, Ingebretsen v. Jackson Pub. Sch. Dist., 88 F.3d at 279 (to the extent that a statute requires school officials to review the content of prayers to ensure that they meet nonsectarian and nonproselytizing requirements, that statute excessively entangles government with religion); Lee, 505 U.S. at 617, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (Souter, J., concurring) (describing as "undefinable” the point at which a state-approved, ecumenical prayer becomes so closely identified with the sacred text of a specific religion that a breach of the Establishment Clause has occurred); and Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 272 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981) (finding that a university would entangle itself with religion by attempting to exclude "religious speech” because enforcing that exclusion would require officials to distinguish between religious and nonreligious speech); with Clear Creek II, 977 F.2d at 968 (stating that "we know of no authority that holds yearly review of unsolicited material for sectarianism and proselytization to constitute excessive entanglement”).
 . This principle of neutral accommodation is fully consistent with and anticipated by Lee, see id., 505 U.S. at 598-99, 112 S.Ct. 2649 ("We recognize that, at graduation time and throughout the course of the educational process, there will be instances when religious values, religious practices, and religious persons will have some interaction with the public schools and their students.”) (citing Mergens); id. at 630 n. 8, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (Souter, J., joined by Stevens & O’Connor, U., concurring) ("If the State had chosen its graduation day speakers according to wholly secular criteria, and if one of those speakers (not a state actor) had individually chosen to deliver a religious message, it would have been harder to attribute an endorsement to the State.”), and has been both sustained and augmented by the Court's more recent cases. See, e.g., Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 842, 115 S.Ct. 2510 (slating, once again, that "[i]t does not violate the Establishment Clause for a public university to grant access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis to a wide spectrum of student groups, including groups which use meeting rooms for sectarian activities”); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 766, 115 S.Ct. 2440, 132 L.Ed.2d 650 (1995) (plurality) ("Religious expression cannot violate the Establishment Clause where it (1) is purely private and (2) occurs in a traditional or designated public forum, publicly announced and open to all on equal terms.”); Board of Education v.

Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 8, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993) (noting that "government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion are not readily subject to an Establishment Clause challenge,” for, if the reverse were true, "then 'a church could not be protected by the police and fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept in repair’ ”) (quoting Widmar, 454 U.S. at 274-75, 102 S.Ct. 269).
 . On this point, it is important to note that Clear Creek II clearly rests on an interpretation of "invocation” and "benediction” that is itself free of all religious content. Clear Creek II, 977 F.2d at 969. This fact goes some way towards distinguishing the result in Clear Creek II from the contrary decision of the Third Circuit in ACLU v. Black Horse Pike Regional Bd. of Educ., 84 F.3d 1471 (3d Cir.1996) (en banc), where the challenged policy provided for a student-elected, student-given, "invocation and benediction prayer." Id. at 1475 (emphasis added).
. But see Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S. at 392-93, 113 S.Ct. 2141 (suggesting, prior to our decision in Duncanville, that even in a nonpublic forum, the neutral accommodation principle applies).
.The majority cites only one case in support of its rigid view that a graduation ceremony (or portions thereof) could not constitute a public forum. In its citation of, and quotation from, that case the majority takes more liberties than should be allowable. In quoting Brody v. Spang, the majority panhandles a remote district court's musings as Third Circuit law without proper attribution. The quotation reads,
Graduation ceremonies have never served as forums for public debate or discussions, or as a forum through which to allow varying groups to voice their views.
 Ante at 819 (quoting Brody v. Spang, 957 F.2d 1108, 1119-20 (3d Cir.1992) (quoting Lundberg v. West Monona Community Sch. Dist., 731 F.Supp. 331 (N.D.Iowa 1989))). But the Brody court did not indicate any agreement in quoting the Iowa district court. In fact, the Brody court followed its discussion of Lundberg with the following statement:
Nonetheless, it is certainly possible that the commencement exercises at Downingtown Senior High School could qualify as a public forum, and nothing in the present record demonstrates otherwise. More specifically, although the 'terms of the consent decree [at issue in this case] suggest that the pool of potential graduation speakers is confined to members of the school community and invited guests, this simply indicates that any forum created is a limited one, and does not preclude a finding that the ceremony has been designated as a public forum.
Brody, 957 F.2d at 1120 (citing Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 267, 108 S.Ct. 562, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988)).
. As these citations reveal, the majority applies factors designed for use in analyzing "as-applied” challenges to government restrictions on speech when the plaintiff has brought a facial challenge to a policy not yet implemented.
. See, e.g., Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989) ("[E]ven in a public forum the government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided [that] the restrictions 'are justified without *833reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.' ”) (quoting Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984)).
 . Lamb’s Chapel and Pinette positively suggest that a "nonsectarian, nonproselytizing" content limitation is itself unconstitutional in this setting. See Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S. at 394, 113 S.Ct. 2141 (noting that " 'government violates the First Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espous*834es/” and holding that a requirement of no religious content constitutes such an impermissible viewpoint restriction) (quoting Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439); Pinette, 515 U.S. at 766, 115 S.Ct. 2440 (stating that "giving sectarian religious speech preferential access to a forum ... would violate the ... Free Speech Clause, since it would involve a content limitation,” and thereby implying that the reverse would also be true). Although Clear Creek II clearly held that a "nonsectarian, nonproselytiz-ing” content limitation was constitutionally permissible in the context of a limited public forum, see Clear Creek II, 977 F.2d at 967 & 971, Lamb's Chapel and Pinette are subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court, so it would appear that this holding has been overruled.
 . Although the question is not before us, courts and commentators have criticized the idea that an elected class could qualify either as "religion neutral” or even as a proper class for public forum and Mergens purposes. See, e.g., Doe v. Madison Sch. Dist. No. 321, 147 F.3d 832, 834 n. 7 (9th Cir.1998) (finding selection by grade point a superior method in this regard); Black Horse, 84 F.3d at 1477-78; Recent Case, 110 Harv. L. Rev. 781, 783-84 (1997); Rick A. Swanson, Time for a Change: Analyzing Graduation Invocations and Benedictions under Religiously Neutral Principles of the Public Fomm, 26 U. Mem. L. Rev. 1405, 1422-25, 1432-33 & n. 95 (1996); cf. Widmar, 454 U.S. at 275, 102 S.Ct. 269 (making explicit exception for the situation where "empirical evidence [shows] that religious groups will dominate the forum”); Pinette, 515 U.S. at 766, 115 S.Ct. 2440 (noting that "one can conceive of a[n unconstitutional] case in which the governmental entity manipulates its administration of the public forum in such a manner that only certain religious groups take advantage of it”); Clear Creek II, 977 F.2d at 969 (stating that "[w]e can imagine discriminatory methods of implementing the [policy] that would make it a tool for governmental endorsement of religion”).
. The Football Policy states:
The board has chosen to permit students to deliver a brief invocation and/or message to be delivered during the pre-game ceremonies of ' home varsity football games to solemnize the event, to promote good sportsmanship and student safety, and to establish the appropriate environment for the competition.
 Upon advice and direction of the high school principal, each spring, the high school student council shall conduct an election, by the high school student body, by secret ballot, to determine whether such a statement or invocation will be a part of the pre-game ceremonies and if so, shall elect a student, from a list of student volunteers, to deliver the statement or invocation. The student volunteer who is selected by his or her classmates may decide what message and/or invocation to deliver, consistent with the goals and purposes of this policy.
Like the graduation policy, the Football Policy contains a fallback provision that goes into effect if a court enjoins the enforcement of tire primary policy provisions. If this occurs, the policy goes into effect with the following sentence added to the last paragraph:
Any message and/or invocation delivered by a student must be nonsectarian and nonprosely-tizing.
. The majority also claims to find support in Doe v. Duncanville Indep. Sch. Dist., 70 F.3d 402 (5th Cir.1995), for striking the Football Policy. But Duncanville was an entirely different case, involving private prayers among team members — not "public” prayers or messages in any sense.
. The quote is from the Book of the Prophet Micah, ch. 6, v. 8 ("He has showed you, 0 man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.”).
.Cf. Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 835, 115 S.Ct. 2510 ("The first danger to liberty lies in granting the State the power to examine publications to determine whether or not they are based on some ultimate idea and, if so, for the State to classify them.”).
. The Koran, Al-Furqan 25:63, at 256 (N.J. Dawood trans., Penguin Books 1997).

us to take up the oxidation of ascorbic acid using 
diphenylamine as indicator in the above medium. Potentiometric Titration : 70 ml of glacial acetic acid (12M overall), 10 ml 
of sulphuric acid of 5 M (0.5 M overall) are taken 
in a 150 ml beaker; 1.0 ml of diphenylamine and an 
aliquot of ascorbic acid are added. The total 
volume of the solution is kept at 100 ml at the end 
point. Titration is carried out with potassium 
hexacyanoferrate(III) using bright platinum elec-
trode as the indicator electrode and saturated 
calomel electrode as reference one, and ammonium 
nitrate salt bridge (sintered disc type). Steady 
potentials are obtained during titration within 1 
minute well before and after the end ~int and 
within 3-4 minutes just around the end potnt. The 
results are presented in Table 2. Experimental 0.1 M solution of potassium hexacyanoferrate-

ment of M. R. College, Vizianagaram for kindly 
deputing T.V.R. for the F.I.P. In the visual titration a positive error of 3.05 
±0.1% (with the standard dev:iation. o~ 0.1.5) !s 
observed. However, the potentlometnc titration 1s 
consistent with the standard method. As such the 
potentiometric titration of ascorbic acid in the 
medium recommended along with diphenylamine 
clearly differentiated the potential break at the 
theoretical equivalence point and that obtained 
visually. The titration potential values at the 
theoretical equivalence point and that at the colour 
change of the indicator are 816 mV and 886 mV 
against NHE respectively. The reason may probably 
be attributed to the Eb1rb value of diphenylamine 
being 0.86 vu. requiring further 3% excess of 
potassium 
hexacyanoferrate(III) 
for its being 
oxidized. This, therefore, represents the positive 
error reported in Table 1 and can be construed as 
the indicator error. Diphenyl benzidine, diphenyl-
amine sulfonic acid, n-phenylanthranilic acid are 
found to be unsatisfactory in this medium, whose 
Eblsh values16 are 0.94 V, 0.91 V and 1.0 V respec-
tively. References 1. B. 8. TSYAGARAJAN, Ohem. B61.1iews,1958, 58, 439. 2

Article: I wish I knew the secret." " Come and I will show you," she said, laugh- ing gayly, and she led him away into the wood. Presently he heard the sound of falling water, and his guide brought him triumphantly to a brook gurgling over mossy rocks, at whose foot was a shallow basin. " There is my boudoir," she said. " The secret of beauty is in the bath. I will reconnoiter the neigh- borhood while you try it for yourself." Stewart flung off his clothes, splashed joyously into the cold, clear water, and had perhaps the most delicious bath of his life. There was no soap, to be sure, but much may be done by persistent rubbing; and there were no towels, but the warm wind of the morning made them ahnost unnecessary. He got back into his clothes again with a sense of astonish- 206 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE ing well-being — except for a most persistent gnavr- ing at his stomach. " I wonder where we shall breakfast to-day? " he mused as he laced his shoes. " Nowhere, most prob- ably! Oh, well, if that dear girl can stand it, I oughtn't to complain!" And he fell to thinking of her, of her slim grace, of the curve of her red lips " Confound it ! " he said. " I can't stand it much longer. Friendship is all very well, and the big" brother act may do for a while — but I can't keep it up forever, and what's more, I won't ! " And then he heard her calling, in the clear, high voice he had grown to love. *' All right ! " he shouted. '* Come along ! ' Presently she appeared between the trees, and he watched her with beating heart — so straight, so sup- ple, so perfect in every line. " Did the magic work ? " she inquired, gayly. *' Partly ; but it takes more than water to remove a two-days' growth of beard," and Stewart ran a rueful finger over his stubbly chin. " But can it be only two days since you burst into my room at the Kolner Hof, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me ! " " Please do not speak of it ! '* she pleaded, with THE NIGHT ATTACK 207 crimson cheeks. " It was not an easy thing for a girl to do ; but that spy was watching — ^so I nerved myself, and " "You did it very well, indeed," he said, remi- niscently. " And to think that not once since then " " Once was quite enough." " Oh, I don't blame you ; I know I'm not an at* tractive object. People will be taking us for beauty and the beast." " Neither the one nor the other ! " she corrected. ** Well, I take back the beast ; but not the beauty I You are the loveliest thing I ever saw," he added, huskily. " The very loveliest ! " She looked down at him for an instant, and her eyes were very tender ; then she looked hastily away. " There were to be no compliments until we were out of Germany," she reminded him. " We are out of Germany," he said, and got slowly. to his feet, his eyes on fire. " No, no," she protested, backing hastily away from him. " This is German ground — let me show you ! " and she ran before him out into the meadow. " Look down yonder ! " Looking down, Stewart saw the mighty army yrhich had been mustered to crush France. 20» THE GIRL FROM ALSACE As far as the eye could reach, and from side to side of the broad valley, it stretched — ^masses of men and horses and wagons and artillery — amasses and masses— thousands upon thousands — mile upon tiile. A broad highway ran along either side of the river, and along each road a compact host moved steadily westward toward Liege. Suddenly from the west came the thunder of heavy guns, and Stewart knew that the attack had commenced again. Again men were being driven forward to death, as they would be driven day after day, until the end, whatever that might be. And whatever it was, not a single dead man could be brought to life; not a single maimed man made whole ; not a single dollar of the treasure which was being poured out like a flood could be recovered. It was all lost, wasted, worse than wasted, since it was being used to destroy, not to create! Incredible-^ impossible — ^it could not be! Even with that mighty army beneath his eyes, Stewart told him- self for the hundredth time that it could not be! ^ The voice of his comrade broke in upon his thotjghts. " We must work our way westward along the hills until we come to the Meuse," she said. " This is the THE NIGHT ATTACK 209 yalley of the Vesdre, which flows into the Meuse, so we have only to follow it." " Can't you prevail upon your fairy godmother to provide breakfast first ? " asked Stewart. " Fm sure you have only to wish for it, and the table would appear laden with an iced melon, bacon and eggs, crisp rolls, yellow butter, and a pot of coffee — I think I can smell the coffee ! " He closed his eyes and sniffed. " How perfect it would be to sit right here and eat that breakfast and watch the Germans I Oh, well," he added, as she turned away, " if not here, then somewhere else. Wait! Isn't that a house over yonder ? " It was indeed a tiny house whose gable just showed among the trees, and they made their way cautiously toward it. It stood at the side of a small garden, with two or three outbuildings about it, and it was shielded on one side by an orchard. No smoke rose from the chimney, nor was there any sign of life. And then Stewart, who bad been crouching behind the hedge beside his companion, looking at all this, rose suddenly to his feet and started for- ward. " Come on," he cried; " the Germans haven't been this way — ^there's a chicken," and he pointed to 210 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE where a plump hen was scratching industriously under the hedge. *' Here is another sign," said the girl, as they crossed the garden, and pointed to the ground. " The potatoes and turnips have not been dug." ! " It must be here we're going to have that break- fast ! " cried Stewart, and knocked triumphantly at the door. There was no response and he knocked again. Then he tried the door, biit it was locked. There was another door at the rear of the house, but it also was locked. There were also three windows, but they were all tightly closed with wooden shut- ters. " We've got to have something to eat, that's cer- tain," said Stewart, doggedly. " We shall have to break in," and he looked about for a weapon with which to attack the door. "No, no," protested the girl, quickly. "That would be too like the Uhlans ! Let us see if there is not some other way ! " "What other way can there be?" " Perhaps there is none," she answered ; " and if there is not, we will go on our way, and leave this house undamaged. You too seem to have been poi- soned by this virus of war 1 " THE NIGHT ATTACK 2 1 1 " I only know Fm starving! " said Stewart. " If I've been poisoned by anything, it's by the virus of appetite ! " "If you were ia your own country, and found i yourself hungry, would you break into the first house you came to in order to get food ? " she demanded. " Certainly not — ^you would do without food before you would do that. Is it not so? " " Yes," said Stewart, in a low tone. " That is so. You are right." " Perhaps I can find something," she said, more gently. " At least I will try. Remain here for a moment," and she hurried away toward the out- buildings. Stewart stared out into the road and reflected how easy — ^how inevitable almost — ^it was to become a robber among thieves, a murderer among cut- throats. And he understood how it happens that in war even the kindliest man may become blood- thirsty, even the most honest a looter of dfefenseless homes. " See what I have found I " cried a voice, and he turned to see the girl running toward him with hands outstretched. In each hand she held three eggs. "Very well for a beginning," he commented. 21X THE GIRL FROM ALSACE ** Now for the melon, the bacon, the rolls, the butter, and the coffee ! " " I fear that those must wait," she said. " Here is your breakfast," and she handed him three of the eggs. Stewart looked at tl;iem rather blankly. " Thanks ! " he said. " But I don't quite see '^ " Then watch ! " Sitting down on the doorstep, she cracked one of her eggs gently, picked away the loosened bit of shell at its end, and put the egg to her lips. " Oh ! " he said. " So thafs it ! " and sitting down beside her, he followed her example. He had heard of sucking eggs, but he had never before tried it, and he found it rather difficult and not particularly pleasant. But the first egg undoubt- edly did assuage the pangs of hunger; the second assuaged them still more, and the third quite ex- tinguished them. In fact, he felt a little surfeited. " Now," she said, " for the dessert." " Dessert ! " protested Stewart. " Is there des- sert? Why didn't you tell me? I never heard of dessert for breakfast, and I'm afraid I haven't room for it!" " It will keep ! " she assured him, and leading him around the larger of the outbuildings, she showed THE NIGHT ATTACK 213 him a tree hanging thick with ruddy apples. " There are our supplies for the campaign ! " she announced. " My compliments ! " he said. " You would make a great general.'* I They ate one or two apples and then filled their pockets. From one of hers, the girl drew a pipe and pouch of tobacco. " Would you not like to smoke? " she asked. " I have been told that a pipe is a great comfort in times of stress ! " And Stewart, calling down blessings upon her head, filled up. Never had tobacco tasted so good, never had that old pipe seemed so sweet, as when he blew out the first puff upon the morning air. *' Salvation Yeo was right," he said. " As a hun- gry man's food, a sad man's cordial, a chilly man's fire, there's nothing like it under the canopy of heaven! I only wish you could enjoy it too! " " I can enjoy your enjoyment ! " she laughed as they set happily off together. At the corner of the wood, Stewart turned for a last look at the house. it How glad I am I didn't break in ! " he said. CHAPTER XII AN ARMY IN ACTION The sound of cannonading grew fiercer and fiercer, as they advanced, and the undertone of rifle fire more perceptible. It was evident that the Germans were rapidly getting more and more guns into action, and that the infantry attack was also being hotly pressed. Below them in the valley, they caught glimpses from time to time, as the trees opened out a little, of the gray-clad host marching steadily forward, as though to overwhelm the forts by sheer weight of numbers ; and then, as they came out above a rocky bluff, they saw a new sight — an ear- nest that the Belgians were fighting to some pur- pose. In a level field beside the road a long tent had been pitched, and above it floated the flag of the Red Cross. Toward it, along the road, came slowly a seemingly endless line of motor ambulances. Each of them in turn stopped opposite the tent, and white- clad assistants lifted out the stretchers, each with its AN ARMY IN ACTION 215, huddled occupant, and. carried them quickly, yet very carefully, inside the tent. In a moment the bearers were back again, pushed the empty stretchers into place, and the ambulance turned and sped swiftly back toward the battlefield. Here, too, it was evi- dent that there was admirable and smoothly-working system — a system which alleviated, so far as it was possible to do so, the horror and the suffering of battle. Stewart could close his eyes and see what was going on inside that tent. He could set the stripping away of the clothing, the hasty examination, the sterilization of the wound, and then, if an operation was necessary, the quick preparation, the application of the ether-cone and the swift, unerring flash of the surgeon's knife. " That's where I should be," he said, half to him- self, " I might be of some use there! " And then he turned his eyes eastward along the road. " Great heavens ! Look at that gun." Along the road below them came a monstrous can- non, mounted on a low, broad- wheeled truck, and drawn by a mighty tractor. It was of a girth so huge, of a weight evidently so tremendous, that it seemed impossible it could be handled at all, and yet it rolled along as smoothly as though it were the 2i6 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE merest toy. Above it stretched the heavy crane which would swing it into the air and place it gently on the trunnions of its carriage. Drawn by an- other tractor, the carriage itself came close behind — more huge, more impressive if possible, than the gun itself. Its tremendous wheels were encircled with heavy blocks of steel, linked together and undulating along the road for all the world like a monster cater- pillar; its massive trail seemed forged to withstand the shock of an earthquake. " So that is the surprise ! " murmured the girl be- neath her breath. And she was right. This was the surprise which had been kept so carefully concealed — ^the Krupp contribution to the war — ^the largest field howitzer ever built, hurling a missile so powerful that neither steel nor stone nor armored concrete could stand against it. In awed silence, the two fugitives watched this mighty engine of destruction pass along the road to its appointed task. Behind it came a motor truck carrying its crew, and then a long train of ammuni- tion carts filled with what looked like wicker bas- « kets — ^but within each of those baskets lay a shell weighing a thousand pounds ! And as it passed, the troops, opening to right and left, cheered it wildly, AN ARMY IN ACTION 217 for to them it meant more than victory — it meant that they would, perhaps, be spared the desperate charge with its almost certain death. Scarcely had the first gone by, when a second gun came rolling along the road, followed by its crew and its ammunition-train; and then a third appeared, seemingly more formidable than either of the others. " These Germans are certainly a wonderful peo- ple," said Stewart, following the three monsters with his eyes as they dwindled away westward along the road. " They may be vain and arrogant and self-confident; apparently they haven't much regard for the rights of others. But they are thorough. We must give them credit for that ! They are prepared for everything." " Yes," agreed his companion; " for everything except one thing." ** And that?" '* The spirit of a people who love liberty. Neither cannon nor armies can conquer that ! The German Staff believed that Belgium would stand aside in fear." * '* Surely you don't expect Belgium to win? " *' Oh, no! But every day she holds the German army here is a battle won for Fr^ce. Oh, France 2i8 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE will honor Belgium now ! See — ^the army has been stopped. It is no longer advancing! " What was happening to the westward they could not see, or even guess, but it was true that the hel- meted host had ceased its march, had broken ranks, and was stacking arms and throwing oS its accouter- ments in the fields along the road. The halt was to be for some time, it seemed, for everywhere camp- kitchens were being hauled into place, fires started, food unloaded. " Come on ! come on ! " urged the girl. " We must reach the Meuse before this tide rolls across it." They pressed forward again along the wooded hillside. Twice they had to cross deep valleys which ran back into the mountain, and once they had a narrow escape from a cavalry patrol which came cantering past so close upon their heels that thej had barely time to throw themselves into the under- brush. They could see, too, that even in the hills caution was necessary, for raiding parties had evi- dently struck up into them, as was proved by aiij' occasional column of smoke rising from a burning house. Once they came upon an old peasant with a face wrinkled like a withered apple, sitting staring down at the German host, so preoccupied that he did not even raise his eyes as they passed. And at AN ARMY IN ACTION 219 last they came out above the broad plain where the Vesdre flows into the Meuse. Liege, with its towers and terraced streets, was concealed from them by a bend in the river and by a bold bluff which thrust out toward it from the east — a bluff crowned by a turreted fortress — ^perhaps the same they had seen the night before— which was vomiting flame and iron down into the valley. The trees and bushes which clothed its sides con- cealed the infantry which was doubtless lying there, but in the valley just below them they could see at battery of heavy guns thundering against the Bel- gian fort. So rapidly were they served that the roar of their discharge was almost continuous, while high above it rose the scream of the shells as they hurtled toward their mark. There was something fascinating in the precise, calculated movement of the gunners — one crouching on the trail, one seated on either side of the bfeech, four others passing up the shells from the caisson close at hand. Their officer was watching the effect of the fire through a field-glass, and speaking a word of direction now and then. Their fire was evidently taking effect, for it was this battery which the gunners in the fort were try- ing to silence — ^trying blindly, for the German guns 220 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE were masked by a high hedge and a strip of orchard, and only a tenuous, quickly-vanishing wisp of white smoke marked the discharge. So the Belgian gun- ners dropped their shells hither and yon, hoping that ^chance might send one of them home. They did not find the battery, but they found other marks — ^ beautiful white villa, on the first slope of the hillside, was torn asunder like a house of cards and a moment later was in flames; a squad of cavalry, riding gayly back from a reconnoissance down the river, was violently scattered; a peasant family, father and mother and three children, hasten- ing along the road to a place of safety, was in- stantly blotted out. It was evident now that the Meuse was the barrier which had stopped the army. Far up toward Liege were the ruins of a bridge, and no doubt all the others had been blown up by the Belgians. Down by the river-bank a large force of engineers were working like mad to throw a pontoon across the swift current. The material had already been brought up— heavy, flat-bottomed boats, carried on wagons drawn by motor-tractors, great beams and planks, boxes of bolts — everything, in a word, needed to build this bridge just here at a point whidi had no doubt been selected long in advance! The AN ARMY IN ACTION 221 bridge shot out into the river with a speed which seemed to Stewart almost miraculous. Boat after boat was towed into place and anchored firmly ; great beams were bolted into position, each of them fitting exactly; and then the heavy planks were laid with the precision and rapidity of a machine. Indeed, 'Stewart told himself, it was really a machine that he -was watching — a machine of flesh and blood, won- derfully trained for just such feats as this. " Look ! look ! " cried the girl, and Stewart, fol- lowing her pointing finger, saw an aeroplane sweep- ing toward them from the direction of the city. Evidently the defenders of the fort, weary of firing; blindly at a battery they could not see, were send- ing a scout to uncover it. The aeroplane flew very high at first — ^so high that the two men in it appeared the merest specks, but al- most at once two high-angle guns were banging away at it, though the shells fell far short. Gradu- ally it circled lower and lower, as if quite uncon- scious of the marksmen in the valley, and as it swept past the hill, Stewart glimpsed the men quite plainly —one with his hands upon the levers, the other, with a pair of glasses to his eyes, eagerly scanning the ground beneath. And then Stewart, happening to glance toward the 222 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE horizon, was held enthralled by a new spectacle. High over the hills to the east flew a mammoth shape, straight toward the fort. Its defenders saw their danger instantly, and hastily elevating some of their guns, greeted the Zeppelin with a salvo. But it came straight on with incredible speed, and as it passed above the fort, a terrific explosion shook the mountain to its base. Stewart, staring with bated breath, told himself that that was the end, that not one stone of that great fortress re- mained upon another; but an instant later, another volley sent after the fleeing airship told that the fort still stood — ^that the bomb had missed its mark. The aeroplane scouts, their vision shadowed by the broad wings of their machine, had not seen the Zeppelin until the explosion brought them sharp round toward it. Then, with a sudden upward swoop, they leaped forward in pursuit. But noth- ing could overtake that monster, — ^it was speeding too fast, it was already far away, and in a moment disappeared over the hills to the west. So, after a moment's breathless flight, the biplane turned, circled slowly above the fort, and dropped down toward the town behind it. Five minutes later, a high-powered shell burst squarely in the midst of the German battery. AN ARMY IN ACTION 223 disabling two of the guns. At once the horses were driven up and the remaining guns whirled away to a new emplacement, while a passing motor ambulance was stopped to pick up the wounded. Stewart, who had been watching all this with something of the feelings of a spectator at some tremendous panorama, was suddenly conscious of a mighty stream of men approaching the river from the head of the valley. A regiment of cavalry rode in front, their long lances giving them an appearance indescribably picturesque ; behind them came column after column of infantry, moving like clock-work, their gray uniforms blending so perfectly with the background that it was difficult to tell where the columns began or where they ended. Their pas- sage reminded Stewart of the quiver of heat above a sultry landscape — sl vibration of the air scarcely per- ceptible. All the columns were converging on the river, and looking toward it, Stewart saw that the bridge was almost done. As the last planks were laid, a squad- ron of Uhlans, which had been held in readiness, dashed across, and deploying fanshape, advanced to reconnoiter the country on the other side. *' That looks like invasion in earnest 1 " said Stewart. ^24 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE • The girl nodded without replying, her eyes on the advancing columns. The cavalry was the first to reach the bridge, and filed rapidly across to reen force their comrades; then the infantry pressed forward in solid column. Stewart could see how the boats settled deep in the water under the tremendous weight. High above all other sounds, came the hideous shriek of a great shell, which flew over the bridge and exploded in the water a hundred yards below it. A minute later, there came another shriek, but this time the shell fell slightly short. But the third shell — ^the third shell ! Surely, Stewart told himself, the bridge will be •cleared; that close-packed column will not be ex- posed to a risk so awful. But it pressed on, with- out a pause, without a break. What must be the soldiers' thoughts, as they waited for the third shell ! Again that high, hideous, blood-curdling shriek split through the air, and the next instant a shell exploded squarely in the middle of the bridge. Stewart had a moment's vision of a tangle of shat- tered bodies, then he saw that the bridge was gone and the river filled with drowning men, weighed down by their heavy accouterments. He could hear AN ARMY IN ACTION 225 their shrill cries of terror as they struggled in the current ; then the cries ceased as the river swept most of them away. Only a very few managed to reach the bank. Stewart hid his face in his trembling hands. It was too hideous! It could not be! He could not bear it — ^the world would not bear it, if it knew ! A sharp cry from his companion told him that the awful drama was not yet played to an end. She was pointing beyond the river, where the cavalry and the small body of infantry which had got across seemed thrown into sudden confusion. Horses reared and fell, men dropped from their saddles. The in- fantry threw themselves forward upon their faces; and then to Stewart's ears came the sharp rattle of musketry. "The Belgians are attacking them!" cried the girl. " They are driving them back ! " But that cavalry, so superbly trained, that infan- try, so expertly officered, were not to be driven back without a struggle. The Uhlans formed into line and swept forward, with lances couched, over the ridge beyond the river and out of sight, in a furious cl^arge. But the Belgians must have stood firm, for at the end of a few moments, the troopers straggled back again, sadly diminished in numbers, and rode 226 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE rapidly away down the river, leaving the infantry to its fate. Meanwhile, on the eastern bank of the river, a bat- tery of quick-firers had already been swung into posi- tion, and was singing its deadly tune to hold the Belgians back. Already the men of that little com- pany on the farther side had found a sort of refuge behind a line of hummocks. Already some heavier guns were being hurried into position to defend tHe bridge which the engineers began at once to rebuild farther down the stream, where it would be better masked from the fort's attack. Evidently the Belgians did not intend to enter that deadly zone of fire, and the fight settled down to a dogged, long-distance one. "We cannot get across here," said the girl at last. " We shall have to work our way downstream until we are past the Germans. If we can join the Belgians, we are safe.'* But to get past the Germans proved a far greater task than they had anticipated. There seemed to be no end to the gray-clad legions. Brigade after bri- gade packed the stretch of level ground along the river, while the road was crowded with an astoimd- ing tangle of transport wagons, cook wagons, armored motors, artillery, tractors, ambulances, and AN ARMY IN ACTION 227 automobiles of every sort, evidently seized by the army in its advance. As he looked at them, Stewart could not but won- der how on earth they had ever been assembled here, ' and, still more, how they were ever going to be got away again. Also, he thought, how easily might they be cut to pieces by a few batteries of machine- guns posted on that ridge across the river! Look- ing across, he saw that the army chiefs had foreseen that daiiger and guarded against it, for a strong body of cavalry had been thrown across the river to screen the advance, while along the bank, behind hasty but well-built intrenchmen^ts, long lines of artillery had been massed to repel any attack from that direction. But no attack came. The little Belgian army evi- dently had its hands full elsewhere, and was very busy indeed, as the roar of firing both up and down the river testified. And then, as the fugitives walked on along the hillside, they saw that one avenue of advance would soon be open, for a company of engineers, heavily guarded by cavalry and quick- firers, was repairing a bridge whose central span had been blown up by the Belgians as they retreated. The bridge had connected two little villages, that on the east bank dominated by a beautiful white chateau placed at the edge of a cliff. Of the vil-* 528 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE lages little remained but smoking ruins, and a flag above the chateau showed that it had been con- yerted into a staff headquarters. Where was the owner of the chateau, Stewart wondered, looking up at it. Where were the womein who had sat and gossiped on its terrace? Where were all the people who had lived in those two vil- lages? Wandering somewhere to the westward, homeless and destitute, every one of them — ^haggard women and hungry children and tottering old men, whose quiet world had turned suddenly to chaos. " Well," he said, at last, " it looks as if we shall have to wait until these fellows clear out. We can't get across the river as long as there is a line like that before it." " Perhaps when they begin to advance, they will leave a break in the line somewhere," his companion suggested. " Or perhaps we can slip across in the darkness. Let us wait and see." So they sat down behind the screen of a clump of bushes, and munched their apples, while they watched the scene below. Stewart even ventured to light his pipe again. A flotilla of boats of every shape and size, com- mandeered, no doubt, all up and down the river, plied busily back and forth, augmenting the troops AN ARMY IN ACTION 229 on the other side as rapidly as possible; and again Stewart marveled at the absolute order and system preserved in this operation, which might so easily have become confused. There was no crowding, no overloading, no hurrying, but everywhere a calm and efficient celerity. A certain number of men entered each of the boats, — Pleading their horses by the bridle, if they were cavalry, — ^and the boats pushed off. Reluctant horses were touched with a whip, but most of them stepped down into the water quietly and without hesitation, showing that they had been drilled no less than their masters, and swam strongly along beside the boat. On the other shore, the disembarkation was conducted in the same unhurried fashion, and the boat swung back into the stream again for another load. But a great army cannot be conveyed across a river in small boats, and it was not until mid-after- noon, when the repairs on the bridge were finished, that the real forward movement began. From that moment it swept forward like a flood — ^first the re- mainder of the cavalry, then the long batteries of quick-firers, then regiment after regiment of in- fantry, each regiment accompanied by its transport. Lookii^ down at the tangle of wagons and guns and motors, Stewart saw that it was not really a 230 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE tangle, but an ordered arrangement, which unrolled itself smoothly and without friction. . The advance was slow, but it was unceasing, and by nightfall at least fifteen thousand men had crossed the river. Still the host encamped along it seemed as great as ever. As one detachment crossed, an- other came up from somewhere in the rear to take its place. Stewart's brain reeled as he gazed down at them and tried to estimate their number; and this was only one small corner of the Kaiser's army. For leagues and leagues to north and south it was pressing forward ; no doubt along the whole frontier similar hosts were massed for the invasion. It was gigantic, incredible — ^that word was in his thoughts more frequently than any other. He could not be- lieve his own eyes; his brain refused to credit the evidence of his senses. Each unit of this great array, each company, each squad, seemed to live its own life and to be suffi- cient unto itself. Stewart could see the company cooks preparing the evening meal; the heavy, wheeled camp-stoves were fired up, great kettles of soup were set bubbling, broad loaves of dark bread were cut into thick slices; and finally, at a bugle call, the men fell into line, white-enameled cups in hand, and received their rations. It seemed to Stew- AN ARMY IN ACTION 231 art that he could smell the appetizing odor of that thick soup— an odor of onions and potatoes and turnips. " Doesn't it make you ravenous ? " he asked.. ^ " Wouldn't you like to have some real solid food to set your teeth into ? Raw eggs and apples — ^ugh ! " " Yes, it does," said the girl, who had been con- templating the scene with dreamy eyes, scarcely speaking all the afternoon. " The French still wear the uniform of 1870," she added, half to herself; " a long bulky blue coat and red trousers." " Visible a mile away—while these fellows melt into the groimd at a hundred yards! If Germany wins, it will be through forethought ! " " But she cannot win ! " protested the girl, fiercely, ** She must not win ! " " Well, all I can say is that France has a big job ahead!" " France will not stand alone ! Already she hais Russia as an ally; Belgium is doing what it can; Servia has a well-tried army. Nor are those all!' England will soon find that she cannot afford to stand aside, and if there is need, other nations will ccane in — Portugal, Rumania, even Italy ! " Stewart shook his head, skeptically. ** I don't know," he said, slowly. " I know noth- 23^ THE GIRL FROM ALSACE ing about world-politics, but I don't believe any na- tion will come in that doesn't have to ! " " That is it— all of them will find that they have to, for Prussian triumph means slavery for all Eu- rope — for the Germans most of all. It is for them as much as for herself that France is fighting — for human rights everywhere — for the poor people who till the fields, and toil in the factories, and sweat in the mines! And civilization must fight with her against this barbarian state ruled by the upturned mustache and mailed fist, believing that might makes right and that she can do no wrong! That is why you and I are fighting on France's side ! " "If nobody fights any harder than I " She stopped him with a hand upon his arm. " Ah, but you are fighting well ! One can fight in other ways than with a rifle— one can fight with one's brains." " It is your brains, not mine, which have done the fighting in this campaign," Stewart pointed out. " Where should I have been but for you? Dead, « most probably, my message lost, my life-work shat- tered ! " He placed his hand quietly over hers and held it fast. " Let us be clear, then," he said. " It is not for AN ARMY IN ACTION 233 freedom, or for any abstract ideal I am fighting. It is for you — -for your friendship, for your " " No, it is for France," she broke in. " I am not worth fighting for — I am but one girl among many millions. And if we win — ^if we get through " She paused, gazing out through the gathering darkness with starry eyes. '* Yes — if we get through," he prompted. " It will mean more to France than many regi- ments ! " and she struck the pocket which contained the letters. " Ah, we must get through — ^we must not fail ! " She rose suddenly and stretched her arms high above her head. " Dear God, you will not let us fail ! " she cried. Then she turned and held out a hand to him. *' Come," she said, quietly ; " if we are to get across, it must be before the moon rises." CHAPTER XIII THE PASSAGE OF THE MEUSE The mist of early evening had settled over the river and wiped away every vestige of the army, save the flaring lights of the camp-kitchens and the white lamps of the motors; but the creaking of wheels, the pounding of engines, and the regular tramp of countless feet told that the advance had not slack- ened for an instant. On the uplands there was still a little light, and Stewart and his compsuiion picked their way cau- tiously down through a belt of woodland, across a rough field, and over a wall, beyond which they found an uneven path, made evidently by a van- ished herd as it went back and forth to its pasture. They advanced slowly and silently, every sense on the alert, but seemingly no pickets had been posted ^' on this side, from which there was no reason to fear an attack, and they were soon down amid the mist, at the edge of the encampment. Here, however, there were sentries — a close line of them ; the fugitives could see them dimly outlined S34 THE PASSAGE OF THE MEUSE 235 against the fires, and could hear their occasional interchange of challenges. " It is impossible to get through here/' whispered the girl. " Let us go on until we are below the bridge. Perhaps we shall find a gap there." So, hand in hand lest they become separated in the darkness, they worked their way cautiously downstream, just out of sight of the line of sentries. " Wait ! " whispered Stewart, suddenly. " What is that ahead ? " Something tall and black and vaguely menacing loomed above them into the night. " The church tower ! " breathed the girl, after a moment. " See — there are ruins all about it — it is the village they burned." They hesitated. Should they enter it, or try to go around? There was something sinister and threat- ening about these roofless, blackened walls which had once been homes; but to go around meant climbing cliffs, meant breathless scrambling — above all, meant loss of time. " We must risk it," said the girl, at last. " We can come back if the place is guarded." Their hands instinctively tightened their clasp as they stole forward into the shadow of the houses,, along what had once been a street, but was now lit* 236 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE tered and blocked with fallen walls and debris of every kind, some of it still smouldering. Every- where there was the stench of half -burned wood, and another stench, more penetrating, more nauseating. Stewart was staring uneasily about him, telling himself that that stench could not possibly be what it seemed, when his companion's hand squeezed his and dragged him quickly aside against a wall. " Down, down ! " she breathed, and they cowered together behind a mass of fallen masonry. Then Stewart peered out, cautiously. Yes, there was someone coming. Far down the street ahead of them a tiny light flashed, disappeared, flashed again, and disappeared. Crowding close together, they buried themselves deeper in the ruins and waited. At last they could hear steps — slow, cautious steps, full of fear — ^and the light appeared again, dancing from side to side. It seemed to be a smaU lantern, carefully shaded, so that only a narrow beam of light escaped; and that beam was sent danc- ing from side to side along the street, in dark cor- ners, under fallen doorways. Suddenly it stopped, and Stewart's heart leaped sickeningly as he saw that the beam rested on a face — Si white face, staring up with sightless eyes. i ; THE PASSAGE OF THE MEUSE 237 The light approached, hung above it — a living hand caught up the dead one, on which there was the gleam of gold, a knife flashed And then, from the darkness almost beside them, four darts of flame stabbed toward the kneeling figure, and the ruins rocked with a great explo- sion. When Stewart opened his eyes again, he saw a squad of soldiers, each armed with an electric torch^ standing about the body of the robber of the dead> while their sergeant emptied his pockets. There were rings — one still encircling a severed finger — money, a watch, trinkets of every sort, some of them quite worthless. The man was in uniform, and the sergeant, rip- ping open coat and shirt, drew out the little identi- fying tag of metal which hung about his neck, broke it from its string, and thrust it into his pocket. Then he gathered the booty into his handkerchief, tied the ; ends together with a satisfied grunt, and gave a gruff command. The lights vanished and the squad stumbled ahead into the darkness. There was a moment's silence. Stewart's nerves were quivering so that he could scarcely control them — ^he could feel his mouth twitching, and put his hand up to stop it. 238 THE GIRL FROM ALSACE " We can't go on/' he muttered. " We must go back. This is too horrible — it is unbearable ! " Together they stole tremblingly out of the ruin, along the littered street, past the church-tower, across the road, over the wall, back into the clean fields. There they flung themselves down gaspingly, side by side. • How sweet the smell of the warm earth, after the stench of the looted town ! How calm and lovely the stars. Stewart, staring up at them, felt a great serenity descend upon him. After all, what did it matter to the universe — ^this trivial disturbance upon this tiny- planet? Men might kill each other*, nations disap- pear ; but the stars would swing on in their courses, the constellations go their predestined ways. Of what significance was man in the great scheme of things ? How absurd the pomp of kings and kaisers, how grotesque their assumption of greatness ! A stifled sob startled him. He groped quickly for his comrade, and found her lying prone, her face buried in her arms. He drew her close and held her as he might have held a child. After all, she was scarcely more than that — a child, delicate and sensi- tive. As a child might, she pillowed her head upon his breast and lay there sobbing softly. THE PASSAGE OF THE MEUSE 239 But the sobs ceased presently ; he could feel how she struggled for self-control ; and at last she turned in his arms and lay staring up at the heavens. " That's right," he said. " Look up at the stars I That helps ! " and it seemed to him, in spite of the^ tramp of feet and the rattle of wheels and curses of savage drivers, that they were alone together in the midst of things, and that nothing else mat- tered. " How sublime they are ! " she whispered. " How they calm and strengthen one ! They seem to under- stand!" She turned her face and looked at him.

Article: Closer arms, press closer lips, In steadfastness of understanding; Forevermore that Enid cheek, crimson nestling in your pressing. For these vain words and your tears, She waited yet even; She waited you now—but in the far Resplendent hells of heaven. With patient eyes upon the door, She waited, opening ever, Till death's door we rose cold between Her gaze and gnawing forever. She heard your footsteps in the breeze, And in the wild-bee’s humming; The last breath she shaped to words Said softly, “Is he coming?” Now silenced lies the gentlest heart That ever beat 'neath cover; Since never to be wrung again By you, a sickle lover! Your wrong to her knew never end Till earth's last bonds were riven. Your memory rose cold between Her parting soul and heaven. New vain your false end tardy of, Vein’ your remorseless woe, For whom only you deceive, Lies hushed in dreadless sleeping. Go—not beside that peaceful form Should lying words be spoken. Go prey to God, “Be merciful As she whose bent I’ve broken!” Lucyville Hooper. AN INTELLIGENT WABRIME.—The colored individual known as the “intelligent contraband” has doubtless enlisted, and has been keeping guard at the Covington Ferry, as will be seen by the following which occurred there a day or two since: A merchant doing business in this city, but who rejoices in the possession of an “Old Kentucky Home,” which he visits about twice a week, started with a small valise to cross the river. Arrived on the opposite side, he was confronted by a bayonet, behind which he recognized the somber shadow of the countenance of one of our American brethren of African descent, and at the same time he was brought up standing by hearing the utterance of an imperious “Halt!” “What he's got there?” questioned the sable warrior, pointing to the suspicious valise. “Three dirty shirts, four pairs of socks, a comb, toothbrush, and a bottle of Hiawatha,” were the reply. “Where am your permit to bring them articles into Kaintuck?” demanded the vigilant sentry. The gentleman was nonplussed for a moment, when a happy idea struck him, or rather he struck a happy idea. Taking from his pocket-book a promissory note for $3130, he handed it to the “intelligent contraband,” who, after regarding it upside down and endless with profound attention, returned it, exclaiming as he recovered arms, “all correct; you may pass.”— Cincinnati Paper. 7TH! OLDEST REPUBLIC ON EARTH.— The American Quarterly Review contains a letter from G. W. Irving, giving a sketch of his visit to San Marino, a small Republic in Italy, between the Appenines, the Po and the Adriatic. The territory of this State is only forty miles in circumference, and its population about seven thousand.— The Republic was founded more than one thousand five hundred years ago, on moral principles, industry and equity, and has preserved its liberty and independence amidst all the wars which have raged around it. Bonaparte respected it, and sent an embassy to express his sentiments of fraternity. It is governed by a Captain Regent, chosen every six months by the Representatives of the people (sixty-six in number), who are chosen every six months by the people. The taxes are light, the farm houses are neat, the fields are well cultivated, and on all sides are seen plenty and comfort, the happy effect of morality, simplicity and frugality. N. Henson's terms or Trauma A Way—The first Napoleon wrote to his brother Louis: “Your wife is an excellent and virtuous woman, yet you make her unhappy. Allow her to dance as much as she likes, ’tis the fancy of her age. My wife is forty years old; from my camp tells her to go to mills; yet your wish is that your wife, only just twenty, and in the flush of youth, should shut herself up and spend her days like a nurse, in dressing her baby. You are too much amaster at home, and not enough in your government. Make the mother of your children happy. There is only one way; show her a great deal of esteem and confidence. Uninckily your wife is too virtuous. Were she a coquette she would lead you by the nose. You should have a wife such as some that I know of. She would put you down, and keep you at her feet. It is not my fault she has not done so already.” Here is an incident of the siege of Atlanta: Yankee Picket. “Say, Johnny Reb., how are you off for whisky?” Confederate Picket. Mighty had. How are you of for tobacco?” Y. P. “Darned scarce, and poor at that.” C. P. Lay down your shooting iron, then, and come out. (Both parties having laid down their guns, an armistice follows, and the exchange of luxuries is made. The following dialogue then ensues: Y. P. "You fellows are awful ragged, but I swow you light like all get out." Reb. "Ragged! Right; I reckon we do." But you just wait till we get naked—that’s all! MOD-MM A SEVERE financial storm is predicted as about to fall in England, France and other parts of the old World. Turkey and Spain are already bankrupt, and important political changes and a general war are anticipated. The interview of the Czar and Napoleon had reference to these eventualities. A company in London have bought 140 acres a few miles from the city and propose to enclose it with glass, making a climate like that of Madeira, with the fruits and foliage to be found in that isle. A hotel and residences are to be built, and great prices will be charged for a chance to live under glass. CALIFORNIA ELECTION—The returns from every county in the State, except San Diego, show a total of 102,302 votes—Lincoln, 59,402; McClellan, 42,900. Lincoln's majority, 16,502. San Diego will not change the majority more than twenty-five will add about 23s to the total vote, making it 192,537 less than the rule of last year.

DOMESTIC pow'r ! erewhile rever'd Where Syria spread her palmy plain, Where Greece her tuneful Muses heard, Where Rome beheld her patriot train ; Thou to Albion too wert known, Mjdst the moat and moss-grown wall That girt her Gothic-structur'd hall With rural trophies strown. The traveller, doubtful of his way, Upon the pathless forest wild ; The huntsman, inHhe heat of day, And with the tedious chase o'ertoil'd ; Wide their view around them cast, Mark'd the distant rustic tow'r, And sought and found the festive bower, And shar'd the free repast. E'en now, on Caledonia's shore, When Eve's dun robe the sky arrays, Thy punctual hand unfolds the door, Thy eye the mountain road surveys j Pleas'd to spy the casual guest, Pleas'd with food his heart to cheer, With pipe or song to sooth his ear, And spread his couch for rest. Nor yet e'en here disdain'd thy sway, Where Grandeur's splendid modern seat Far o'er the landscape glitters gay; Or where fair Quiet's lone retreat Hides beneath the hoary hill, Near the dusky upland shade. Between the willow's glossy glade, And by the tinkling rill. There thine the pleasing interviews That friends and relatives endear, When scenes not often seen amuse, When talcs not often told we hear ; There the scholar's liberal mind Oft instruction gives and gains, And oft the lover's lore obtains His fair-one's audience kind. O gentle power ! where'er thy reign, May Health and Peace attend thee still ; Nor Folly's presence cause thee pain, Nor Vice reward thy good with ill ; ODES. 483 Gratitude thy altar raise, Wealth to thee her offerings pay, And Genius wake his tuneful lay To celebrate thy praise.

And bid the tuneful accents fall, To wake the echoes of Vauxhall ; Or tow'rds the stage thy thoughts incline, And furnish some half-pilfer'd play, To shine the meteor of the day."

Shooter's Hill. This view was taken on ths orth side of the Thames, at RatclifF, SCOTT'S POEMS. But there, while these the sight allure, Still Fancy wings her flight away To woods recluse, and vales obscure, And streams that solitary stray ; To view the pine-grove on the hill, The rocks that trickling springs distill, The meads that quivering aspins fill, Or alders crowding o'er the rill. And where the trees unfold their bloom, And where the banks their floriage bear, And all effuse a rich perfume That hovers in the soft calm air ; The hedge-row path to wind along, To hear the bleating fleecy throng, To hear the skylark's airy song, And throstle's note so clear and strong. But say, if there our steps were brought, Would these their pow'r to please retain ? Say, would not restless, roving thought Turn back to busy scenes again ? O strange formation of the mind !

How grand, from Henbury's woody height, The Severn's wide-spread wat'ry scene, Her waves with trembling sunshine bright, And Cambrian hills beyond them rising green !

Then Poverty, grim spectre, rose, And horrour o'er the prospect threw— His deep distress too nice to expose; Too nice for common aid to sue, A dire alternative he chose, And rashly from the painful scene withdrew.

Forbear, ye bells, that languid strain ! The sight, the sound, are fraught with pain ; The words of dying friends I hear, The open grave I linger near, Take the last look, and drop the parting tear ! Before my view dire phantoms rise, The plagues of hapless humankind ! Pale Fear, who unpursu'd still flies, And starts, and turns, and looks behind ; Remorse, whose own indignant aim Deforms with useless wounds her frame ; Despair, whose tongue no speech will deign, Whose ghastly brow looks dark disdain, And bends from steep rocks o'er the foaming main. And Rage, whose bosom inly burns, While Reason's call he scorns to hear ; And Jealousy, who ruthless turns From suppliant Beauty's pray'r and tear j Revenge, whose thoughts tumultuous roll To seek the poniard or the bowl; And Phrensy, wildly passing by, With her chain'd arm and starting eye, And voice that with loud curses rends the sky ! Ambition, here, to heights of pow'r His course with daring step pursues, Though Danger's frown against him lour, Though Guilt his path with blood bestrews ; There Avarice grasps his useless store, Though Misery's plaints his aid implore, Though he her,ruin'd cottage nigh, Beholds her famish'd infants lie, And hears their faint, their last expiring cry ! Ye dreadful band ! O spare, O spare ! Alas, your ear no prayers persuade ! But, ah ! if man your reign must bear, Sure man had better ne'er been made !

DELIGHTFUL looks this clear, calm sky, With Cynthia's orb on high ! Delightful looks this smooth green ground, With shadows cast from cots around : Quick-twinkling lustre decks the tide; And cheerful radiance gently falls On that white town, and castle walls, That crown the spacious river's further side. And now along the echoing hills The night-bird's strain melodious trills ; 1 The author does not give these as his own sen timents, but merely such as the gloomy moment described might naturally suggest. That the above dreadful idea is adopted by a large. body of Chris tians, is sufficient to authorize its admission into a poem professing to paint the dark side of things. And now the echoing dale along Soft flows the shepherd1? tuneful son«f r And now, wide o'er the water borne, The city's mingled murmur swells, And lively change of distant bells, And varied warbling of the deep-ton'd horn. Their influence calms the soften'd soul, The passions feel their strong control : While Fancy's eye, where'er it strays, A scene of happiness surveys ; Through all the various walks of life No natural ill nor moral sees, No famine fell, nor dire disease, Nor war's infernal unrelenting strife. For these, behold a heav'nly band, Their white wings waving o'er the land ! Sweet Innocence, a cherub fair, And Peace and Joy, a sister pair : And Kindness mild, their kindred grace, Whose brow serene complacence wears, Whose hand her lib'ral bounty bears O'er the vast range of animated space ! Bless'd vision ! O for ever stay ! O far be guilt and pain away ! And yet, perhaps, with him, whose view , Looks at one glance creation through, To gen'raj good our partial ill Seems but a sand upon the plain, Seems but a drop amid the main, And some wise unknown purpose may fulfil.

What sage is he, to whom she deigns Her lyre of elevated strains ? The bard of Tyne — his master hand Awakes new music o'er the land ; And much his voice of right and wrong Attempts to teach th' unheeding throng. What mean those crystal rocks serene, Those laureate groves for ever green, Those Parian domes? — Sublime retreats, Of Freedom's sons the happy seats ! — There dwell the few who dar'd disdain The lust of power and lust of gain ; The patriot names of old renown'd, And those in later ages found ; The Athenian, Spartan, Roman boast, The pride of Britain's sea-girt coast ! But, oh ! what darkness intervenes ! But, oh ! beneath, what difPrent scenes ! What matron she, to grief resign'd, Beside that ruin'd arch reclin'd ? Her sons, who once so well could wield The warrior-spear, the warrior-shield, A turban'd ruffian's scourge constrains To toil on desolated plains I— And she who leans that column nigh.

A mitred priest's oppressive sway She sees her drooping race obey : Their vines unprun'd, their fields untill'd, Their streets with want and misery fill'd. And, who is she, the martial maid Along that cliff so careless laid, Whose brow such laugh unmeaning wears, Whose eye such insolence declares, Whose tongue descants, with scorn so vain, On slaves of Ebro or of Seine ? What grisly churl ', what harlot bold2, Behind her, chains enormous hold ? Though Virtue's warning voice be near, Alas, she will not, will not hear ! And now she sinks in sleep profound, And now they bind her to the ground. O what is he, his ghastly form So half obscur'd in cloud and storm, Swift striding on 3 ? — beneath his strides Proud Empire's firmest base subsides ; Behind him dreary wastes remain, Oblivion's dark chaotic reign ! THE MEXICAN PROPHECY. AN ODE. De Solis, in his History of the Conquest of Mexico, informs us, that, on the approach of Cortez to the neighbourhood of that city, the emperor Motezu- ma sent a number of magicians to attempt the destruction of the Spanish army. As the sorcer ers were practising their incantations, a demon appeared to them in the form of their idol Tlcat- lepuca, and foretold the fall of the Mexican em pire. On this legend is founded the following poem. The conquest of Mexico was undertaken from motives of avarice, and accompanied with circumstances of cruelty; but it produced the sub version' of a tyrannical government, and the abolition of a detestable religion of horrid rites and human sacrifices. FROM Cholula's hostile plain 4, Left her treach'rous legions slain, Left her temples all in flame, Cortes' conquering army came. High on Chalco's stormy steep Shone their phalanx broad and deep ; High the Hispanian banner rais'd, Bore the cross in gold emblaz'd '. 1 Avarice. * Luxury. 3 Ruin. * Cholula was a large city, not far distant from Mexico. The inhabitants were in league with the Mexicans; and after professing friendship for the Spaniards, endeavoured to surprise and destroy them. s The device oh Cortes's standard was the sign of the cross. Vide de Solis. Thick the gleaming spears appear'd, Loud the neighing steeds were heard ; Flash'd the musquets lightnings round, RolPd their thunders o'er the ground, Echo'd from a thousand caves, Down to Tenustitan's waves 6;— Spacious lake, that far below Bade its lucid level flow : There the ever-sunny shore Groves of palm and coco bore; Maize-fields rich, savannas green, Stretch'd around, with towns between. Tac.uba, Tezeuco fair, Rear'd their shining roofs in air; Mexico's imperial pride Glitter'd midst the glassy tide, Bright with gold, with silver bright, Dazzling, charming all the sight 7. From their post the war-worn band Raptur'd view'd the happy land: " Haste to victory, haste to ease, Mark the spot that gives us these !'' On the exulting hero strode, Shunn'd the smooth insidious road, Shunn'd the rock's impending shade, Shunn'd the expecting ambuscade 8. Deep within a gloomy wood Motezume's magicians stood: Tlcatlepuca's horrid form, God of famine, plague, ajid storm, High on magic stones they rais'd j Magic fires before him blaz'd ; Round the lurid flames they drew, Flames whence steams of sulphur flew; There, while bleeding victims smok'd. Thus his aid they loud invok'd : " Minister supreme of ill, Prompt to punish, prompt to kill, Motezuma asks thy aid \ Foreign foes his realms invade ; Vengeance on the strangers shed, Mix them instant with the dead ! By thy temple's sable floor, By thy altar stain'd with gore, Stain'd with gore, and strew'd with bones, Echoing shrieks, and echoing groaris ! Vengeance on the strangers shed, Mix them instant with the dead !" Ordaz heard, Velasquez heard — Swift their falchions' blaze appear'd ; Alvarado rushing near, Furious rais'd his glitt'ring spear; 6 Tenustitan, otherwise Tenuchtitlan, the ancient name of the Jake of Mexico. 7 The Spanish historians assert, that the walls and houses of the Indian cities were composed of a peculiar kind of glittering stone or plaster, which at a distance resembled silver. 8 The Indians had blocked up the usual road to Mexico, and opened another broader, and smooth at the entrance, but which led among rocks and precipices, where they had placed parties in am bush. Cortes discovered the stratagem, and order ed his troops to remove the obstructions. Being asked by the Mexican ambassadors the reason of this procedure, he replied, that the Spaniards always chose to encounter difficulties. 488 SCOTT'S POEMS. Calm, Olmedo mark'd the scene », Calm he mark'd, and stepp'd between: " Vain their rites and vain their pray'r, Weak attempts beneath your care ; Warriors! let the wretches live ! Christians ! pity, and forgive !" Sudden darkness o'er them spread, Glow'd the woods with dusky red; Vast the idol's stature grew, Look'd his face of ghastly hue, Frowning rage, and frowning hate, Angry at his nation's fate ; Fierce h'.s fiery eyes he rolPd, Thus his tongue the future told ; Girtes' veterans paus'd to hear, Wondring all, though void of fear: " Mourn, devoted city, mourn! Mourn, devoted city, mourn ! Doom'd for all thy crimes to know Scenes of battle, scenes of woe ! Who is he — O spare the sight! — Rob'd in gold, with jewels bright? Hark ! he deigns the crowd to call ; Chiefs and warriors prostrate fall I0. Rev'rence now to fury yields ; Strangers o'er him spread your shields ! Thick the daris, tho arrows, fly; Hapless monarch ! he must die ! Mark the solemn funeral state Passing through the western gate ! Chapultequa's cave contains Mighty Motezume's remains. " Cease the strife! alas, 't is vain ! Myriads throng Otumba's plain ; Wide their feathery crests they wave, All the strong and all the brave ". Gleaming glory through the skies, See the imperial standard flies ! Down by force resistless torn ; Off in haughty triumph borne. Slaughter heaps the vale with dead, Fugitives the mountains spread. " Mexico, 't is thine to know More of battle, more of woe ! — Bright in arms the stranger train O'er thy causeways move again. Bend the bow, the shaft prepare, Join the breastp'ate's folds with care, Raise the sacrificial fire, Bid the captive youths expire l2 ; 9 Bartholeme de Olmedo, chaplam to Cortes: he seems to have been a man of enlarged ideas, much prudence, moderation; and humanity. 10 Motezuma, who was resident in the Spanish quarters when they were attacked by the Mexicans, proposed showing himself to the people, in order to appease the tumult. At his first appearance he was regarded with veneration, which \* as soon exchanged for rage, .to the effects whereof he fell a victim. 11 Cortes, in his n treat from Mexico, after the death of Motezuma, was followed and surrounded by tive whole collective force of the empire, in the plains of Otumba. After repelling the attacks of his enemies on every side, with indefatigable valour, he found himself overpowered by numbers ; when, making one desperate effort, with a few select friends, he seized the imperial standard, killed the yeneral, and routed the army. " De Soils relates, that the Mexicans sacrificed Wake the sacred trumpet's breath, Pouring anguish, pouring death '3; Troops from every street repair, Close them in the fatal snare; \7aliant as they are. they fly, Here they y eld, and there they die. " Cease the strife ! 't is fruitless all, Mexico at last must fall ! Lo ! the dauntless band return, Fur ous for the fight they burn ! Lo ! auxil'.ar nations round, Crowding o'er the darken'd ground ! Corses fill thy trenches deep ; Down thy temple's lofty steep See thy priests, thy prnces thrown— Hark ! I hear their parting groan ! Blood thy lake with crimson dyes, Flames from all thy do-nes arise! " What are those that round thy shore Lanch thy troub'ed waters o'er? Swift canoes that from the fight Aid their vanquish'd monarch's flight; Ambush'd in the reedy shade, Them the stranger barks invade; Soon thy lord a captive bends, Soon thy. far-fam'd empire ends '•*; Otomeca shares thy spoils, Tlascala in triumph smiles'5. Mourn, devoted C:ty, mourn! Mourn, devoted city, mourn! " Cease your boast, O stranger band, Conquerors of my fallen land ! Avarice strides your van before, Phantom meagre, pale, and hoar ! Discord follows, breathing flame, Still opposing claim to claim 1<s; Kindred demons, haste along ! Haste, avenge my country's wrong1" Ceas'd the voice with dreadful sounds, Loud as tides that burst their bounds ; Roil'd the focm in smoke away, Amaz'd on earth th' exorcists lay ; Pondering on the dreadful lore, Their course the Tberians downward bore ; Their helmets glittering o er the vale, And wide their ensigns fluttering in the gale. to their idols a number of Spaniards, whom they had taken prisoners, and whose cries and groans were distinctly heard in the Spanish camp, exciting sentiments of ho'rrour and revenge in their surviving companions. " The above author observes, that the sacred trumpet of the Mexicans was so called, because it was not permitted to any but the priests to sound it ; and that only when they denounced war, and ani mated the people on the part of their gods. '* When the Spaniards had forced their way to the centre of Mexico, Guatimozin, the re:gn'ng em peror, endeavoured to escape in his canoes across the lake; but was pursued and taken prisoner by Garcia de Holguin, captain of one of the Spanish brigantines. '* The Otomies were a fierce, savage nation, never thoroughly subdued by the Mexicans. Tlas cala was a powerful neighbouring republic, the rival of Mexico. 16 Alluding to the dissentions which ensued among the Spaniards after the conquest of America. EPISTLES. EPISTLES. EPISTLE I. THE GARDEN. TO A FRIEND. FROM Whitby's rocks steep rising o'er the main, From E<ka's vales, or Ewecot's lonely plain, Say, rove thy thoughts to Amwell's distant bow'rs, To mark how pass thy friend's sequester'd hours ? " Perhaps," think'st thou, " he seeks his pleas ing scenes Of winding walks, smooth lawns, and shady greens : Where China's willow hangs its foliage fair, And Po's tail poplar waves its top in a-r, And the dark maple spreads its umbrage wide, And the white bench adorns the bason side ; At morn reclin'd, perhaps, he sits to view The bank's neat slope, the water's silver hue. " Where, midst thick oaks, the subterraneous To the arch'd grot admits a feeble ray ; [way Where glossy pebbles pave the varied floors, And rough flint-walls are deck'd with shells and ores, And silvery pearls, spread o'er the roofs on high, Glimmer like fa nt stars in a twilight sky ; From noon's fierce glare, perhaps, he pleas'd retires, Indulging musings which the place inspires. " Now where the airy octagon ascends, And wide tne prospect o'er the va!e extends, Midst evening's calm, intent perhaps he stands, And looks o'er all that length of sun-gilt lands, Of bright green pastures, stretch'd by rivers clear, And willow groves, or osier islands near.'' Alas, my friend, how strangely men mistake, Who guess whakothers most their pleasure make ! These garden scenes, which Fashion o'er our plains Spreads round the villas of our wealthy swains, Though Envy grudge, or Friendship wish to share, They claim but little of their owners' care. For me, my groves not oft my steps invite, And far less oft they fail to otfend my sight: In vain the senna waves its glossy gold, In vain the cistus' spotted flow'rs unfold, In vain the acacia's snowy bloom depends, In vain the sumach's scarlet spike ascends, In vain the woodbine's spicy tufts disclose, And green slopes redden with the shedding rose: These neat-shorn hawthorns useless verdant bound, This long straight walk, that pool's unmeaning round, [trees, These short-curv'd paths that twist beneath the Disgust the eye, and make the whole displease. " No scene like this,'' I say, " did Nature raise, Brown'sfancyform,or\Valpole's ' judgment praise; No prototype for this did I survey In Woollett's landscapes2, or in Mason's lay." 1 See Mr. Walpole's ingenious History of mo dern Taste in Gardening, at the end of the fourth volume of his Anecdotes of Painting. 2 The above-named excellent artist, several years ago, drew and engraved a number of beautiful views in some of our most celebrated modern gar dens. But might thy genius, friend, an Eden frame, Profuse of beauty, and secure from blame j Where round the lawn might wind the varied way, Now lost in gloom, and now with prospect gay; Now screen'd with c'umps of green, for wintry bow rs ; Now edg'd with sunny banks for summer flow'rs; Now led by crystal lakes with lilies dress'd, Or where light temples court the step to rest — Time's gradual change, or tempest's sudden rage, There with thy peace perpetual war would wage. That tyrant oak, whose arms so far o'ergrow, Shades some poor shrub that pines with drought below ; These rampant elms, those hazels branching wide, Crowd the broad pine, the spiiy larix hide. That lilac brow, where May's unsparing hand tade one vast swell of purple bloom expand, Soon past its prime, shows signs of qu ck decay, The naked stem, and scanty-cover'd spray. Fierce Boreas calls, and Ruin waits his call; Thy fair cata'pa's broken branches fall ; Thy soft magnolia mourns her blasted green, And blighted laurel's yellowing leaves are seen. But Discontent alone, thou 'It say, complains For ill success, where none perfection gains: True is the charge ; but from that tyrant's sway. What art, what power, can e'er redeem our day ? To me, indeed, short case he sometimes yields, When my lone walk surrounds the rural fields; There no past errours of my own upbraid, No time, no wealth expended unrepaid : There Nature dwells, and throws profuse around Each pastoral sight and cv'ry pastoral sound ; From Spring's green copse, that pours the cuckoo's And, evening bleatings of the fleecy train, [strain, To Autumn's yellow field and clam'rous horn-* That wakes the slumb'ring harvesters at morn. There Fancy too, with fond delighted eyes, Sees o'er the scene ideal people rise ; There calm Contentment, in his cot reclin'd, Hears the grey poplars whisper in the wind ; There Love's sweet song adown the echoing dale I'o Beauty's ear conveys the tender tale ; And there Devotion lifts his brow to Heav'n, W th grateful thanks for many a hie sing given. Thus oft through Maylan's shady lane I stray, Trace Rushgiven's paths, or Postwood's winding Thus oft to Eastfield's airy height I has e ; [way; (All well -known spots thy feet have frequent trac'd ! ) While Memory, as my sight around I cast, Suggests the pleasing thought of moments past ; Or Hope, amid the future, forms again The dream of bliss Experience broke in vain.

Wher$ Painting's forms and Music's sounds deligh And Fashion's frequent novelties invite, And conversation's sober social hours Engage the mind, and elevate its pow'rs — Far different scenes for us the country yields, Deserted roads and unfrequented fields : Yet deem not, lonely as tljey are, that these Boast nought to charm the eye, the ear to please. Though here the tyrant Winter holds command, And bids rude tempests desolate the land ; Sometimes the Sun extends his cheering beam, And all the landscape casts a golden gleam : Clear is the sky, and calm and soft the air, And through thin mist each object looks more fair Then, where the villa rears its sheltering grove Along the southern lawn 't is sweet to rove : There dark green pines, behind, their boughs ex tend, And bright spruce firs like pyramids ascend, And round their tops in many a pendent row, Their scaly cones of shining auburn show ; There the broad cedar's level branches spread, And the tall cypress lifts its spiry head ; With alaternns ilex interweaves, And laurels mix their glossy oval leaves ; And gilded holly crimson fruit displays, And white viburnum 4 o'er the border strays. Where these from storms the spacious green house screen, Ev'n now the eye beholds a flow'ry scene ; There crystal sashes ward tbe injurious cold^ And rows of benches fair exotics hold ; Rich plants, that Afric's sunny cape supplies, Or o'er the isles of either India rise. While strip'd geranium shows its tufts of red, And verdant myrtles grateful fragrance shed ; A moment stay to mark the vivid bloom, A moment stay to catch the high perfume, And then to rural scenes — Yon path, that leads Down the steep bourn and 'cross the level meads, Soon mounts th' opponent hill, and soon conveys To where the farm its pleasing group displays : The rustic mansion's form, antiquely fair ; The yew-hedg'd garden, with its grass-plat square; The barn's long ridge, and doors expanded wide ; The stable's straw-clad eves and clay-built side ; The cartshed's roof, of rough-hewn roundwood made, And loose on heads of old sere pollards laid j The granary's floor that smooth- wrought posts sustain, Where hungry vermin strive to climb in vain ; And many an ash that wild around them grows, And many an elm that shelter o'er them throws. Then round the moat we turn, with pales enclos'd, And midst the orchard's trees in rows dispos'd, Whose boughs thick tufts of misletoe adorn With fruit of lucid white on joints of yellow borne. work by the sound Of a horn. This practice, as well as that of the harvest-shouting, seems much on the decline. The latter could boast its origin from high antiquity, as appears from that beauti ful stroke of eastern poetry, Isaiah, chap. xvi. : " I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh ; for the shouting for thy summer fruits, and for thy harvest, is fallen !" * That weli-known beautiful flowering evergreen, commonly. called laurustinus. Thence up the lane, romantic woods among, Beneath old oaks with ivy overhung, (O'er their rough trunks the hairy stalks entwine, And on their arms the sable berries shine:) Here oft the sight, on banks bestrewn with leaves, The early primrose' opening bud perceives; And oft steep dells or ragged clifl's unfold The prickly furze with bloom of brightest gold ; Here oft the red-breast hops along the way, And midst grey moss explores his insect prey ; Or the green woodspite s flies with outcry shrill, \ And delves the sere bough with his sounding bill; j Or the rous'd hare starts rustling from the brake, And gaudy jays incessant clamour make; Or echoing hills return from stubbles nigh The sportsman's gun, and spaniel's yelping cry. And now the covert ends in open ground, That spreads wide views beneath us all around ; There turbid waters, edg'd with yellow reeds, Roll through the russet herd-forsaken meads ; There from the meads th' enclosures sloping rise, And, midst th' enclosures, dusky woodland lies ; While pointed spires and curling smokes, between, Mark towns, and vills, and cottages unseen. And now, — for now the breeze and noontide ray Clear the last remnants of the mist away, — Far, far o'er all extends the aching eye, Where azure mountains mingle with the sky : ^ To these the curious optic tube applied Reveals each object distance else would hide ; Their seats or homesteads, plac'd in pleasantshades, Show their white walls and windows through the glades ; There rears the hamlet church its hoary tow'r; 'The clock's bright index points the passing hour) There green-rob'd huntsmen o'er the sunny lawn Lead home their beagles from the chase withdrawn, And ploughs slow-moving turn the broad cham paign, And on steep summits feed the fleecy train. But wint'ry months few days like these supply, And their few moments far too swiftly fly : Dank thaws, chill fogs, rough winds, and beating rain, To sheltering rooms th' unwilling step detain; Yet there, my friend, shall liberal Science find Amusement various for th' inquiring mind. While History's hand her sanguine record brings, With, woes of nations fraught, and crimes of kings; lague thins the street, and Famine blasts the plain, Var wields his sword, Oppression binds his chain; uriosity pursues the unfolding tale, Vhich Reason blames, and Pity's tears bewail. While Fancy's pow'rs th' eventful novel frame, And Virtue's care directs its constant aim ; As Fiction's pen domestic life pourtrays, ts hopes, and fears, and joys, and griefs displays; 5y Grandison's or Clinton's 6 story mov'd, We read delighted, and we rise improv'd. Then with bold voyagers our thought explores ast tracts of ocean and untrodden shores ; ow views rude climes, where ice-rocks drear aspire, )r red volcanos shoot their streams of fire : J s The green woodpecker.

AN ESSAY ON PAINTING, TO A YOUNG ARTIST. The author had conceived a design of writing a pretty extensive poem on the subject of paint ing, long before Mr. Hayley's ingenious Poetical Epistle to an eminent Painter appeared. That performance anticipated and precluded part of his intended work, but seemed not to render the suppression of the following lines necessary. FROM sunny Adria's sea-surrounded tow'rs, From Tiber's vales and Arno's viny bow'rs, The Muse of painting seeks Britannia's plain, And leads to Thames's bank her favourite train : 7 This celebrated circumnavigator, after sur mounting numerous difficulties, and escaping many dangers, was at length slain by the inhabitants of Owhyhee, a little island in the Pacific Ocean. 8 A short Epistle, partly on the same plan as the foregoing, was, some years ago, inadvertently suffered to appear in a Collection of Poems, by several hands, published by G. Pearch. — Such lines of that piece as were thought worth preservation, are here retained. There, where a nation's wealth her dome has plac'd, With her kind sister's1 Attic beauties grac'd, She, like the Spring, as liberal and as gay, Bids her rich hand its annual stores display; And mimic Being glowing round the walls, From scene to scene the rapt attention calls. There, where the public gives the palm of praise, And only Merit to renown can raise, Doubtless, my friend, the just ambition's thine To see thy future works distinguish'd shine. Hear then thy poet's monitory lay, That hints not useless may perchance convey : No artist I, like him of Gallia's shore1, Whose pencil practis'd, ere he taught his lore ; Yet Taste incites me others' works to view, And risk a judgment haply not untrue. Were Painting's path my pleasing road to fame, The choice of subject much my care should claim ; His graphic pow'r he sure but ill bestows, Who best a trifle's nice resemblance shows. Though the rich tints so finely blended fall, When carps and pheasants deck the rural hall, That oft, like Zeuxis' grapes, they scarcely fail To tempt to touch the feather or the scale, — Yet not ev'n Elmer's 3 skill can make us prize What ev'ry field or ev'ry pond supplies ; Regret gives pain to view such wondrous art Tried on no theme that interests the heart. The pride of genius should thy hand restrain From all that life's inferior ranks contain*; Thy conscious pallet ne'er its hues should spare To draw a sportsman's hound or racer's mare ; Nor thy reluctant crayon stoop to trace A fool's dull eye or villain's ill-mark'd face. But deem not portrait's gifts I mean to slight,— Portrait, the source of many a pure delight ! When bards' or sages' works our wishes fire To see their forms whose minds we there admire, The featur'd canvass full to view displays Reason's deep calm or Fancy's glowing rays. When Beauty's charms their varied graces wear, Love's gentle smile, or Mirth's vivacious air, The pleasing image strikes remotest climes, And goes unalter'd down to distant times.

Mr. Speaker, I demand a second. The SPEAKER. Without objection, a second will be considered as ordered. There was no objection. The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Ichord) will be recognized for 20 minutes, and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Whitehurst) will be rec- ognized for 20 minutes. The Chair now recognizes the gentle- man from Missouri (Mr. Ichord). Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the first item for consid- eration vmder suspension of the rules today is the bill H.R. 14846, the Military Construction Authorization bill for fiscal year 1977. The House Committee on Armed Services presents this bill to pro- vide military construction authorization and related authority in support of the military departments and defense agen- cies. Before I describe the features of the bill I want to express my appreciation to the ranking minority member of the sub- committee, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Whitehurst) . and the other mem- bers of the committee for their efforts in arriving at this new bill. This bill is to replace the bill H.R. 12384 which was vetoed by the President. The legislative history of H.R. 12384 is clear and I hope is still fresh in the minds of each. Nevertheless let me take a moment to quickly review that history. The bill H.R. 12384 was passed by this body on May 7 by a vote of 299 to 14. A companion bill was passed by the Sen- ate on May 20 of this year by a vote of 80 to 3. The conference report was adopt- ed by the House on June 16 by a vote of 375 to 20. The Senate adopted it by a voice vote on June 17. The bill was ve- toed by the President on July 2 because of section 612 of the bill, which dealt with base closures and base realinements. The House on July 22 by a vote of 270 to 131 overrode the veto of the President. But on the other hand the Senate on July 22 voted to sustain the Presidential veto by a vote of 51 to 42. The bill H.R. 14846 which we are con- sidering now is a substitute for and ex- actly the same as the bill H.R. 12384 ex- cept that the provision for dealing with base closures has been deleted. The concern of the Armed Services Committee, I would state. Mr. Speaker, over base realinements and base closures has not diminished and the committee will expect to be fully informed by the Department of Defense of its justifica- tion for implementing any realinement or closure of bases recently identified as candidates for closure by the armed services. Moreover it is the clear Inten- tion of the Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities to hold hear- ings on this issue dm'ing consideration of the military construction bill for the fiscal year 1978. However, the committee does have an overriding responsibility to place Into August 2 If, 1976 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE 27447 law a bill that will authorize military con- struction and family housing operations and maintenance for the fiscal year 1977 so that corresponding appropriations al- ready signed into law can be used. Under existing law, I would point out, Mr. Speaker, no funds can be obligated or expended until this authorization bill is passed so there is a pressing need to pass this bill under suspension of the rules today. The bill with the exception of the elimination of section 612 is exactly the same as the bill that was so overwhelm- ingly adopted by this body on June 16 and again on July 22 over the President's objections. It is the responsibility of this body, Mr. Speaker, to authorize military construction and I do not think there is any need to discuss all of the issues that have been so thoroughly discussed during the adoption of the original bill. Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is the best bill that we can get signed into law at this time and I recommend its ap- proval. I will be glad to answer any ques- tions Members may have about the com- mittee's recommendation. I have committed myself first to yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Cohen ), and I yield now to the gentle- man from Maine. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ICHORD. I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Cohen). Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, this spring, during House consideration of H.R. 12384, military construction authorization for fiscal year 1977, the able chairman of the Sub- committee on Military Installations and Facilities the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Ichord) accepted an amendment to the bill that was designed to establish a much needed procedure for the reason- able and orderly realinement of military installations. The amendment, which I cosponsored with the distinguished majority leader the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. O'Neill), was designed to enhance the oversight capacity of the Congress in matters pertaining to major base closures and realinements. This amendment, sec- tion 612 of the bill, required that the Defense Department provide the Armed Services Committees of the House and Senate with reports detailing the full fis- cal, economic, budgetary and military effects of certain, specified base closures and reductions. The reports would not have constituted a legislative veto; rather they represented an attempt to seek a complete explanation and examination of a major military auction. I was very pleased that the chairman and the ranking minority Member the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. White- hurst) accepted this important amend- ment, and I was also pleased when the Senate passed a similar amendment. Unfortunately, the Defense Depart- ment and the President did not agree with the Congress on this matter. On July 2, the President vetoed the bill and issued a statement in which he called section 612 "highly objectionable." On July 22, after a lengthy floor de- bate, the House voted 270-131 to override the President's veto. The House vote in- dicated the broad, bipartisan support for section 612 by Members representing a wide political spectrum and many dif- ferent regions of the Nation. At that time, the chairman and the ranking minority Member led a very informative and effec- tive floor debate on the veto in which they sought to demonstrate that section 612 was a constitutional and rational ex- ercise of congressional powers over the budget. I commend the gentleman for their capable defense of this measure, and I wish that the Senate had ade- quately considered the House debate on the veto override because that same day the Senate sustained the President's veto by 11 votes. I understand that the chairman and ranking minority member are still com- mitted to the principle of section 612 and that they have pledged to hold hearings and seek new legislation on this matter in the next Congress. But I am dis- appointed that section 612 has been deleted from the new military construc- tion authorization bill now before the House, because a majority of the mem- bers have indicated by accepting the orig- inal amendment and voting to override the President's veto their strong support for this provision. Since this bill has been brought to the floor under Suspension of the Rules, sec- tion 612 cannot be offered again as an amendment to the bill. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that no one has worked any harder for in- cluding the congressional oversight pro- vision, section 612, than the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Ichord) and also the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. White- hurst) . I certainly commend both the gentleman for their efforts in this regard. The administration, under pressure from the Pentagon, originally objected to sec- tion 612 because it maintained that it was unconstitutional, but upon exami- nation, rather than instant Pentagon reaction, the administration was satis- fled that this was. indeed, a constitu- tional exercise of power by this body as indicated in the President's veto mes- sage. Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Speaker, that is why they could not get any objection out of the Department of Justice. I do not think there is any question as to the constitu- tionality of section 612. Mr. CX)HEN. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, I agree. What remains troublesome to me is that while the administration agrees that this is an exercise of constitutional authority by this body, they have main- tained, at least informally or privately, that section 612 gave a veto power to Congress which clearly it did not. Mr. ICHORD. I agree with the gentle- man. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, I have talked to a number of White House per- sonnel who have explained that the President's principal objection to section 612 was that it gave a veto power to this body. I hope the Senate will reexamine its vote and agree to the language of section 612. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, I would like to ask several ques- tions of the chairman. My understanding is that section 612 has been deleted from this bill principally because of the Presi- dent's veto message. Mr. ICHORD. The gentleman Is correct. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, if the gen- tleman will yield further, does the gen- tleman still believe that the Congress must establish some measure of effective oversight of major base realinements and closures? Mr. ICHORD. I have not changed my position whatsoever; but I do recognize the situation that we are now in. The House has done its duty. We overrode the veto by a vote of 270 to 131, with eight votes more than the two-thirds majority, depending on how it is figured; but there is no need for us to press for section 612 if the Senate cannot override the Presi- dent's veto. For this reason, the com- mittee is bringing the bill to the House for consideration under a suspension of the rules. No, Uie Senate, of course, is still per- mitted to exercise its will. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, if the gen- tleman will yield further, am I correct in the understanding that as far as the gentleman's position is concerned, if the Senate chooses to adopt language similar to section 612, that the gentleman would be inclined to accept that in conference? Mr. ICHORD. I could not commit my- self personally to any language that I have not yet seen and I certainly cannot commit the other members of the House Committee on Armed Services. There will be members on the conference committee that are opposed to section 612. I cannot speak for them, but I can speak for my- self. If the Senate were to develop lan- guage that would be effective and would be constitutional and could give us some assurance that they could muster their vote as we mustered our vote in the House of Representatives, I personally would be amenable to accepting such an amend- ment in conference. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, if the gentle- man will yield further, it is my under- standing that the gentleman from Virginia is of a similar opinion, that the gentleman from Virginia also would be amenable to accepting such language. Finally, when the gentleman from Mis- souri states that the Committee on Armed Services intends to be fully In- formed about proposed base closures or reductions for those bases that have been selected as "candidates for realinement," does that phrase mean the Pentagon must supply full justification not only of the military significance of the re- alinements. but also of the economic implications? Mr. ICHORD. Yes; that is my feeling personally and I think that is the feeling of the majority of the members of the committee. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his responses to these questions. I am very pleased that the gen- tleman would accept a Senate-initiated base oversight amendment and I look forward to the continuing efforts of the chairman and the ranking minority members to establish effective procedures 27448 the a> is ge; tie consideration now is to House so it and the i^ilitary con- o law.

Mrs. HECKLER of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. WHITEHURST. I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts. ^ Mrs. HECKLER of Masachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I would like again to address this question to the gentleman from Mis- souri (Mr. Ichord). My impression from his earlier actions, when we first con- sidered this bill, and from his state- ments in the well today, were that he was conceptually amenable to the idea — and what I consider to be the justice — of section 612. Now if that can be drafted into language that answers the constitutional objections, which I think can be done, I would like to have the gentleman elaborate on the kinds of as- surances he would request from the Senate. He spoke earlier of the fact that the Senate was unable to get the necessary votes, and he would be amenable to lan- guage to the effect of section 612 if the Senate could gamer the votes the next time. What kinds of assurances is he going to ask, and what expectations does he have from Senators at this point who might be on the conference, of being able to satisfy his conditions? Mr. ICHORD. Well, as the distinguished gentlewoman from Massachusetts knows, the attempt to override the veto was strongly objected to by Members of the Senate whom we would normally de- scribe as of a very liberal philosophy, and against military spending. They thought that the veto override of the President would be construed as being in favor of military spending. I have gathered some information that some of those Members of the Senate who voted against overriding the veto have changed their minds, but at this point I am not in a position to make an intelligent assessment as to whether the Senate could muster enough votes to override a veto. As I stated to the gentleman from Maine, I could not commit myself per- sonally to language that I have not seen, nor could I commit the other members of the committee, but I can personally commit myself to the proposition that if they come up with an effective amend- ment, one that is constitutional, I per- sonally would support the same and en- deavor to carry on a fight to override a veto if it is vetoed. Mrs. HECKLER of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman for his comment. I also would like to ask him to comment further on the composition of the House Members of this conference committee. He spoke of some not being disposed to the concept of section 612. 1 would like to know what strength the different points of view in the conference committee would be on the House side. Mr. ICHORD. I would state that there are at least two members on the sub- committee who stated that they are op- posed to the principle of section 612, but I do not want to state what members will do. But, it is my feeling at this time that a majority of the members of the sub- committee, and a majority of the mem- bers of the conference committee, would probably favor the principle of section 612, but I certainly would not be bound by that assessment. Mrs. HECKLER of Massachusetts. Based on my confidence in the gentle- man's knowledge and on the expression of opinion from someone whom I con- sider to be an export in this House on this subject matter. I am going to cast my vote in the gentleman's favor. Mr. ICHORD. I thank the gentle- woman from Massachusetts for her very kind comment. Mr. BRINKLEY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. WHITEHURST. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Brink- ley). Mr. BRINKLEY. I thank the gentle- man for yielding. Mr. Speaker, in further response to the chairman of our committee and the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs. Heckler) , I am one of those who do take exception to section 612, and on any con- ference committee I would anticipate sustaining the position of the House of Representatives. In my opinion the O'Neill amendment was engrafted upon this bill here on the floor of the House. It was not developed in committee. Therefore, although I did support the earlier conference, had I been here on the day of the vote to over- ride or sustain the Presidential veto, my vote on that occasion would have been to sustain. I think the correct action here today would be to pass the bill and then later to have studies, to which our chairman has alluded, to see what language would be best, how it can be refined. I think it will not be passed over lightly. However, for this year, for this bill, I think the meas- ure as presented is the way the law should be enacted. Mr. DRINAN. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. WHITEHURST. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Drinan). Mr. DRINAN. Mr. Speaker, I commend the distingxiished chairman and the minority member for their promptness in bringing this bill back to the fioor. While the exigencies of the situation preclude an amendment, I was happy to hear the chairman, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. IcHORD), say that he would be amendable to a compromise along the lines of the original section 612. I wonder if the gentleman from Vir- ginia, or possibly my friend, the gentle- man from Georgia (Mr. Brinkley) would want to talk to this: Martin R. Hoffman, Secretary of the Army, said re- cently in Massachusetts that the original O'Neill amendment was totally consist- ent with what the Army does now under the provisions of the National Environ- mental Protection Act. Despite the as.sur- ance of the Secretary of the AiTny, the President vetoed that particular section with which the Secretary of the Army said he had no difficulties. •T[ wonder if the distinguished gentle- man from Virginia would want to com- ment on what the chairman of the com- mittee has already spoken to at some August 2U, 1976 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE 27449 length on more than one occasion, namely, the possibility of some accom- modation along the lines of section 612 coming from the Senate. I would of course liked to have pro- posed my own compromise amendment on the House side, to insure that the House had some input into the amend- ment process. I was disturbed by the fact tha'-, the Military Construction Author- ization was brought up under the suspen- sion of the rules procedure. Under this procedure, no amendments may be added to the bill. I think it is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that the House will not get a chance to go on record for base closing legislation once again. As my colleagues know, the issue of military base closings or reductions has been contested within the framework of the Military Construction Authoriza- tion Act which we debate today. On May 7, 1976, the House agreed to an amendment which would have delayed any major base closings or reductions by 1 year from the date they were originally announced. In addition, the Secretary of Defense was required to submit a de- tailed justification for the base closings or reduction decision, together with the estimated fiscal, economic, budgetary, environmental, strategic and operational consequences of the action. Mr. Speaker, after this base closing amendment was included in the House version of H.R. 14846, it was also suc- cessfully inserted in the Senate version of the bill. The amendment then became part of the conference report and went to the President's desk for his signature. Shortly thereafter, the President vetoed the construction authorization and the bill was returned to the Congress. Al- though the President's veto was success- fully overridden in the House, the Sen- ate failed to muster the required two- thirds vote and the President's veto was sustained. This legislative history shows that the House is very much in favor of legislative provisions which deal with military base closings or reductions. The Members of this body want the Pentagon to deal with communities affected by base closings or reductions in a much more fair manner, giving them a chance to adjust to the tremendous unemployment and other impacts which are caused by Defense Department decisions. Up until now, little or no safeguards existed in this area, even when thousands of individuals lost their jobs in a region already hard pressed by unemployment. The House has approved this base clos- ing legislation on two separate occasions, showing that the original vote on May 7 was by no means a chance victory. On July 22, 1976, the House overwhelmingly expressed its approval of this legislation by a margin of 270 to 131, gaining even a two-thirds majority to override a Pres- idential veto. The House's will is clear here. While I am unhappy with the proce- dures being used today, I understand that tliis procedure will not preclude a com- promise amendment from being adopted in the final House-Senate conference. The Senate will shortly be voting on a compromise amendment dealing with the base closing issue which should satisfy the objections raised by the President to the original military construction au- thorization. Given the assurances which we have received today, I am confident that the House conferees will insure that the past legislative positions taken by the House on the base closing issue will be well represented in the final conference report. Mr. Speaker, I feel sure that a compro- mise can be worked out such that the Congress can overcome the objections of the President and still pass a meaning- ful base closing or reduction provision. Surely, in these times of high unemploy- ment it is not right for the Federal Gov- ernment to be the worst possible em- ployer, operating with little regard for the lives of citizens and their employ- ment opportunities when a major mili- tary facility is closed or greatly reduced in force. Mr. WHITEHURST. Mr. Speaker, I have no comment, but I understand the gentleman from Texas wants to talk about this, so let us wait until he gets the time. Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mi-. Brooks) , the chairman of the Committee on Government Opera- tions. Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished friend, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Ichord) for yielding. I want to say that I am not opposed to most of the provisions of this bill, but I do have some serious reservations about several provisions dealing with the au- thority to exchange Government-owned property. As chairman of the Committee on Government Operations, I have been In- creasingly aware of the abuses which oc- cur when Government agencies acquire new property through exchange. The Committee on Government Operations and the General Accounting Office have documented case after case where the exchange of properties has resulted in the failure of the Government to get the best value for its property, not to men- tion tlie acquisition of unneeded and un- authorized properties. The most objectionable feature of the exchange procedure is that it circum- vents the usual legislative process. It per- mits the agencies to bypass in most cases the authorization process and in all cases the appropriations process. One glaring example of this practice is the GSA's acquisition of a $20 million office build- ing in southern California which was never authorized by Congress, never ap- propriated for, and for which we have yet to identify a need. I recognize that the military construc- tion authorization bills have for many years contained general authority to ac- quire property by exchange. However, in this bill a new provision has been added which requires the Secretary of each of the services to certify in his report seek- ing to declare property excess to his department's needs that he has consid- ered the feasibility of exchanging such property for other real property and has determined that the property proposed to be declared excess is not suitable for exchange. This section would appear to encourage an aggressive use of the exchange au- thority by the military departments. I hope ^at is not the Intention of the gen- tleman from Missouri (Mr. Ichord) nor of the Committee on Armed Services which reported this bill. The Government presently has exten- sive statutory provisions dealing with the disposal of Government property. Section 203 of the Federal Property Act is in- tended to provide the Government with a uniform and equitable program that will enable the Government to receive the most overall benefit from its property in- vestments. I am sure the gentleman in- tends that disposals occurring as a result of the use of the exchange authority contained in the bill now under consid- eration should be consummated in full compliance with the provisions of the Federal Property Act, and I hope that it is not his intention or the committee's intention to bypass or abrogate the provi- sions of that law. The SPEAKER. The time of the gen- tleman from Texas (Mr. Brooks) has expired. Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self 5 minutes. Mr. Speaker, let me state to the dis- tinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brooks) that we are dealing with some very complicated provisions of the law. It was not my feeling nor was It the feel- ing of the members of the Committee on Armed Services that we were in any way in violation of the 1947 Federal Property Act nor were we in any way infringing upon the jurisdiction of the committee which the distinguished gentleman in the well chairs. I will state to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brooks) that what we were concerned about was this: During the calendar years 1974 and 1975 alone, the Department of Defense collectively re- ported as excess property to the General Services Administration 220,000 acres of improved real property at an acquisition cost of $687 million, without any of the proceeds except for family housing sales accruing to or benefiting the Depart- ment. In other words, I will state to the gentleman from Texas and the Members of the House that what we have been do- ing for several years is to operate another local revenue-sharing program through the use of Department of Defense funds. This is what we were concerned about; we were concerned with saving some money. We asked ourselves the question: How can we get an adequate defense for the United States as cheaply as we can? It was our feeling that we found too many cases where the Department of- De- fense has reported excess land to the GSA, and then the GSA has given it to some municipality or some State govern- ment, only to have the Department of Defense come back later and acquire land either nearby or in some other jurisdic- tion. It is our feeling that if the Depart- ment of Defense can exchange existing held land which it does not use for other land which It needs, that should be done In order to save some money. We have been able to work this out In many in- 27450 t le tt.e land t le ha' e n^ of govern: ng lani, Congr( ss t lan Sen ices an r mis stances, particularly in gram, where we are trying military airports from ian encroachments in nearly every Member of We are able to exchange easements and perhaps where needed with the further funds. Mr. Speaker, I would tleman from Texas (Mr. believe he is in error as changes are concerned. I tleman from Texas should matter, because it is true have the authority to without his committee or mittee specifically to be acquired. That is not true in the lands.

Mr. Speaker, I think mendous danger of fraud in of properties when we are different and uses that I think that the concep tleman from Missouri (Mr merit.

Mr. BROOKS. We will be glad to co- operate with the gentleman from Mis- souri. Mr. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ICHORD. I yield to the gentleman from Missouri. The SPEAKER. The time of the gen- tleman from Missouri (Mr. Ichord) has expired. Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self 1 additional minute, and I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Randall). Mr. RANDALL. Mr. Speaker, while the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brooks) re- mains Standing in the well, I wanted to express appreciation for his comments. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Activities of the Committee on Government Operations which the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brooks) headed for so long, I know that he is expressing a sincere and genuine con- cern with respect to exchange of prop- erties. I simply want to say that I appre- ciate the gentleman's concern and the caution he raises. As chairman of the subcommittee, many times interested Members have urged me to clear properties that were part of military installations, either by exchange or by sale. There is always a hurry and urgency to get some industry to locate on the property involved. Such property disposition is something upon which we must keep a close eye. Mr. Speaker, once again, I commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brooks) for his concern and expression of caution. Mr. MOAKLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the motion offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Ichord). The House has already passed a mili- tary construction authorization for fiscal year 1977 and I see no need for a second bill. The President chose to veto that bill (H.R. 12384) . I do not propose that the House now join in any rush to undo that mischief. The President objected to section 612 of the bill which was added as a floor amendment offered by the distinguished majority leader (Mr. O'Neill). The O'Neill amendment would have provided a 12-month period for review and jus- tification of proposed base closures or major reductions in staff at military installations. The O'Neill amendment fulfilled two vital purposes. It would have insured that Congress played a full and vigorous role in decisions which can have a major impact on the economic health of States and localities affected by base realine- ments. But of equal importance, even when Congress agrees with the justifica- tions for the proposal, the economic catastrophe would be delayed for 1 year. It would enable communities to spend a reasonable period of time working with the services, the Department of Defense, the Economic Development Administra- tion, and the General Services Adminis- tration in developing a sensible and eco- nomically viable reuse plan. It would enable the locality and the State to coor- dinate their efforts to attract new indus- try and insure a conversion to civilian reuse in the least disruptive manner possible. To accommodate major bases commu- nities make enormous sacrifices, gear many commimity services to meet the needs of base personnel and generally integrate the facility into the commu- nity's economy. All the O'Neill amend- ment asked was that these towns and cities be given 12 months before the ax falls and that Congress have an oppor- tunity to decide if there is any justifiable reason for the ax. I would suggest to my colleagues that my own experience with the closing of the Boston Naval Shipyard could strike any congressional district. In a period of months, a million dollars of economic activity and 6,000 jobs were gone. With- ont warning. Without reason. Boston has yet to recover from the enormous blow. Yet Massachusetts had deprived Richard Nixon of the honor no President since George Washington had attained — a unanimous vote of all the States in the electoral college. And so a political decision was made that Massachusetts would lose all its military bases. The last, Fort Devens, is now in the process of being closed. And it was indeed a political decision. At the height of the energy crisis, the Navy pushed ahead with the realine- ment that now forces ships to steam hundreds of extra miles to southern ports for overhaul and repairs. Some of the Navy's most experienced workers have been lost. And it lost the yard with the best record for on-time completions and the fewest cost overruns. The decisions are too important. They concern issues of national security and the economic health of our coimtry. We must not allow such decisions to be made by one man. The amendment has the clear support of the House. We passed the original bill by a substantial majority. The decisive vote on the vote on the override gave a clear message by a vote of 270 to 131. In the Senate, the override was supported by a constitutional majority — 51 — and a substantial majority of those voting. And now, Mr. Speaker, I propose that we wait. The President has vetoed the entire bill in order to keep vital economic decisions entirely in his own hands for the election campaign. I propose that we leave those hands empty. In no way does this infringe on the security of our Nation. Foreign military August 2J^, 1976 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE 27451 aid, civilian personnel and our fight- ing men, weapons research and procure- ment are all provided in other author- izing legislation. I urge my colleagues to reject this measure. There is no justification for this bill which represents a complete surrender by one branch of government to another. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on the bill presently under consideration. Tlie SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mis- souri? There was no objection. Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Speaker, I renew my recommendation that the rules be suspended and that this bill do pass. The SPEAKER. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Ichord) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill H.R. 14846, as amended. The question was taken; and (two- thirds having voted in favor thereof) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. TAX TREATMENT OF CEMETERY PERPETUAL CARE FUND TRUSTS Mr. ULLMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1142) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to provide for a distribu- tion deduction for certain cemetery perpetual care fund tmsts. The Clerk read as follows: Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, Tliat (a) section 642 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to special rules for credits and deductions of estates and trusts) Is amended by redesignating subsection (J) as subsection (k) and by adding after subsection (1) the following new subsection : "(J) Certain Distributions by Cemetert Perpetdal Care Funds. — In the case of a cemetery perpetual care fund which — "(1) was created pursuant to local law by a taxable cemetery corporation for the care and maintenance of cemetery property, and "(2) is treated for the taxable year as a trust for purposes of this subchapter, any amount distributed by such fund for the care and maintenance of gravesltes which have been purchased from the cemetery cor- poration before the beginning of the taxable year of the trust and with respect to which there is an obligation to furnish care and maintenance shall be considered to be a distribution solely for purposes of sections 651 and 661, but only to the extent that the aggregate amount so distributed during the taxable year does not exceed $5 multiplied by the aggregate number of such grave- sites.". (b) Effective Date. — The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply to amounts distributed during taxable years ending after December 31, 1963. The SPEAKER. Is a second demanded? Mr. FRENZEL. Mr. Speaker, I demand a second. The SPEAKER. Without objection, a second will be considered as ordered. There was no objection. The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Ullman) and the gentle- man from Minnesota (Mr. Frenzel) will be recognized for 20 minutes each. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Ullman). Mr. ULLMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the bill now before the House (H.R. 1142) permits cemetery per- petual care fimds to deduct the amounts they distribute for the care and main- tenance of gravesites. Under this provision, a "perpetual care fund" is a trust established under local law by a taxable cemetery for the care and maintenance of the cemetery. The deduction allowed is to be the amount actually distributed during the year for the care and maintenance of these grave- sites, but only under the following re- strictions : First. The deduction can be not more than $5 per gravesite; Second. The gravesite must have been sold before the beginning of the taxable year; Third. The gravesite must be one as to which the fund has an obligation to fur- nish care apd maintenance; and Fourth. The cemetery company has to actually spend the money for the care and maintenance of those gravesites. Also, the taxable cemetery companies that receive these distributions have to include these amounts as ordinary in- come. The position of the Internal Revenue Service has been that the deduction for income distributed by perpetual care funds is not allowable because these funds do not have any ascertainable beneficiaries. Since these distributions benefit gravesite owners, heirs, and the general public, the committee concluded that they were essentially the same as distributions to beneficiaries. Conse- quently, the committee recommended that these fimds be allowed the limited distribution deduction which I have just described. The bill is expected to reduce tax li- abilities by $10 million per year. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1142 straightens out an anomaly under present law. With the cooperation of the Treasury Department, the bill has been drafted with appropri- ate safeguards against abuse. I urge the House to give its approval to this bill. Mr. FRENZEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1142, which would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to provide a dis- tribution deduction in the case of cer- tain cemetery perpetual care fimd trusts. Under present law these funds are usually created as either irrevoca- ble trust under State law or xmder the bylaws and contracts of cemetery com- panies. Such trusts are funded out of the gross receipts from the sale of bur- ial lots and crypts, with the income of the trusts going to the care and main- tenance of the cemetery, the lots and the crypts. The Internal Revenue Serv- ice has taken the position that a trust established by a taxable cemetery would be subject to tax.

KANSAS' IMMUNITY FROM PESTS. Do our farmer friends ever compare their advantages with the opportunities of their eastern brethren? They certain ly do, for they are intelligent citizens, but we never relax our interest and often speak of them for the benefit of our distant readers. Just now a new pest has appeared in parts of the east that destroys the meadows and pastures; It is a small worm that feeds upon the grass. Only a few years ago such a pest appeared there that worked beneath the surface and ate the roots leaving above the surface a dead and dry mat, necessitating the plowing up of all fields where they appeared. Our prairies have never failed to produce an abundance of rich pasturage and liay. Another item by way of comparison: our meadows do not have to be top dressed with ex pensive fertilizers to get them started; hence we would not meet so great a loss as the eastern farmer even if visited by those pests. "With the exception of the grasshoppers one or two seasons several years ago Kansas farmers have never been seriously annoyed with insect pests in their crops. A VOLUME IN ONE SENTENCE. He who utters a great truth in one brief expression is like the great general who through one well planned move ment of his army brings victory to his cause and eternal fame to himself. But a single good thought born of greatness is a legacy to mankind, imperishable, and is greater than that which often fade3 away and is soon forgotten. As an illustration of what a volume can bo brought forth in a single utterance let us take Horace Greeley's advice of, "Go west, young man." How many have read these few words and followed im plicitly and confidently their simple yet valuable direction. What did the great commoner mean when he said this? His great mind had undoubtedly grasped the situation in thp over-crowded east, and beheld with equal clear ness the great undeveloped west, where the fullness of the earth knew no limitation, where boundless prairies rolled away in the magnificent distance, and where mountains with their treas ures of precious metals vied with the val ley s ncii and productive in soil, in pro viding labor and the promise of a just and liberal reward. But tickle the virgin soil and bounteous recognition of tho husbandman's skill springs forth; and let the miner strike deep his pick and drill into the towering cliff and the echo is heard in the great mints of the world. Horace Greely knew what untold wealth awaited development in the great west and directed the young man full of energy and brawn to come hither and seek a new home and certain reward. Ho came, and how many have found tho rich heritage of this good old man! How many have found both fame and fortune, while if they had remained in the east naught but a scanty existence would liave been the reward for incessant toil. No more fitting example of the effect of following this advice of the age can be found than in our glorious state and our own fair Wichita. Many of our leading men less than a score of years ago, left their eastern homes and friends to seek a new home and carve out for themselves a firm foothold in the numer ous field of business, aud success crown ed their efforts far beyond their most saungino expectations, and wealth and mitold luxury surround them, and they find boundless pleasure in a happy reality. To the young men of the east we say come west! Come to Wichita, and in beholding what a city can bo built in a few years, you but witness what can bo accomplished in a brief space of time by individual effort. Tho profuse display of confederate flags at Richmond on the occasion of tho dedication of tho Lee monument may liave been considered as evidence of a lack of wholehearted loyalty to the Union, but the action of those same people in raising 00,000 cash the same day towards completing tho proposed monument to General Grant in New York showed that their admiration for the grand hero of tho union cause has not abated one whit by lapse of time nor apparently adverse circumstances. The secretary of the state board of agriculture of Maine reports that the de cline in tho price of farming laud in that state has been fully 50 per cent dur ing the last twenty years, and 33 per cent of the shrinkage has taken place within tho past decade. At present there is no demand for farming land at any price. The same conditions are re ported to exist to an equal extent in sev eral eastern states. What has been their loss has been a relative gain to tho west. But nothing could be more natural. Self interest is the great mainspring to human action. THE NATIC AL GUARD. From Uvo K. C Star.

The first troops that reported at Washington in 18G1 were militia; the Eighth New York and the Sixth Massachusetts, the latter attacked by a mob during its march through Bal timore. The majority of soldiers who fought at the first battle of Bull Run were militaa, whoeo commanders in many instances afterwards became fa mous generals, and great numbers of its rank aud file wore "the stars" before tho war ended. By the militia the union was saved. Congress during Mr. Lincoln's admin istration passed u most comprehensive bill organizing the national guard, hence, since that time, very properly, our state troops are no longer called militia. It is alleged that the measure was inspired by William H. Seward, and of course the title was taken from the guarde nationale of France. Perhaps because of its foreign extraction the name has not been so generally adopted by the masses, nor has the organization re ceived that attention and care by the states that it merits. Certainly the representative companies camped in Kansas City today, are as fine looking and intelligent an assemblage of young men as are to be found anywhere; "whose manner and bearing show" that esprit du corps which characterizes the efficient soldier of any nation, and of whom any commonwealth may be justly proud. The states generally should be more lilerai in their appropriations for main taining our national guard, and keep it up to that standard where it properlv is a reflex of the military prestige of the country, and in case of trouble it mav be depeuded upon to promptly respond, as the old militia did so nobly in the na tion's emergency. SUNFLOWER There are between three and four hun dred Kansans in Paris at pressnt Paris, Texas. The state senators who have a vote in the senatorial velection next winter are feeling bigger every day now. A man by the name of Gerow has been mentioned in connection with the editor ial chair of the Atchison Champion. Yfednesday was the anniversary of the hanging of Oliphant at Topeka. Since then burglary there has never been what it was. Tho Atchison Globe informs the world that it is predicted that D. R. Anthony will be a resubmissionist before the close of the summer. The Second district will have its con gressional convention arranged for on the 17th. The Seventh district convention will he held on the 30th of next month. The Barb6r county farmers have passed resolutions refusing to support lawyer candidates for judge. Here is one case where the lawyers are at the wrong end of the "resolve." Jim Legate spends his time in Wash ington lobbying for the deep water project. He is paid $300 a month by the promoters of the scheme, and ho has a good time, says a paper that ought to know. There are storms on all sides of Kansas, terrific gales, floods and electrical disturb ances, yet Kansas has not been touched. Divine mercy probably regards the politi cal storm enough for the Sunflower al ready. Marion county suffers the blot of an En glish nobleman who will not permit the merchants to sell his tenants goods nor to purchase their produce until he has re ceived full rental. Let us thank heaven there is almost as few English noblemen in Kansas as there are nubbins. Congressman Perkins wants all of tho Republican farmers in his district to join the Farmers' Aliiance so that it may be governed by wite and patriotic counsels and be kept out of politics. IMr. Perkins probably feels, however, that if they must go into politics, he could point out to them the man who should have their support. "We know of a straDge coincidence. Some three years ago a man from Clinton, Ken., named Graham moved with his family to Kingman county, ne did not dwell in Kansas satisfactorily, because of an in ordinate dread of cyclones on his wife's part and her dislike for the state because of its reputation in that way. His eldest daughter, besides, during his residence in the state was in continual apprehension of being scalped by the Indians for which misfortune she had a special dread. Mother and daughter by their dissatisfaction final ly prevailed on Graham to return to his old home in Kentucky. This was about a year ago. Six months ago the town of Clinton was struck by a cyclone, the Graham house was completely demolished, and Mrs. Graham met her death in the very way she had left Kansas to avoid, and the still stranger part was that a fly ing timber struck the daughter and sever ed her scalp. The daughter recovered but is disfigured. Graham himself was hurt and is still prostrate. The alumni catalogue of the State Uni versity, just issued, gives the whole num ber of graduates at 233, of whom 14U are men and 87 are women. Of these, 04 of the men aud 42 of the women are mrrried. Of degrees there are: Bachelors of arts, 1?9; bachelors of science, 59; bachelors of didactics, 19; bachelors of civil engineer ing, 8; doctors of science, 1; doctors of phi losophy, 1; of these the number counted twice is 21. Their residences are distri buted as follows: Kansas, 142; Missouri, 13; Colorado, S; Washington, G; District of Columbia, 9; Texas, 5; Illinois, 5; Penn sylvania, 4; Indian territory, 4; California, Indiana, New York, Montana aud Ne braska, 3 each; New Mexico, Utah, Massa chusetts and Ohio, 2 each; and Arizona, Michigan, Maryland, Mexico and China, 1 each. Six only are on the roll, of the dead. As to occupations they are distributed as follows: Teachers, oj; lawyers, 32; civil engineers, 17; journalists, 10; ministers, 10; students, 1G; physicians, S; merchants, G; farmers, G; mi-cellaneous, 25. Of these 12 were counted twice. TO PENSIONERS. Dear Sir: A letter from the com missioner of pensions informs me that no additional fund can be given to those now on hand, until after July 1, the be ginning of the next fiscal year. We shall begin the pavment on Wednes day, June 4, with about $1,000,000. Af ter five days the funds will be exhausted. Pensioners can send in their vouchers, but it Avill bo useless for them to write letters, as we will send out the checks as soon as we have money. No originals or increases can be paid until the new ap propriation is available. Pensioners can execute the voucher and forward it to this agency, where it will be placed on file, and payment made as soon as funds are received. Further correspondence is unnecessary. Will papers over this district please copy and oblige, B. Kelly. NEWSPAPER WORK. From tho Omaha Republican, Once a newspaper man always a news paper man. First Assistant Postmaster General Clarkson is another illustration of this truism. Only a few months have intervened since he was grinding away at the editorial de-k, yet he is already lired of official life aud yearning for journalistio work once more. Why is it that newspaper toil is so attractive? Why is it that after one enters the service one never wishes to leave it? It is not be cause the work is light, for newspaper men work longer hours than any other class of toilers. And it is not because of the compensation, for heaven knows they are paid little enough. That which holds men in the service is something altogether different from these things. It is sentiment and love of work. No man can render efficient service unless he likes his employment, aud the love which the writer for the press bears to ward his mistress and her service is more than love. It is devotion. A man does not adopt journalism simply as a means of livihood; but because his incli nation and tastes draw him in that direction. He feels that he is specially fitted for news)aper work, and when he once takes up the pencil he never wants to lay it down: There is a mysterious inspiration and fascination about the work, and he who adopts the profession throws his whole soul into it. If there is any enthusiasm in a man it manifests itself at once. His task, though often heavy, is a pleasure. He is at once interested, zealous, enthusiastic. Though the pay may be small and his hours long he is never discouraged and never wearies. He has taken the oath of al legiance and he stands by his colors through thick and thin. His service is a life service, and. notwithstanding the drudgery, the newspaper man is nearly always light-hearted and lmppy. Noth ing troubles him. It is difficult to explain just whenn the fascination lies. Ask one of the toil ers one who works while other men sleep, whose life is literally given up to his business why lie doesn't seek easier and pleasanter employment. He will tell you, simply, that he is contented that he likes . the work. And herein must be the secret Why he likes it lie is seiuom aoie to ten you. A newsDavJ per man's life is full of variety and ac tivity. Every day brings something en tirely different and new, and awakens new thoughts and new ideas. It is full of responsibilities and cares, and each toiler has the consciousness that he has a distinct and important place to fill that his work is necessary and valuable. All of these things tend to keep up interest and enthusiasm. And then the fact that he can see his finished work before him each day is of itself an inspiration and an incentive to redoubled efforts. If his work is meritorious he is commended. His ambition is aroused and he strives to accomplish loftier and higher tilings. The journalist stands on an elevation and watches and records the doings of others. After being a spectator and a critic he dislikes to get down from his perch and be lost in the surging mass. THE SILVER QUESTION. Anent the current discussion of tho silver question, a question that occupies so prominent a place in the public esti mation; and further, the popular demand for some decisive legislation by congress in line with the requirements of the times from the point of view of the gen eral and pressing needs of the business of the country; and still further, in view of the popular favor with which the bill in troduced in the senate a few days ago by Mr. Plumb, know as the St. John bill, the following statement of the situation prepared by the author of the bill, at the suggestion of the New York Chamber of Commerce, will be read with interest and will help to a more compre hensive understanding of the question and its involvings as to the money ques tion and the goverment's obligation and duty in the premises: 'Nations trade with commodities, and only in a balance of trade is title acquir ed to gold and silver, esteemed as money. H Europe in any season shall establish a balance of trade against the United States, which others of commodities will not acceptably make good to her, she may exercise her right to command our gold, uninfluenced by this proposed en actment or any other act of ours respecting silver. On tho other hand, as from time to time the foreigner shall establish a title to a por tion of our gold, it will be of prime con cern to us that we have provided a suffi ciency of money acceptable as legal ten der hero and abundant for our wants in our vast domestic trade. Twelve million increase of population and the creation of four new states indicate domestic trade expansion in the last ten years. The act proposed, being in result the same as though we opened our mints to free coinage of the standard dollar, will enhance the price of silver and maintain it at parity with our mint fixed price in all the markets of tho world. British India's mints are open to her legal ten der rupees upon the payment of her seigniorage charge of 2 per cent. There fore, to enhance the price of silver in all markets is by so much to increase the cost in gold to Europe of the commodi ties which, in the balance of trade, In dia's money buys. Thus to add about o0 per cent to the gold cost in Europe of India's legal tender rupees is, to some portion of that 30 per cent, to enhance the price at which Europe can profit ably receive and pay for United States supplies of products now supplied by India. What this may mean may bo surmised from the fact that India last year exported 32,000,000 worth of wheat as against our exjxtrt of 44,000,000 worth of the same. There fore the proposed enhancement of the price of silver will tend to increase our exports and establish for us a credit bal ance in trade with Europe; and therefore tend to establish for us a title to Europe's gold. "The perilous inadequacy of new gold supplies, if gold alone is to be relied upon as the world single full tender money, ought to be evident from the fact that all nations have supplemented their total volume of both gold and silver money with paper issues additional. Tho world's annual production of gold aver ages about 101,000,000, and the annual coining and recoining of gold averages S140,000,000. Yet tho world's art-use of gold, absorbing over 70,000,000, leaves less than 30,000,000, annually as the sum of new gold from the mines appli cable to the world s increase of money. France, conspicuous among nations for her shrewdness in finance, has a total sum of money exceeding 2,030 million dollars, or 500 million dollars more than our to tal sum of money afloat, in bank and in the treasury of the United States, and this for use of 27,000,000 fewer than we count, and all embraced in a territory lets than one-sixteenth the area of the United States. France lias 270,000,000 more gold than wo have, 100,000,000 more paper money and 230,000,000 more of silver. Yet France is the natural ac cumulator of tho dear gold of other na tions, she importing last year (to Febru ary 1S90) a total net sum of gold exceed ing 30.000.000. "With China absorbing about half of Mexico's silver almost as rapidly as corned; with India still greedy to in crease her hoard of treasure "gold and silver'' upon an accumulation during tho last forty-six years already exceeding in value 2,070,000,000 made up in part bv silver imports in 18S7 26,000,000, 18SS 29,000,000.000, 1S9 40,000,OOo; with South America also frequentlv a buyer last year; with the United States last year consuming for coinage about one half the silver proposed in this enact ment, it may astonish some to learn that after the year's production (Calendar 1S89), the greatest of any single year in the world's whole history, tho great dis tributing silver markets, London, New York, and San Fjancisco, being asked in February last to state their supplies of silver quoted, ''stocks of silver nominal.'' "The weight of pure silver contained in our present standard coin is the same as that prescribes for our dollar of 1 1 92, the free coinage of which continued to be allowed until 1S73. That this old privilege of free coinage was much neg lected was due to Europe's over-valuing of silver, compared with gold, by which Europe's mints were a better market for our silver than our own. The closing of our own and Luropes mints to silver and subsequent only partial reopening of ours, while all tho time all mints havo been open to gold, has increased the purchasing power of gold unquestiona bly. And tne inference is fair that if without any better treatment of silver by the worid than now.the world's mints were closed to gold, the annual excess of about S2S,000,000 of gold production more than the arts consume would scon depress the price of gold, measured in silver, to a point where gold would be cheap enough for a greatly extended use in industries."' Perplexities of the 'Phone. From Ui? New Yerlfc Star. A business like woman to whom a friend in New York was showing the wonders of long distance telephoning the other day. was asked whom she would liave called up in Philadelphia, and she promptly named the shop of the postmaster-general. In due rime a reply was received, awl the lady, being asked "what she had to communicate, asked with un mistakable earnestness whether she could match a piece of black mohair bought of the P. M. G. more tliau a year ago. The polite but astonished at tendant answered that he would see," but at last accounts he had cot "seen." STAY IN KANSAS. From the Wallace County Gazette. A three weeks' visit to the much ad vertised northwest has entirely cured us of a desire to change our location to either Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon, or even the much over rated Puget Sound country. Neither of the places above montioned can compare in the slightest particular with western Kansas. The people in Washington and Oregon are wild with the real estate speculation fever. In the Puget Sound country ev ery five acre tract has been made a town site, but no surrounding country to back it. In every case eastern investors have been made victims. They have been let in on the "ground floor" only to be drop ped into the cellar. In western Washington, in your effort to clear a farm of its timber and rubbish, after twenty years of hard work you will have only ten acres cleared and a broken back for your trouble. The towns are all overdone and idle laboring men is the rule. In Wyoming and Idaho the plains are dotted with dead and putrid cattle, owing to the long, pro tracted and severe winters and scarcity of feed. Stay right here. You are a thousand times better off than the peo ple of the northwest. OKLAHOMA OUTLINES. How is the Guthrie and Reno railroad getting along? A Payne man claims to have the best spring in Oklahoma. Many of the Oklahoma papers are pub lishing the "herd law." The Territorial Advocate wants its coun ty to be called "Beaver." During this little lull, let us take time to ask how Frank Gillette is getting along. The Frisco Herald didn't die as was re ported it would do, but is looking better than ever. Sid Clarke is down in Oklahoma. There are few people in Oklahoma who do not know this. The young people of Beaver have a lawn tennis club. Beaver isn't so much "west" as it used to be. Fall City is not a very big town, but it is growing. It has two store, one black smith shop and drug store. At Hennessey tho summer strawberry and ice cream social has taken the place of the dance and the oyster supper. There is not half the number of men in Oklahoma who wear their pantaloons in boots that there was a year ago. The Kingfisher Journal has formally an nounced that it is a Republican paper and that it will stand by Republicans. It does look "powerfully" like four, at least, of the seven of town site boards will be filled by outside appointments. The governor's private secretary has one distinction over tho territorial officers. He has a "professor" before his name. Some of the Oklahoma schools are just closing. They have held out pretty well. Next year Oklahoma will havo graduates. A preacher of the territory bears the name of Breedlove. It must be hard to live up to a name like this in the territory among tho present multitude of candi dates. The flag carried before the procession it Kingfisher, Decoration Day, belonged to "Jake" Admire and was carried at the head of Captain Admire's company dur ing the war. The statutes of Arkansas are now in full operation in the Indian territory, and Judge Shackleford has within a week past, assessed several fines for their viola tion. Tho disturbers of the peace seem to be the most numerous before the bar of justice. Tho way the town of Alfred happened to have its name changed is explained: Zack Mulhall, a Cherokee strip cattleman, had a contest on the townsite, but offered to withdraw it if in consideration the town changed its name to "Mulhall" and he be given a certain number of lots. Oklahoma City Journal: The coat, of arms for Oklahoma shonld represent the white man and the red man clasping hands. Heretofore it has been uuial to represent the red man retreating with the advance of civilization, but here in Okla homa the races will mingle, and will soon be found working together for the up building of a great state. In the local columns of the Democrat to day is published the touching story of Louis Tesson, once the chief of the rem nant of the tribe of Iowa Indians, whose reservation is in Brown county, Kansas. If we understand Tesson 's case rightly, he is a patriot among patriots. He believes that tor his tribe to part with their lands means early extinction of tho tribe. In tho heat of a controversy upon this sub ject ten years ago he is accused of having slain another chief who favored allotment in severalty and the sale of the balance of the reservation. For ten years Tesson lias been a fugitive from justice. Away off, in the wilds of Cnnada, he hears that a new chief has been elected and that nego tiations for the sale of the Iowa reserva tion have been reopened. Still strong in the belief that this means the ruin of his people ho returns and surrenders himself to the federal authorities, stipulating that he shall be released on bonds lone: enough to once more lift up his voicein tho councils of his nation tagainst the measure he formerly condemned. For the sake of preventing the lowas from following a suicidal policy, Louis Tesson is willing to risk his life and is going to do so. If there is loyalty greater than this it has not been recorded. It approaches the sublime de votion of tho humble Nazarine himself. The one tho act of the Son of God, tho other that of an untutored savage. Topeka Democrat. EXCHANGE SHOTS. A Fortunate State. From the Atchison Globe. Heaven is very kind to Kansas. It rains at the right time, and when it doesn't rain it showers down meteors on Kansas farms that sell for a 1 ,000 apiece. Slightly Incomjruvial. From Emporia Republican. Kansas people may not like to answer all the census questions but they do not throw beer glasses at the enumerators like New York people do. Kansas has no beer glasses. The World's Population. The Mongolians lead with about 630, 000.000, and the Aryans, which com prise practically all the peopleof Europe; four-thfths of those of the American con tinent and all of the civilized residents of Australia, come next, with 545.000,000. The negroes are put at 350,000,000, the Semitic people at 65,000,000. the Malays and Polynesians at 35,000,000, and the Indians of North and South America at 15,000,000. Hot Like I From the Arkaatas City Traveler. The stereotyped remark of the Kansas City Times that "the outlook for the Democrats in Kansas is more promising than ever before'" reminds us of the Kansas attorney who. having labored long and faithfully to collect a bill, re turned the statement to his client with the quotation, "Your debtor k the most promising man of my acquaintance.

Article: In some examples, the graph 400 shown in FIG. 4 may be an LDPC graph having dimensions less than that necessary to produce the minimum codeword length utilized in a wireless communication network (e.g., the radio access network 100 shown in FIG. 1). A group of related LDPC graphs may be represented by one of the related LDPC graphs, which may be referred to herein as an “LDPC base graph.” For example, an LDPC base graph may be representative of those LDPC graphs having a number of bit nodes K_(b) (columns in the matrix) within a particular range of bit node numbers (e.g., x<=K_(b)<=y, where x and y define the minimum and maximum number of bit nodes within the group of related LDPC graphs). In some example, the LDPC base graph is the LDPC graph having the maximum number of bit nodes within the group of related LDPC graphs.
To produce an LDPC graph corresponding to a desired information block length K and code rate R, each of the entries in the LDPC matrix representing the LDPC graph may be lifted (e.g., replaced with another matrix) by a lift size Z (e.g., K_(b)*Z=K). For example, if the LDPC graph is represented by a 3×3 matrix and a lift size Z of three is applied to the LDPC graph, the resulting lifted matrix is a 9×9 matrix. In effect, lifting is a technique for generating a relatively large LDPC code from multiple copies of a smaller code. The largest lift size Z_(max) represents the largest degree of parallelism that may be achieved per edge in the LDPC graph, corresponding to the largest information block length K_(max) for an LDPC graph.
 The decoder may be implemented to calculate at least one group of P edge messages in parallel. In some examples, the value of P is equal to or greater than the level of parallelism required to reach peak throughput. For example, P may be equal to the largest lift size Z_(max) that is used in the peak throughput case. In one example, to achieve a maximum information block length (K_(max)) of 8192 bits, the corresponding maximum lift size (Z_(max)), and thus, degree of parallelism P, may be equal to 320 to achieve a peak throughput of 20 Gb/s. However, when the lift size Z is less than P, some of the decoding hardware resources may be idle and not utilized. For example, as K, and in turn, the lift size Z, become smaller, decoder resource utilization efficiency and throughput may decrease.
In various aspects of the disclosure, two or more LDPC base graphs may be designed, each having a different range of graph dimensions (e.g., different ranges of numbers of bit nodes) to improve decoder resource utilization at smaller values of K. Therefore, each LDPC base graph may support a different information block length range (e.g., K_(low) to K_(high)). In addition, each information block length range may overlap.
 In some examples, a baseline LDPC base graph may be designed to cover all or a large portion of information block lengths and code rates utilized in a wireless communication network. The baseline LDPC base graph may then set the largest information block length K_(max) and largest lift size Z_(max) for the encoder and decoder. One or more additional LDPC base graphs may further be designed to cover one or more subsets of the information block lengths and code rates. In some examples, the additional LDPC base graphs may overlap with the baseline LDPC base graph, but may also cover other information block lengths outside of the information block length range covered by the baseline LDPC base graph. For example, at least one of the LDPC base graphs may include lower information block lengths than those included in the information block length range associated with the baseline LDPC base graph.
In some examples, each of the additional LDPC base graphs supports all of the same code rates as the baseline LDPC base graph. In other examples, one or more of the additional LDPC base graphs may support a subset of the code rates or one or more different code rates. For example, based on a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) table, the code rates supported by an additional LDPC base graph may include those code rates immediately above and below a modulation order transition (e.g., from 16QAM to 32 QAM). One or more of the additional LDPC base graphs may, therefore, utilize the maximum lift size Z_(max) at smaller values of K (K<K_(max)). Additional LDPC base graphs may further be designed for other performance benefits. For example, an additional LDPC base graph may be designed to support lower code rates relative to other LDPC base graphs.
 In some examples, for an information block of a length K at a given code rate R, an encoder or decoder may select the particular LDPC base graph that maximizes the lift size Z, where Z<=Z_(max). For example, the encoder or decoder may select a first LDPC base graph when a first lift size applied to the first LDPC base graph to produce the information block length is greater than a second lift size applied to a second LDPC base graph to produce the information block length. Similarly, the encoder or decoder may select the second LDPC base graph when the second lift size applied to the first LDPC base graph to produce the information block length is greater than the first lift size applied to a second LDPC base graph to produce the information block length. The first LDPC base graph may correspond, in some examples, to the baseline LDPC base graph, while the second LDPC base graph may correspond to a lower LDPC base graph (e.g., an LDPC base graph including a fewer number of bit nodes).
 In some examples, the encoder or decoder may select a particular LDPC graph based on a parallelism constraint at the receiver. Thus, the particular LDPC base graph may be selected based on the information block length K and the parallelism constraint P of the decoder, where P=Z_(max) (e.g., the parallelism constraint sets the maximum lift size). For example, assuming a smallest information block size K at a given rate R supported by multiple LDPC base graphs, the encoder or decoder may select the LDPC base graph that provides the largest lift size Z. As K increases, the encoder or decoder may continue to select the same LDPC base graph while the lift size is less than or equal to the parallelism constraint P. However, at the information block length K where the current LDPC base graphs lift size Z exceeds P, the encoder or decoder may switch to the LDPC base graph that provides the largest lift size Z that is less than or equal to P. This process may be repeated until the maximum information block length K_(max) is reached.
As an example, assume there are three LDPC base graphs, low LDPC base graph (8<=K_(b)<=10), middle LDPC base graph (16<=K_(b)<=20), and high LDPC base graph (24<=K_(b)<=30). With a parallelism constraint or maximum lift size of 320 and a code rate of 1/3, for K<=3200, an LDPC base graph from the low LDPC base graph may be selected, for 3200<K<=6400, an LDPC base graph from the middle LDPC base graph may be selected, and for 6400<K<=8192 (K_(max)), an LDPC base graph from the high LDPC base graph may be selected.
 In some examples, an LDPC base graph that does not provide the largest lift size may be selected to improve other factors, such as performance In addition, metrics other than the lift size may be used to select the LDPC base graph. For example, the decoding speed may be used to select the LDPC base graph (e.g., the LDPC base graph providing the highest decoding speed that is less than the peak throughput achieved at the parallelism constraint P may be selected).
FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless communication device 500 configured to select between two or more LDPC base graphs according to some aspects of the present disclosure. In FIG. 5, prior to encoding an information block, the code rate (CR) 502 and information block length (IBL) 504 of the information block may be provided to LDPC base selection circuitry 506. The LDPC base selection circuitry 506 may then select from two or more LDPC base graphs 508, each having a different range of graph dimensions (e.g., different ranges of numbers of bit nodes). Thus, each LDPC base graph 508 may support a different information block length range (e.g., K_(low) to K_(high)). In addition, each information block length range supported by the respective LDPC base graphs 508 may overlap. In some examples, each of the LDPC base graphs 508 are predetermined and loaded into the wireless communication device 500 prior to deployment of the wireless communication device 500.
 In some examples, one of the LDPC base graphs 508 may be a baseline LDPC base graph that is designed to cover all or a large portion of information block lengths and code rates utilized in a wireless communication network. For example, the baseline LDPC base graph may set the largest information block length K_(max) and largest lift size Z_(max) for the encoder and decoder. Other LDPC base graphs 508 may be designed to cover one or more subsets of the information block lengths and code rates. In some examples, each of the other LDPC base graphs may overlap with the baseline LDPC base graph, but may also cover other information block lengths outside of the information block length range covered by the baseline LDPC base graph. For example, at least one of the LDPC base graphs 508 may be able to produce lower information block lengths than those produced by the baseline LDPC base graph.
The LDPC base graph selection circuitry 506 may initially compare the IBL 504 of the information block with the information block length ranges supported by each of the LDPC base graphs 508. If only one of the LDPC base graphs 508 supports the IBL 504 of the information block, the LDPC base graph selection circuitry 506 may select the single LDPC base graph 508 that supports the IBL 504. However, if more than one LDPC base graph 508 supports the IBL 504 of the information block, the LDPC base graph selection circuitry 506 may utilize other metrics to select an LDPC base graph 508 for the information block.
 In some examples, if more than one LDPC base graph 508 supports the IBL 504, the LDPC base graph selection circuitry 506 may consider the CR 502 that may be utilized to encode the information block to select the LDPC base graph 508. For example, each LDPC base graph may support a respective code rate range. In examples where one of the LDPC base graphs 508 is a baseline LDPC base graph, the baseline LDPC base graph may support all or a large portion of the code rates utilized in a wireless communication network. Other LDPC base graphs 508 may support a subset of the code rate range of the baseline LDPC base graph and/or different code rates. Thus, each LDPC base graph may support a different code rate range. If the CR 502 to be utilized for the information block is only supported by one of the LDPC base graphs, the LDPC base graph selection circuitry 506 may select the LDPC base graph 508 that supports the CR 502.
 However, if more than one LDPC base graph 508 supports the CR 502, the LDPC base graph selection circuitry 506 may select the LDPC base graph based on the respective lift size to be applied to each LDPC base graph 508 to produce the IBL 504 of the information block 504. In some examples, the LDPC base graph selection circuitry 506 may select the LDPC base graph 508 that provides the largest lift size to produce the IBL 504. For example, considering two LDPC base graphs (e.g., a first LDPC base graph and a second LDPC base graph), the LDPC base graph selection circuitry 506 may select the first LDPC base graph when the lift size applied to the first LDPC base graph to produce the IBL 504 is greater than the lift size applied to the second LDPC base graph to produce the IBL 504, and vice-versa.
 The selected LDPC base graph 508 may then be input to LDPC graph selection circuitry 510 to select a particular LDPC graph 512 for use in encoding the information block. In certain circumstances, each LDPC base graph 508 may represent a set of two or more LDPC graphs 512. In some examples, the LDPC base graphs 508 represent a group of related LDPC graphs 512 having a number of bit nodes K_(b) (columns in the matrix shown in FIG. 3) within a particular range of bit node numbers (e.g., x<=K_(b)<=y, where x and y define the minimum and maximum number of bit nodes within the group of related LDPC graphs). In some example, each LDPC base graph 508 corresponds to the LDPC graph 512 having the maximum number of bit nodes within the group of related LDPC graphs 512. The LDPC graph selection circuitry 510 may select one of the LDPC graphs 512, which may be the LDPC base graph 508, within the group of related LDPC graphs 512 for use in encoding the information block. The particular LDPC graph 512 may be selected based on, for example, the CR 502, IBL 504, lift size, or other factors that may be related to the performance of the encoder and/or decoder.
FIG. 6 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of a hardware implementation for an exemplary wireless communication device 600 employing a processing system 614. For example, the wireless communication device 600 may be a user equipment (UE), a base station, or any other suitable apparatus or means for wireless communication.
 The wireless communication device 600 may be implemented with a processing system 614 that includes one or more processors 604. Examples of processors 604 include microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), state machines, gated logic, discrete hardware circuits, and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. In various examples, the wireless communication device 600 may be configured to perform any one or more of the functions described herein. That is, the processor 604, as utilized in a wireless communication device 600, may be used to implement any one or more of the processes described and illustrated in FIGS. 7-9.
 In this example, the processing system 614 may be implemented with a bus architecture, represented generally by the bus 602. The bus 602 may include any number of interconnecting buses and bridges depending on the specific application of the processing system 614 and the overall design constraints. The bus 602 communicatively couples together various circuits including one or more processors (represented generally by the processor 604), a memory 605, and computer-readable media (represented generally by the computer-readable medium 606). The bus 602 may also link various other circuits such as timing sources, peripherals, voltage regulators, and power management circuits, which are well known in the art, and therefore, will not be described any further. A bus interface 608 provides an interface between the bus 602 and a transceiver 610. The transceiver 610 provides a means for communicating with various other apparatus over a transmission medium (e.g., air). Depending upon the nature of the apparatus, an optional user interface 612 (e.g., keypad, display, speaker, microphone, joystick) may also be provided. It should be understood that the user interface 612 may not be provided in some devices, such as a base station.
The processor 604 is responsible for managing the bus 602 and general processing, including the execution of software stored on the computer-readable medium 606. The software, when executed by the processor 604, causes the processing system 614 to perform the various functions described below for any particular apparatus. The computer-readable medium 606 and the memory 605 may also be used for storing data that is manipulated by the processor 604 when executing software.
 One or more processors 604 in the processing system may execute software. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, instruction sets, code, code segments, program code, programs, subprograms, software modules, applications, software applications, software packages, routines, subroutines, objects, executables, threads of execution, procedures, functions, etc., whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise. The software may reside on a computer-readable medium 606. The computer-readable medium 606 may be a non-transitory computer-readable medium. A non-transitory computer-readable medium includes, by way of example, a magnetic storage device (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strip), an optical disk (e.g., a compact disc (CD) or a digital versatile disc (DVD)), a smart card, a flash memory device (e.g., a card, a stick, or a key drive), a random access memory (RAM), a read only memory (ROM), a programmable ROM (PROM), an erasable PROM (EPROM), an electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), a register, a removable disk, and any other suitable medium for storing software and/or instructions that may be accessed and read by a computer. The computer-readable medium may also include, by way of example, a carrier wave, a transmission line, and any other suitable medium for transmitting software and/or instructions that may be accessed and read by a computer.
The computer-readable medium 606 may reside in the processing system 614, external to the processing system 614, or distributed across multiple entities including the processing system 614. The computer-readable medium 606 may be embodied in a computer program product. By way of example, a computer program product may include a computer-readable medium in packaging materials. Those skilled in the art will recognize how best to implement the described functionality presented throughout this disclosure depending on the particular application and the overall design constraints imposed on the overall system.
 In some aspects of the disclosure, the processor 604 may include circuitry configured for various functions. For example, the processor 604 may include low density parity check (LDPC) encoding circuitry 642 configured to receive an information block of a given block length and to encode the information block using LDPC encoding based on a particular code rate. In some examples, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may be configured to select an LDPC base graph from a plurality of LDPC base graphs 615 maintained, for example, in memory 605. The LDPC base graphs 615 may correspond to the LDPC base graphs 508 shown in FIG. 5. In addition, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may include the LDPC base graph selection circuitry 506 and LDPC graph selection circuitry 510 shown in FIG. 5. The LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may then select a particular LDPC graph represented by the LDPC base graph and utilize the selected LDPC graph to encode the information block to produce a codeword for transmission over a wireless air interface to a receiving wireless communication device via the transceiver 610. The codeword contains the information bits of the information block and parity check bits generated using the selected LDPC graph.
 In some examples, the LDPC base graphs 615 may be designed for the wireless communication network over which the wireless communication device communicates and stored within memory 605. The LDPC base graphs 615 may include, for example, two or more LDPC base graphs, each associated with a different information block range. For example, the LDPC base graphs 615 may include a first LDPC base graph associated with a first information block length range and a second LDPC base graph associated with a second information block length range. The first information block length range may cover, for example, a baseline information block length range supported by the wireless communication network (e.g., between 100 and 8192 bits). The second information block length range may contain a subset of the first information block length range such that the second information block length is contained completely within the first information block length range (e.g., between 100 and 3200 bits) or overlaps the first information block length range (e.g., between 50 and 3200 bits). Additional LDPC base graphs 615 may also be designed and maintained in memory 605. For example, a third LDPC base graph may be designed to be associated with a third information block length range. The third information block length range may also contain a subset of the first information block length range such that the third information block length range is contained completely within the first information block length range (e.g., between 100 and 6400 bits) or overlaps the first and second information block length ranges (e.g., between 75 and 6400 bits).
 The LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may further be configured to select the LDPC base graph from the plurality of LDPC base graphs 615 for encoding the information block based on the information block length of the information block. In some examples, if only one of the LDPC base graphs 615 supports the information block length of the information block, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may select the single LDPC base graph 615 that supports the information block length. However, if more than one LDPC base graph 615 supports the information block length of the information block, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may utilize other metrics to select an LDPC base graph 615 for the information block. Examples of other metrics include, but are not limited to, the code rate and the lift size.
 In some examples, each of the LDPC base graphs 615 covers all possible code rates that may be used in the wireless communication network. In this example, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may select the LDPC base graph 615 that utilizes the highest lift size to produce the information block length of the information block. In other examples, one or more of the LDPC base graphs 615 may cover a different code rate range than other LDPC base graphs. For example, the first LDPC base graph may be associated with a first code rate range, while the second LDPC base graph may be associated with a second code rate range that overlaps the first code rate range, but also includes other code rates not within the first code rate range. In this example, if only one of the LDPC base graphs 615 supports the code rate of the information block, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may select the single LDPC base graph 615 that supports the code rate. However, if more than one LDPC base graph 615 supports the code rate of the information block, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may select the LDPC base graph 615 that utilizes the highest lift size to produce the information block length of the information block.
 In some examples, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may further consider a parallelism constraint at the receiving wireless communication device when selecting the LDPC base graph 615. The parallelism constraint indicates the maximum number of edge messages that may be processed in parallel by the receiving wireless communication device. In some examples, the parallelism constraint is equal to or greater than the level of parallelism required to reach peak throughput. For example, the parallelism constraint may be equal to the largest lift size that is used in the peak throughput case. In one example, to achieve a maximum information block length of 8192 bits, the corresponding maximum lift size, and thus, degree of parallelism, may be equal to 320 to achieve a peak throughput of 20 Gb/s. In other examples, the parallelism constraint may be less than the level of parallelism required to reach peak throughput.
Using the above example of three LDPC base graphs, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may select the second LDPC base graph when the lift size applied to the second LDPC base graph to produce the information block length of the information block to be encoded is less than or equal to the parallelism constraint. The LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may further select the third LDPC base graph when the lift size applied to the second LDPC base graph to produce the information block length is greater than the parallelism constraint and the lift size applied to the third LDPC base graph to produce the information block length is less than or equal to the parallelism constraint. The LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may further select the first LDPC base graph when the lift size applied to the third LDPC base graph to produce the information block length is greater than the parallelism constraint.
 In some examples, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may select the LDPC base graph based on factors other than the information block length, code rate, and/or lift size. For example, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may select the LDPC base graph based on the decoding speed expected at the receiving wireless communication device for each LDPC base graph (e.g., the LDPC base graph providing the highest decoding speed that is less than the peak throughput achieved at the parallelism constraint may be selected). The LDPC encoding circuitry 642 may operate in coordination with LDPC encoding software 652.
The processor 604 may further include LDPC decoding circuitry 644 configured to receive a codeword over a wireless air interface from a transmitting wireless communication device via the transceiver 610 and decode the codeword utilizing LDPC decoding to produce an information block of a given block length. In some examples, the LDPC decoding circuitry 644 may be configured to select an LDPC base graph from a plurality of LDPC base graphs 615 maintained, for example, in memory 605. The LDPC decoding circuitry 644 may then select an LDPC graph represented by the LDPC base graph and utilize the selected LDPC graph to decode the codeword to produce the information block. The LDPC decoding circuitry 644 may select the LDPC base graph for decoding of the codeword based on at least the information block length of the information block. The LDPC decoding circuitry 644 may further utilize the code rate, lift size, the parallelism constraint of the LDPC decoding circuitry 644, and/or other metrics to select the LDPC base graph. The LDPC decoding circuitry 644 may operate in coordination with LDPC decoding software 654.
 FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process 700 for low density parity check (LDPC) encoding in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure. As described below, some or all illustrated features may be omitted in a particular implementation within the scope of the present disclosure, and some illustrated features may not be required for implementation of all embodiments. In some examples, the process 700 may be carried out by the wireless communication device illustrated in FIG. 6. In some examples, the process 700 may be carried out by any suitable apparatus or means for carrying out the functions or algorithm described below.
At block 702, the wireless communication device may maintain multiple (e.g., two or more) LDPC base graphs, each associated with a different information block length range. For example, the LDPC base graphs may include a first LDPC base graph associated with a first information block length range and a second LDPC base graph associated with a second information block length range. The first information block length range may cover, for example, a baseline information block length range supported by the wireless communication network (e.g., between 100 and 8192 bits). The second information block length range may include a subset of the first information block length range such that the second information block length range is contained completely within the first information block length range (e.g., between 100 and 3200 bits) or overlaps the first information block length range (e.g., between 50 and 3200 bits). Additional LDPC base graphs may also be designed. The LDPC base graphs may be maintained, for example, in memory 605 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6.
 At block 704, the wireless communication device may select an LDPC base graph for encoding an information block of a given information block length. The LDPC base graph may be selected, for example, based, at least in part, on the given information block length of the information block. For example, the wireless communication device may select an LDPC base graph that supports the information block length of the information block. If more than one LDPC base graph supports the information block length of the information block, the wireless communication device may utilize other metrics, such as the code rate and/or lift size to select the LDPC base graph. For example, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may select an LDPC base graph for encoding the information block.
At block 706, the wireless communication device may encode the information block using the selected LDPC base graph to produce a codeword containing information bits of the information block and parity check bits produced by the LDPC encoding process. In some examples, the wireless communication device may select an LDPC graph represented by the LDPC base graph, which may be the LDPC base graph, to encode the information block. For example, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may encode the information block using the select LDPC base graph. At block 708, the wireless communication device may transmit the codeword over a wireless air interface to the receiver (e.g., a receiving wireless communication device). For example, the transceiver 610 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may transmit the codeword to the receiving wireless communication device.
 FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process 800 for low density parity check (LDPC) encoding in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure. As described below, some or all illustrated features may be omitted in a particular implementation within the scope of the present disclosure, and some illustrated features may not be required for implementation of all embodiments. In some examples, the process 800 may be carried out by the wireless communication device illustrated in FIG. 6. In some examples, the process 800 may be carried out by any suitable apparatus or means for carrying out the functions or algorithm described below.
At block 802, the wireless communication device may maintain multiple (e.g., two or more) LDPC base graphs, each associated with a different information block length range. For example, the LDPC base graphs may include a first LDPC base graph associated with a first information block length range and a second LDPC base graph associated with a second information block length range. The first information block length range may cover, for example, a baseline information block length range supported by the wireless communication network (e.g., between 100 and 8192 bits). The second information block length range may include a subset of the first information block length range such that the second information block length range is contained completely within the first information block length range (e.g., between 100 and 3200 bits) or overlaps the first information block length range (e.g., between 50 and 3200 bits). Additional LDPC base graphs may also be designed. The LDPC base graphs may be maintained, for example, in memory 605 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6.
 At block 804, the wireless communication device may receive an information block length of an information block to be encoded using LDPC coding. For example, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may receive the information block length of the information block. At block 806, the wireless communication device may determine whether more than one LDPC base graph supports the information block length of the information block.
If only a single LDPC base graph supports the information block length of the information block (N branch of block 806), at block 808, the wireless communication may select the LDPC base graph that supports the information block length of the information block for encoding of the information block. If more than one LDPC base graph supports the information block length of the information block (Y branch of block 806), at block 810, the wireless communication device may select the LDPC base graph with the highest lift size required to produce the information block length of the information block. For example, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may select an LDPC base graph for encoding the information block.
 At block 812, the wireless communication device may encode the information block using the selected LDPC base graph to produce a codeword containing information bits of the information block and parity check bits produced by the LDPC encoding process. In some examples, the wireless communication device may select an LDPC graph represented by the LDPC base graph, which may be the LDPC base graph, to encode the information block. For example, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may encode the information block using the select LDPC base graph. At block 814, the wireless communication device may transmit the codeword over a wireless air interface to the receiver (e.g., a receiving wireless communication device). For example, the transceiver 610 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may transmit the codeword to the receiving wireless communication device.
FIG. 9 is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process 900 for low density parity check (LDPC) encoding in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure. As described below, some or all illustrated features may be omitted in a particular implementation within the scope of the present disclosure, and some illustrated features may not be required for implementation of all embodiments. In some examples, the process 900 may be carried out by the wireless communication device illustrated in FIG. 6. In some examples, the process 900 may be carried out by any suitable apparatus or means for carrying out the functions or algorithm described below.
 At block 902, the wireless communication device may maintain multiple (e.g., two or more) LDPC base graphs, each associated with a different information block length range. For example, the LDPC base graphs may include a first LDPC base graph associated with a first information block length range and a second LDPC base graph associated with a second information block length range. The first information block length range may cover, for example, a baseline information block length range supported by the wireless communication network (e.g., between 100 and 8192 bits). The second information block length range may include a subset of the first information block length range such that the second information block length range is contained completely within the first information block length range (e.g., between 100 and 3200 bits) or overlaps the first information block length range (e.g., between 50 and 3200 bits). Additional LDPC base graphs may also be designed. The LDPC base graphs may be maintained, for example, in memory 605 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6.
At block 904, the wireless communication device may receive an information block length of an information block to be LDPC encoded using a particular code rate. For example, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may receive the information block length of the information block. At block 906, the wireless communication device may determine whether more than one LDPC base graph supports the information block length of the information block.
 If only a single LDPC base graph supports the information block length of the information block (N branch of block 906), at block 908, the wireless communication may select the LDPC base graph that supports the information block length of the information block for encoding of the information block. If more than one LDPC base graph supports the information block length of the information block (Y branch of block 906), at block 910, the wireless communication device may determine whether more than one LDPC base graph supports the code rate for encoding the information block.
If only a single LDPC base graph supports the code rate (N branch of block 910), at block 912, the wireless communication device may select the LDPC base graph that supports the code rate for encoding the information block. If more than one LDPC base graph supports the code rate (Y branch of block 910), at block 914, the wireless communication device may select the LDPC base graph with the highest lift size required to produce the information block length of the information block. For example, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may select an LDPC base graph for encoding the information block.
 At block 916, the wireless communication device may encode the information block using the selected LDPC base graph to produce a codeword containing information bits of the information block and parity check bits produced by the LDPC encoding process. In some examples, the wireless communication device may select an LDPC graph represented by the LDPC base graph, which may be the LDPC base graph, to encode the information block. For example, the LDPC encoding circuitry 642 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may encode the information block using the select LDPC base graph. At block 918, the wireless communication device may transmit the codeword over a wireless air interface to the receiver (e.g., a receiving wireless communication device). For example, the transceiver 610 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may transmit the codeword to the receiving wireless communication device.
FIG. 10 is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process 1000 for low density parity check (LDPC) decoding in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure. As described below, some or all illustrated features may be omitted in a particular implementation within the scope of the present disclosure, and some illustrated features may not be required for implementation of all embodiments. In some examples, the process 1000 may be carried out by the wireless communication device illustrated in FIG. 6. In some examples, the process 1000 may be carried out by any suitable apparatus or means for carrying out the functions or algorithm described below.
 At block 1002, the wireless communication device may maintain multiple (e.g., two or more) LDPC base graphs, each associated with a different information block length range. For example, the LDPC base graphs may include a first LDPC base graph associated with a first information block length range and a second LDPC base graph associated with a second information block length range. The first information block length range may cover, for example, a baseline information block length supported by the wireless communication network (e.g., between 100 and 8192 bits). The second information block length range may include a subset of the first information block length range such that the second information block length range is contained completely within the first information block length range (e.g., between 100 and 3200 bits) or overlaps the first information block length range (e.g., between 50 and 3200 bits). Additional LDPC base graphs may also be designed. The LDPC base graphs may be maintained, for example, in memory 605 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6.
 At block 1004, the wireless communication device may receive a codeword over a wireless air interface from a transmitter (e.g., a transmitting wireless communication device). For example, the transceiver 610 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may receive the codeword. At block 1006, the wireless communication device may select an LDPC base graph for decoding the codeword containing an information block of a given information block length. The LDPC base graph may be selected, for example, based on the given information block length of the information block. Other metrics, such as the code rate and/or lift size, may also be utilized to select an LDPC base graph. For example, the LDPC decoding circuitry 644 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may select an LDPC base graph for decoding the information block.
At block 1008, the wireless communication device may decode the codeword using the selected LDPC base graph to produce the information block containing information bits. In some examples, the wireless communication device may select an LDPC graph represented by the selected LDPC base graph, which may be the LDPC base graph, to decode the codeword. For example, the LDPC decoding circuitry 644 shown and described above in reference to FIG. 6 may decode the codeword using the select LDPC base graph.
 In one configuration, an apparatus configured for low density parity check (LDPC) coding (e.g., the wireless communication device 500 shown in FIG. 5 and/or the wireless communication device 600 shown in FIG. 6) includes means for maintaining a plurality of LDPC base graphs, where the plurality of LDPC base graphs include at least a first LDPC base graph associated with a first information block length range and a second LDPC base graph associated with a second information block length range, and the second information block length range includes a subset of the first information block length range. The apparatus further includes means for receiving a codeword over a wireless air interface from a transmitter, means for selecting a select LDPC base graph from the plurality of LDPC base graphs for decoding the codeword based on an information block length associated with the codeword, and means for decoding the codeword utilizing the select LDPC base graph to produce an information block having the information block length.

The Hoffmanns did very thoroughly and, while they enjoyed themselves immensely, are delighted to be again in sunny Hawaii. Mrs. Hoffmann is looking particularly well and has planned no end of entertainments for the winter. Mrs. Hoffmann is an ideal hostess. Mr. J. F. Hackfeld, who has been in Germany for the past several weeks, returned to Korea this week. Miss Elizabeth Sargent is the guest of Miss Adele Dreier. The Dreier mansion is most suitably adapted to the note of sincerity in the cantata, entertaining, but owing to Mr. Dreier's death, Miss Dreier is in retirement. She is a most charming girl and has a most charming voice. This was followed by a novelty in these festivals, a violin solo by Miss Elman, accompanied by the string orchestra.

Marx are now in London, writing from there to a personal friend, Mr. Marx says. "We have just been attending the Worcester triennial musical festival and I send you an account of it, thinking that some of the Advertiser readers might be interested in the special features of this meeting. This was the one hundred and eight which the three choirs, held once a year alternately in the cathedrals of Worcester, Hereford, and Gloucester. We arrived in Worcester on the day of the opening service and found the whole town guy with flags, bunting and flowers. Crowds of people were waiting for the doors of the cathedral to open. We saw the mayor and aldermen and all the town officials arrive in their robes of state, headed by squads of policemen. More than three thousand people attended the opening services and as many more could not gain admittance. "Mendelssohn's 'Eliiali' was he nrsi oratorio gien. i 11 ere were three hundred voices in the combined choirs and about one hundred instruments in the string orchestra. The effect of the credence of chorus, organs and orchestra in the cathedral was magnificent. As the Pishop of Worcester said,'most of us felt that we had been permitted to take part in a very Waited and moving form of divine by Sir Charles Stanford, was performed. This was conducted by the composer. I can best describe it by quoting one of the London musical critics: Religious feeling is the mark of the work, and it is the greatest of its dis tinctions, because it has no obligatory connection with art music which may didly be the accoustic properties of the cathedral being perfect, his wonderful tone was heard to full advantage. His pianissimo passages in the rondo were exquisite. A great many Honolulu people are familiar with Mischa El man's playing from hearing phonographic reproductions of it. I wish they could all have heard him play; it was such an improvement on the canned article. The liberality of the cathedral a secular concert was given on Wednesday evening in the public hall." Three new compositions were perform ed for the first time at this concert, the composers conducting; a fantastic, t.relude for orchestra.

The Advertiser presents the following as jogs to Mr. Cathcart's memory, in this connection. The first jog is a receipt for the costs, to be deposited in court, when the suit was filed. It is on the office letterhead, of Cathcart & Parke, is in Cathcart's handwriting and reads as follows: "J. W. Cathcart W C. Parke "Cathcart & Parke "Attorneys at Law, "13 Kaahumanu St. "Honolulu, H. I., March 7, 1899. "Received from G. W. Ahoy the sum of thirty-seven 50-100 dollars as court casts in case Palea et al: vs. Davis. As Mr. Cathcart may not find the amount in his cash book for March 7, 1899, the Advertiser will jog his memory to remember that in fact he received the money a week or so before the 7th, but did not give the receipt until March 7th. And while you are furbishing up your memory, Mr. Cathcart, do not forget to tell what you did with this $37.50. Did you ever deposit it in court as costs? "If not, why not?" If you did not pay it into court, what did you do with it? Goo Wan Hoy says that your answer to this question. Another Jog., The following receipt in Mr. Cathcart's handwriting may also recall to his failing memory that Goo Wan Hoy was a good enough client to collect fees out of, even though he was not enough of a client to pay money over to, after it had been collected on Goo Wan Hoy's account. This is the receipt, written in Cathcart's. She was assisted by Mrs. Soule and Miss Rycroft. Mrs. Marston Campbell and Mrs. Wallace Farrington had the lemonade booth, with its imps and angels. Oranges, lemons and citrus fruit hung in. Mrs. Hallou, Mrs. Robertson, Mrs. Wadhams and Mrs. J. P. Cooke made no end of money there. The ice cream booth, with Irmgard Schaefer as chairman, could not serve the ice cream and cake fast enough to supply the demand, Miss Schaefer was most capably assisted by the thirteen. lovely girls. The ringcake booth was a proper gipsy-camp feature. 1'ots. kettles, pans, dippers, tubs and dishes, with a U'Wing camp fire, made one feel as if 1a.

Mrs. Gerrit Wilder 's was a most ar tistic spot. The garden was hung with Persian, Kashmir and Turkish rugs. A quaint old lodge gate lamp was much admired. The tea and singing in this booth kept it crowded all the evening. The Hawaiian booth was very at tractive and many purchases were made there. There were some magnificent chrys anthemums sold from the flower booth of Mrs. Ballou which caused much fa vorable comment. They were raised by Mrs. A. X.

Now Mr. Cart, with your memory thus refreshed, when you make your full reply to Goo Wan Hoy's charges, please state what the relation between you and Goo Wan Hoy were, if they were not those of attorney and client? If Goo Wan Hoy was not the real party in interest, why did you pay a part of the money which you collected from W.E. Castle, in this case, to Attorney Humphreys when a Goo Wan Hoy's attorney he sued you for it? And again, when collector Harry T. Mills, acting for Goo Wan Hoy, got after you for the last $5." Of your note, last April, why did you pay him $75, after blushing him out of the other $20, if Goo Wan Hoy was not your client, and therefore entitled to receive the frazzle ends of what there was left of the proceeds of the case, which you had collected from W. R. Castle. Now really, Mr. Cathcart was not Good Van Hoy your client? If he was not your client, why did you pay him anything. If he was your client, why did you not pay him all that you collected from W. R. Castle, in settlement of the case? The candy and pillow booths were in one stall, the color scheme being red, yellow and green. The idea was most artistically carried out, and crotons of the same colors harmonized. The easy divans and lounging chairs made the pillow and candy booth one of great beauty. Mrs. Swanzy's pillows sold very rapidly, and, needless to say, the candies were gone before the evening was half over. The ladies assisting in this booth did much for the Humane Society. The grab bag was immense, the girls netting a deal of money. Miss Sargent was in charge. Miss Adele Dreier donated the money for this booth, which was a most generous gift and greatly appreciated. The post office was no end of fun, and all kinds of letters were received, some of them very funny. Mrs. Cornwell and Mrs. Kingsbury, with their assistants, did admirably. The peanut fortune booth was a great success, and the girls assisting Mrs. Augustus Murphy not only had heaps of fun, but sold their peanuts profitably. The ladies having the dance badges were simply stunning. Herr Berger discoursed sweet music until ten, when the dance in The ballroom started. Mr. Hertscbe, Mr. Jones and Mr. Hoffman were unfailing in their efforts to assist, and without their many kindnesses the fete could not have been. The ilima lei and gipsy bead booth was a pretty affair and designed after an ideal Hungarian gipsy camp, and the costumes worn by the ladies in charge were designed after the Hungarian garb of the Romanies. The camp was set on the drive under the windows of the parlor, and there amid the soft glow of incense a pretty dark red tent was raised against the wall in which were heaped beautiful paper ilima leis and bead necklaces. A gipsy camp kettle, under which a fire glowed, bubbling over with beads, palms and logs of wood gave a real Roman toch to the scene. Probably no booth was filled with so completely garbed ladies in the true gipsy costume. The booth was in charge of Mrs. Albert P. Taylor, assisted by Mrs. Henry Afong, Miss Irene Boyd, Mrs. M. D. Brown, Miss Ruth Johnson and the little Misses Harriet and Marie Davison. The ladies were almost all alike and the arm, neck, ear and hair ornaments, of copper, representing Turkish gold, gave a barbaric touch. The skirts were composed of bandana kerchiefs, alternating with bands of yellow crepe, with blouses of yellow silk. For shoulder drapes there were fringed shawls hanging loosely, for two things cherished by gipsy belles are the fringed shawl and garnished skirt. The bandana kerchiefs sold by this Both were in great demand among the young men, and these with the beads and leis netted the booth about $102. Miss Power has just received a new assortment of the latest models in Fall and Winter millinery by the Korea.

Article: Heated floor board

ABSTRACT

A flooring system includes a plurality of connectable sheet elements that have heating wires embedded therein. The sheet elements include starting sections, ending sections, middle sections and corners sections with the thermostat having long wires for connection to the starting and ending sheets. The sheet elements can be used in a bathroom or the like. The floor system of the present invention is installed underneath tile floors to heat the tile floor.
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to the general art of building materials, and to the particular field of flooring.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In heating the interiors of buildings, several conventional heating methods have been employed, including hot water/steam and forced air heating. Generally, these heating methods require the installation of large air ducts or extensive water piping, both of which take up a considerable amount of space within a building and require careful planning for locations of vents, radiators, and so forth. Vents and ducts tend to obstruct living and working areas within a building and require other components of the building (ceilings, walls, etc.) to be designed around them. Some hot water systems include piping which is embedded in a flooring or ceiling material through which warm water is circulated to heat a building. In some geographic localities, however, electrical power is cheaper than gas, and direct electric heating is desired.
 In heating the interiors of buildings and of building floors, several conventional heating methods have been employed, including hot water/steam and forced air heating. Generally, these heating methods require the installation of large air ducts or extensive water piping, both of which take up a considerable amount of space within a building and require careful planning for locations of vent, radiators and so forth. Vents and ducts tend to obstruct living and working areas within a building and require other components of the building (ceilings, walls, etc.) to be designed around them. Some hot water systems include piping which is embedded in a flooring or ceiling material through which warm water is circulated to heat a building. In some geographic localities, however, electrical power is cheaper than gas, and direct electric heating is desired.
Electric heating cables have been employed to heat cement slabs and the like by being positioned in a layer beneath the slabs. High limit switches have been employed adjacent the cables to sense the cable temperatures and to prevent the cables from over heating. Temperature sensors imbedded in the concrete slabs regulate the electric current supplied to the heating cable, thereby regulating room heat by controlling the temperature of the concrete where the electric heating cables are embedded. Positioning the temperature sensors in the room air space above the flooring results in prohibitively long response times.
 Heated floors are previously known in a number of different forms, for example a plaster netting can be laid on top of the supporting structure and be fixed to the surface of the floor structure by gluing, for example. The electrical heating cable is then fixed to the plaster netting, first being laid out in a loop pattern and then being fixed by hot melt adhesive to the plaster netting. When the electrical heating cable has been completely laid out, it is covered with a plastering material in such a manner as to cover completely. The covering plaster is then allowed to dry and is then provided with an adhesive for laying, so-called clinker. The disadvantages of these methods are the risk of having the wrong cc-distance between the heating cables, a too small bending radius which involves the risk of cable breakage in addition to the fact that laying, drying and curing take a long time before the electrical heating cable can be used, usually one month. Similar constructions are also available where the electrical heating cable has been replaced by water pipes, for example PEX-piping.
In other floor systems that the inventor is aware of, it is required that wires must be mudded in with thinset over the cement board which is time consuming and makes the floor difficult to level.
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The above-discussed disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by a flooring system that includes a plurality of connectable sheet elements that have heating wires embedded therein. The sheet elements include starting sections, ending sections, middle sections and corners sections with the thermostat having two long wires that connect to the start and end sheets. The sheet elements can be used in a bathroom or the like. The floor system of the present invention is installed underneath tile floors to heat the tile floor.
Using the flooring system embodying the present invention eliminates the step of installing the heated floor over the cement board. This will reduce the cost, at least in installation time.
Other systems, methods, features, and advantages of the invention will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES

The invention can be better understood with reference to the following drawings and description. The components in the figures are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention. Moreover, in the figures, like referenced numerals designate corresponding parts throughout the different views.
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a flooring system embodying the present invention.
FIG. 2 is a sectional view taken along line 2-2 of FIG. 1.
FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a middle sheet of the flooring system embodying the present invention.
FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a corner sheet of the flooring system embodying the present invention.
 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

Referring to the figures, it can be understood that the present invention is embodied in a flooring system 10. Flooring system 10 comprises a plurality of sheets, such as sheet 12. Each sheet includes a first surface 14 that is a top surface when the sheet is in use, a first edge 18 and a second edge 20. An electrical resistance heating wire 30 is embedded in each sheet and is sinuous in shape as shown in FIG. 2. The plurality of sheets includes a starting sheet 30S, an ending sheet 30E, a middle sheet 30M and a corner sheet 30C. The sheets are laid in the usual manner.
A first connector 40 is on the first edge of each sheet and a second connector 42 is located on the second edge of each sheet. As can be understood from the figures, the first and second connectors are electrically connected to the heating wire embedded in each sheet and are adapted so that a first connector on one sheet can be electrically connected to a second connector on an adjacent sheet whereby a single electrical circuit is defined through a floor formed of the plurality of sheets.
Sheet connectors 50 and 52 are located on each sheet and are adapted to physically connect each sheet to at least one adjacent sheet. The sheet connectors are designed to connect to each other or to sink into the thinset flush with the board. A power source P, such as utility power or the like is used to supply electricity to the heating wire to cause that wire to generate heat.
 A thermostat 60 is connected to the starting and ending sheet and power source and a thermometer 70 is connected to one of the sheets and to the thermostat. The thermostat is set to a desired temperature and the sheet temperature is read by the thermometer. When the sheet temperature reaches the temperature set on the thermostat, the thermostat either reduced power to the heating wire or shuts off power to the thermostat in a manner well known to those skilled in the thermostat art.
Each sheet is marked with a mark 74 so an installer will know where the heating wire is located. This will permit the installer to avoid placing a nail or a screw through the heating wire. The thermostat will have extra long wires, such as wire 80, to leave slack for the wire to run along the wall to go down to the starting and ending sheets. The board will be installed with thinset and nails or screws.
Areas where traffic will not occur can be formed using sheets which do not include heating wire if desired. The floor system of the present invention is installed underneath tile floors to heat the tile floor.
While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be restricted except in light of the attached claims and their equivalents.

Article: Reynolds's two greatest rivals came to town about this time — Gainsborough (an old one) in 1774, and George Romney [q. v.], fresh from Italy, in 1775. The latter became so fashionable that, according to a remark of Lord Thurlow, ' there was a Reynolds faction and a Romney faction.' There was also another painter who, if not a serious rival, was a spiteful enemy. This was Nathaniel Hone, who sent to the exhibition of 1775 a picture called ' The Pictorial Conjuror dis- playing the whole Art of Optical Deception/ which represented Reynolds clothing models with garments taken from well-known pic- tures which float about the room. Of course it was rejected. Sir Joshua sent twelve pictures to the exhibition of 1775, which comprised a por- trait (of Dr. Richard Robinson [q. v.], pri- mate of Ireland, now at Christ Church, Oxford) which Horace Walpole declared was the best he ever painted, and ' Mrs. Sheridan as St. Cecilia,' perhaps the most lovely in its feeling of any of his works. There was also a charming picture of chil- dren, ' A Beggar Boy and his Sister/ now called ' Boy with Cabbage Nets.' This year Northcote left Reynolds to start on his own account, his master warning him that ' some- thing more is to be done than that which did formerly ; Kneller, Lely, and Hudson will not do now.' In 1776 Sir Joshua painted his portrait for the Uffizzi Gallery at Florence, and sent it with a long and graceful letter in Italian. In this year Hannah More, who was in the height of her reputation as a poetess, visited London. She was treated by Reynolds with his invariable courtesy, and was greatly pleased with his 'Infant Samuel' and 'St. John/ then on his easel. The former (probably the most popular of all his pictures, and more than once repeated) is in the National Gallery. It was exhibited this year as 'The Child Daniel/ together with the ' St. John/ also a child. These and two portraits, Master Herbert as Bacchus and Master Crewe as Henry VIII (the latter an admirable bit of masquerade), show how much his time was now devoted to children. A rarer subject, and treated with much effect, was Omiah the Otaheitan, a ' lion' of the season ; and other portraits of the year, of very fine quality, were those of the Duchess of Devonshire, Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu [q. v.] (the Queen of the ' Blues '), and Lord Temple, while one of Garrick takes rank among his greatest masterpieces of character. Sir Joshua's famous groups of the Dilet- tanti Society, of which he had been elected a member in 1766, and painter in 1769, Reynolds Reynolds though not completed till 1780, were com- menced in 1777, in which year he spent August and part of November at Blenheim in painting his great picture of the Marl- borough family. It was sent to the academy in 1778, with a half-length of the archbishop of York and two other portraits. The lovely picture of Mrs. Payne-Gallwey, with her child riding 'pick-a-back' — remarkable for the beauty of both landscape and figures — be- longs to the same year, a considerable portion of which was spent on the pictures designed for reproduction in the west window of New College Chapel, Oxford. They consisted of a l Nativity' and the seven ( Virtues.' The * Nativity, 'the most important of Sir Joshua's religious pictures, was elegantly grouped and beautifully lighted, after the manner of Cor- reggio's ' Notte,' by rays proceeding from the infant Saviour. The picture perished by fire at Belvoir Castle in 1816, together with one of the richest collections of Reynolds's works. The ' Virtues,' especially ' Charity ' (with her children), are all beautiful. Mrs. Sheridan sat for the Virgin in the ' Nativity,' and also for the ' Charity.' The pictures of the ' Vir- tues ' were bought by Lord Normanton at the Marchioness of Thomond's sale in 1821 for 5,565/., ' Charity ' fetching 1,575/., and his lordship subsequently refused three times this price for them. In 1778 Reynolds commenced his acquaint- ance with Miss Burney, which was warmly sustained until the end of his life. She has left us a vivid account of her first visit to Leicester Fields, where she met with ' more scrupulous delicacy from Sir Joshua than from anybody.' About this time the 'Blue Stockings' were at their height, and Sir Joshua was a constant guest of Mrs. Montagu, Mrs. Vesey, Mrs. Ord, Mrs. Walsingham, Mrs. Cholmondeley, and Mrs. Thrale. It is to the lively pen of the last that we owe the cele- brated picture of Sir Joshua in society : Of Reynolds all good should be said and no harm, Though the heart is too frigid, the pencil too warm ; Yet each fault from his converse we still must disclaim, As his temper 'tis peaceful, and pure as his fame ; Nothing in it o'erflows, nothing ever is wanting, It nor chills like his kindness, nor glows like his painting. When Johnson by strength overpowers our mind, When Montague dazzles, and Burke strikes us blind, To Reynolds well pleased for relief we must run, Eejoice in his shadow, and shrink from the sun. The acquittal of Keppel at his memorable trial in 1779 (the year also of Garrick's and Hudson's death) was not only a source of 1 great pleasure but of some profit to his old friend Reynolds, who was commissioned by the admiral to paint portraits of him for pre- sentation to his counsel, Dunning, Erskine, and Lee, and to Burke. The king and queen also sat to Sir Joshua this year (for the portraits | for the academy's new rooms at Somerset House, which were opened next year). The Prince of Wales and Gibbon, and a few noble- men, including the Duke and Duchess of Hamilton, also sat to him ; but his sitters I were few, a great part of his time being still i occupied with the ' Nativity,' which (with i ' Faith,' ' Hope,' and ' Charity') was sent to i the exhibition of 1779. but almost repainted afterwards. This exhibition also contained I his full-length of Viscountess Crosbie, re- I markable for its suggestion of swift and grace- j ful movement. In this year the public were agitated by fears of a French invasion, but Reynolds wrote to Burke : t My mind has | been so much occupied by my business that I I have escaped feeling those terrors that 1 seem to have possessed all the rest of man- | kind.' The opening of the academy's rooms in | Somerset House was the great professional j event of 1780. The centre of the ceiling of the library was painted by Sir Joshua, with a figure of 'Theory' (now in the academy's gallery in Burlington House), and he exhi- bited, among other works, his portrait of Gibbon, a masterpiece ; the charming full- length of Prince William Frederick, son of the Duke of Gloucester, and his duchess (the often-painted Maria, erst Lady Walde- grave) ; the design of ' Justice ' for the New College window ; and a portrait (as Una) of the daughter of Topham Beauclerk, whose death this year made a gap in the ranks of the Literary Club and the friendships of Reynolds. In June of this year occurred the ' Gordon riots,' when Sir George Savile's house in Leicester Fields was gutted before Reynolds's eyes, and an attack on the aca- demy was threatened. In 1781 Sir Joshua painted ' Mrs. Nisbett as Circe,' and exhibited the celebrated group of the Ladies Waldegrave, the great-nieces of Horace Walpole, embroidering and winding silk, and no fewer than thirteen other pictures, which included the ' Death of Dido' (now at Buckingham talace), one of the most im- portant of his works of this class ; ' Thais,' for which the lady afterwards known as Emma lady Hamilton [q. v.] sat at the request of Reynolds Reynolds the Hon. Charles Greville ; aiid a ' Child asleep.' Among1 the portraits were the lovely Duchess of Rutland, a group of her children, Master Bunbury, the son of ' Little Comedy,' and Dr. Burney (for Mr. Tlirale). He also painted ' Mrs. Thrale and her daughter Queenie' in this year, during which Thrale died, and the Streutham gallery came to an end. In July he went to Flanders and Hol- land with Mr. Metcalfe, and took elaborate notes of the pictures, which were published after his death. Later in the year he painted ' Offy,' now Mrs. R. L. Gwatkin, and her husband. In 1782 Sir Joshua exhibited fifteen pic- | tures, including portraits of Lord-chancellor I Thurlow, who afterwards called him t a | great scoundrel and a bad painter;' Mrs. j Mary Robinson (Perdita), already discarded \ by her royal lover, but still in the flower of : her beauty; William Beckford (then twenty- I three, but already the author of * Vathek,' not yet published) ; two little boys, sons of ! William Brummel. one of whom was to de- j velop into the ' Beau ; ' Captain (afterwards | Sir Ban aster) Tarleton [q. v.], celebrated for his brilliant feats during the American cam- paign ; and Mrs. Baldwin, the ' fair Greek/ wife of the English consul at Smyrna, seated cross-legged on a divan in striped green silk and turbanlike head-dress. In this year Reynolds finished his annotations to Mason's translation of Du Fresnoy's ' Art of Painting ; ' John Opie [q. v.], to Avhom Reynolds had given advice and encourage- ment, now became for a while a very fashion- able portrait-painter. Reynolds had called upon Gainsborough shortly after he came to London, and Gains- borough never returned the visit ; but in November this year Reynolds sat to Gains- borough, ' the nearest rapprochement,' says Leslie, ' recorded of these illustrious rivals, till Sir Joshua was called by the dying Gainsborough to his bedside.' The progress of the portrait was cut short by a paralytic attack, which caused serious alarm to Sir Joshua's friends, and brought a letter from Johnson, then at Brighthelmstone, in which strong affection beats through studied lan- guage. His physician sent him to Bath, and by the end of the month he was back again in his usual health ; but his sittings to Gainsborough were never renewed. He sent only ten pictures to the exhibition in 1783 (a small number at that time for him), and they did not comprise any of particular note; but his powers were unabated, and he this year painted what may be regarded as his masterpiece, the picture of Mrs. Siddons as the ' Tragic Muse.' The conception of the picture is taken from Michael Angelo's 'Isaiah;' but, according to Mrs. Siddons's account, she assumed the attitude sponta- neously. The picture is signed at full length in ornamental characters on the border of her dress, Sir Joshua saying that he could not lose the opportunity of going down to posterity on the hem of her garment. He inscribed Lady Cockburn's drapery in a similar way. It was in 1 783 that James Barry (1 74 1-1806) [q.v.] ended his long and noble labour in the hall of the Society of Arts in the Adelphi, which was thrown open to the public on the same day as the exhibition of the Royal Academy. In the pamphlet which he issued as a companion to the exhibition, Barry poured forth his long-bottled wratli against the academy in general and Sir Joshua in particular, not scrupling to insinuate vile charges against Sir Joshua's private charac- ter. For these hereafter he made amends by supporting Sir Joshua in his quarrel with the academy, and, immediately after his death, by pronouncing in his sixth lecture a warm eulogium on Sir Joshua's genius and character. But there was no excuse, except an overstrained mind, for his attacks in 1783 ; for Sir Joshua had been very kind to him when he came to London, and— till 1767 at least — Barry had professed unbounded admiration for Sir Joshua's skill. For once Sir Joshua entertained feelings of animosity, and told Northcote that he feared he hated Barry. This year Reynolds visited the Duke of Rutland at Belvoir, Lord Harcourt at Nuneham, the Eliots at Port Eliot, and the Parkers at Saltram. He also perhaps went to Flanders. He certainly did so in 1785 to see the pictures which the monasteries had been compelled to sell, and made some valuable purchases. On this occasion, as on others, he probably bought for others as well as for himself. Besides the Mrs. Siddons, the exhibition of 1784 contained among his sixteen con- tributions the portraits of Fox and Warton, of Lady Dashwood and her child, Lady Honeywood and her children, and Mrs. Abington as Roxalana, altogether a magni- ficent display of varied power. In Decem- ber of this year another irreparable gap was made in the inner circle of his friend- ships by the death of Johnson, with whom he had lived in unbroken intimacy more than thirty years. Nobody admired John- son more or understood him better, and to no one was lie a truer friend. lie was one of the few who could get the better of John- son in conversation, and could effectually protect others, like Goldsmith, from the brutality of his assaults; and on the rare Reynolds 64 Reynolds occasions when this was directed towards himself, as when Johnson accused him of taking too much wine, he could retort with a force and justice which brought the old gladiator to his knees. He assisted Johnson with some notes to his edition of Shake- speare. He exerted himself to procure John- son's pension, and, shortly before his death, to obtain from the government a grant to enable him to go to Italy for his health. Johnson from the first conceived a high opinion of Eeynolds's intelligence, and his admiration and affection only increased as life went on. Johnson characterised Rey- nolds as * the most invulnerable man I know ; the man with whom if you should quarrel, you would find the most difficulty how to abuse.' Sir Joshua was appointed one of his executors, and received as a legacy Martiniere's ' French Dictionary ' and Johnson's own copy of his ' Dictionary.' On his deathbed he made Sir Joshua promise not to use his pencil on Sunday, to read the Bible whenever possible and always on Sundays, and to forgive him 30/. which he owed him, as he wished to leave the money to a poor family. Reynolds did not strictly perform the first promise. Sir Joshua left two dialogues in which Johnson's method of conversation is admirably caricatured, and also a paper containing a singularly just estimate of his character (all these are printed in Leslie's life). Another of Johnson's executors was Ed- mund Malone [q. v.], whom Reynolds had painted as early as 1774, and who became one of Sir Joshua's most intimate friends. Sir Joshua submitted to him at least one of his discourses for revision, and he published a collection of Sir Joshua's writings, with a memoir, in 1797. Miss Palmer wrote to a cousin in Calcutta in January 1786 : ' My uncle seems more bewitched than ever with his palette and pencils ; he is painting from morning to night, and the truth is that every picture he does seems better than the former.' He exhibited sixteen pictures in 1785, thirteen in 1786 and 1787, and seventeen in 1788. To these years belong some of the most celebrated of all his pictures of all kinds : the three pictures for Boydell's ' Shakespeare,' 'The Witch Scene in Mac- beth,' t The Death of Cardinal Beaufort,' and best of the trio, the * Puck,' the ' Cymon and Iphigenia,' and the ' Infant Hercules ' (painted for the Empress of Russia), the Duchess of Devonshire playing hot cockles with her baby, and the group of Lady Smyth and her children, both unsurpassed in their different ways ; his noblest heroic portrait, the Lord Heathfield (in the National Gal- lery), the fine intellectual characterisations of Hunter, Sheridan, Boswell, Erskine, and Philippe Egalite ; some of his loveliest female heads : Lavinia, Lady Spencer and her sis- ter, Lady Betty Foster, and Mrs. Braddyl ; and some of his most exquisite pictures of childhood, as the cherub-head in different views (portraits of Lord William Gordon's little girl, now in the National Gallery), the ' Simplicity ' (Offy's daughter), and Penelope Boothby. He was still as fond of society as ever (he joined a new club called ' The Eume- lian,' after Dr. John Ash [q. v.], in ] 787), and in unimpaired health. But while engaged in painting a portrait (probable that of Lady Beauchamp), his eyesight suddenly failed. Against the entries of his appointments for Monday, 13 July 1789, is written ' Prevented by my eye beginning to be obscured.' In ten weeks' time he entirely lost the sight of one eye ; and, though he painted a little on his unfinished pictures till November 1790, he never commenced another. The progress of the disease, ' gutta serena,' was after- wards slow, and he never entirely lost the sight of the other eye, being able to write his will with his own hand on 5 Nov. 1791. These last years were marked by almost the only disagreeable episode in his professional life, the conduct of the academy in opposing with much rudeness his proposal to elect Joseph Bonomi the elder [q.v.] to full mem- bership in order to fill the vacant chair of professor of perspective. Reynolds in dis- gust resigned his presidency and member- ship (23 Feb. 1790), but resumed them at the request of the academy (16 March). It is interesting to note that his late anta- gonist Barry was on this occasion his most vehement supporter, and that a leader in the movement against the president was his old friend Sir William Chambers. To the ex- hibition this year he sent his own portrait, one of Mrs. Billington, and four others. In June he attended with Boswell the execution of an old servant of Mrs. Thrale, for which he was blamed in the papers. The draft of a letter in defence was found among his letters, and is printed by Leslie (ii. 588- 589). In December he delivered his fifteenth and last discourse, in which he referred with much dignity to the recent differences with the academy. During its delivery one of the beams which supported the floor gave way with a sudden crash, and the audience rushed to the door ; but Sir Joshua did not move from his seat, and as soon as confidence was restored he resumed his discourse as if nothing had happened. It concluded with an eloquent eulogium of Michael Angelo, and in its final passage he said : ' I should de- Reynolds Reynolds sire that the last words I should pronounce in this academy and from this place might be the name of Michael Angelo. And these were the last words he pronounced there. In the beginning of 1791 Reynolds paid visits to Burke at Beaconsfield, and Lord Ossory at Ampthill. He offered his collection of old masters to the Royal Academy at a very low price, and, on their refusal, exhi- bited them at a room in the Haymarket, with the view of disposing of them, but gave the Profits of the exhibition to his old servant, lalph Kirkley. In the catalogue, which he wrote himself, he called it ' Ralph's Exhi- bition.' He still attended the meetings of the academy, and was greatly interested in the erection of the monument to Johnson in St. Paul's Cathedral, offering to supply from his own purse any deficit (at that time equal to 300/.) in the subscriptions received. In May he sat for his portrait, for the last time, to the Swedish artist De Breda. His exertions for his friends were still constant. Bosvvell was appointed secretary of foreign correspondence to the academy, and Dr. Thomas Barnard [q. v.] (bishop of Killaloe) their chaplain ; and in this year also the friends of Miss Burney, of whom Sir Joshua was one of the most active, procured her release from her office at court, which had much affected her health and spirits. She has left a touching account of two visits to him in his last illness, during which Boswell was a frequent visitor, and his niece, Miss Palmer, attended him with assiduous affec- tion. About September 1791 his usual spirits began to give way under the apprehension of total blindness, and he began to suffer from loss of appetite, due probably to the disease which had begun to affect his liver, but was not discovered till a fortnight be- fore his death. He died tranquilly and with little pain, between eight and nine o'clock on Thursday evening, 23 Feb. 1792, at his house in Leicester Fields. Within a few hours of his death Burke wrote an obituary notice, in which the essen- tial qualities of his character and his genius were set forth in words of singular truth and elegance. His executors were Burke, Malone, and Metcalfe,who proposed that the body should be removed to the academy, and that the funeral should proceed thence to St. Paul's. An objection, raised by Sir William Chambers, that the academy had no power to use their rooms for the purpose, was overruled by the king, and the night before the funeral the body lay in state in a portion of the model academy, which was hung with black and lighted with wax candles in^silver sconces. He was buried in the crypt of St. VOL. XLVIII. Paul's on Saturday, 3 March, in a grave next to that of his friend, Bishop Newton, and near to that of Wren. The pall-bearers were the Dukes of Dorset, Leeds, and Portland, the Marquises Townshend and Abercorn, the Earls of Carlisle, Inchiquin, and Upper Os- sory, Viscount Palmerston and Lord Eliot. The procession numbered ninety-one car- riages, and the followers included the whole body of the academy and its students, and between fifty and sixty of the most distin- guished men in England. The sense of loss extended to the throng. ' Never,' wrote Burke, ' was a funeral of ceremony attended with so much sincere concern of all sorts of people.' A monument in the cathedral was erected in 1813, designed by Flaxman and inscribed with a Latin epitaph by Payne Knight. The bulk of his fortune was left to Miss Palmer, who inherited in all nearly 100,000/., and was this year (1792) married to the Earl of Inchiquin (afterwards Marquis of Thomond). He left Mrs. Gwatkin (Offy) 10,OOW., and his own sister Frances 2,500/. for life, with reversion to Miss Palmer. To Edmund Burke he left 2,0001. besides can- celling a bond to the like amount ; to the Earl of Upper Ossory and Lord Palmerston he left the choice of one of his pictures (the former chose the ' Nymph and Boy ' or ' Venus and Cupid,' the latter •' The Infant Academy ') ; to Sir Abraham Hume the choice of his Claudes ; to Sir George Beaumont Sebas- tian Bourdon's ' Return of the Ark' (now in the National Gallery) ; and to the Duke of Portland his own picture of an l Angel and the Cross ' (the upper part of the ' Na- tivity'). To Mason he left the celebrated miniature of Milton by Cooper ; to Richard Burke, junior, another of Cromwell, by the same artist ; to his nephew, W7illiam John- son, his watch and seals ; to Mrs. Bunbury the portrait of her son ; to Mrs. Gwyn her own portrait; and 1,OQO/. to his old servant, Ralph Kirkley. Reynolds was the greatest portrait-painter that England has produced, and one of the greatest painters of the world. Mr. Rus- kin ranks him among the 'seven supreme colourists,' the others being Titian, Giorgione, Correggio, Tintoretto, Veronese, and Turner, and says: * Considered as a painter of indi- viduality in the human form and mind, I think him, even as it is, the prince of por- trait-painters. Titian paints nobler pictures and Vandyck had nobler subjects, but neither of them entered so subtly as Sir Joshua did into the minor varieties of human heart and temper' (The Two Paths, Lect. 2). His chief defect was in his draughtsmanship of Reynolds 66 Reynolds limbs, which is often faulty, owing to his want of training ; but no one was more con- scious of this defect, or more clever in con- cealing it. Owing to the employment of fugitive pigments and constant experiments in vehicles, many of his pictures faded so soon after they left his easel that Horace Walpole suggested that they should be paid for by annuities so long as they lasted. In- iudicious cleaning has ruined others, but many have stood well, and it may be said now, as was said in his lifetime, that a laded Sir Joshua is finer than a fresh work by an- other hand. The beauty of his disposition and the nobility of his character were equal to his talents. Without any physical advantages— for he was neither tall nor handsome, and had the great social drawback of deafness— he secured without seeking, and maintained without effort, a position in society which is almost unrivalled. Treating all men on the plain level of common human nature and un- actuated by any prejudice, he mixed, as by natural charter, with all classes. His princi- pal passports were kindliness, sincerity, and tolerance ; but these were aided by a ready sympathy, a well-informed mind, gentle man- ners, and invariable tact and common-sense. The charm of his presence and conversation was all the more irresistible because it was unforced and unfeigned. He was a born diplo- matist, and avoided friction by natural in- stinct ; a philosopher who early learnt anc consistently acted on the principle not tc concern himself about matters of small im- portance. He was thus able to smooth hi own path and that of others, and to preserve his mind from mean and paltry thoughts The keynote of his whole life was his art — whether consciously or not he acted up tr the ideal of a perfect portrait-painter— whos business was not to criticise b not to direct but to reflect the currents c society. 'I go,' he said, ' with the grea stream of life.' For the purpose of such career the hours which he spent in his paint- ing-room were not more profitable than those he spent out of it. It is but natural that such a life should expose him to charges of poco-curanteism, and that it should tend to the repression of much that is salient and picturesque in personal character; but with- out his dispassionate view of things that did not vitally affect his profession or his friends, he would have been neither the great artist nor the great gentleman that he was. The numerous anecdotes of his life give many instances of his charity in thought and deed to poor people, to struggling artists, to his friends and to their friends ; and he never turned his back on an associate in trouble, political or social, as is shown by his conduct to Wilkes, to Baretti, to Warren Hastings, and to Samuel Foote. His literary works consist mainly 01. Discourses,' which probably received some olish from Johnson, Burke, Malone, and thers before they were published, but were ssentially his own both in style and thought. They were the result less of reading than xperience, and are distinguished by that Droad and happy generalisation which was he characteristic also of his art. Perhaps he best known of them is the fourteenth 1788), in which he pronounced his fine and generous tribute to the memory of Gains- Dorough. They contain advice to students which is of permanent value, expressed in language which could scarcely be improved. If we make some allowance for the time at which he wrote, most of his judgments on pictures and artists may be accepted now. His ideas are generally sound, and if there sometimes seems a discrepancy between his practice and his theory it is greatly due to the fact that he was a portrait-painter, while his addresses dealt with ideal art. This dis- crepancy would be more perceptible if he had not applied the style of the greatest ideal artists to his own portraits. The spirit of Michael Angelo, Raphael, and Correggio, and of his favourite Bolognese masters is often felt in his most original portraits. The least valuable of the ' Discourses ' is that upon sculpture. They have been frequently reprinted, and cannot be neglected by any student of art criticism. An excellent sum- mary of them is given in Phillips s 'Sir Joshua Reynolds.' In March 1795 many of his pictures by old masters were sold by auction at Christie's for 10 319/. 2s. Qd. ; in 1796 the contents of the studio fetched 4,535J. 18s. at Greenwood's ; in 1798 a further sale of his ' old masters took place at H. Phillips's ; and in 1821 the pictures, drawings by old masters, and prints retained by LadyThomond brought 15,040J. at Christie's. Since then Sir Joshua's pic- tures, especially the female portraits, have increased enormously in value. His portrait of Lady Betty Delme was sold at Christie's in 1894 for eleven thousand guineas. The largest sum received by Sir Joshua for a portrait picture was probably the seven hun- dred guineas paid him for the great Marl- borough group. Horace Walpole said he paid more for the group of the Ladies Walde- grave, but this is not credited. The Em- press Catherine paid him fifteen hundred guineas for the ' Infant Hercules,' and added a gold box with her cipher in diamonds. Reynolds 67 Reynolds He received twelve hundred guineas from the Duke of Rutland for the ' Nativity.' About seven hundred plates have been engraved after Reynolds, by McArdell, J. R. Smith, Valentine Green, J. Watson, T. Watson, E. Fisher, J. Dixon, R. Houston, W. Dickinson, J. Jones, (I. Marchi, W. Sharp, Samuel Cousins, and others. Fine and rare proofs of these now fetch very large prices, in some cases exceeding those obtained by Reynolds for the pictures. In 1895 a proof of ' Mrs. Pelham feeding Chickens,' en- graved by W. Dickinson, was sold at Christie's for 3261. 10s. A series of 350 small plates were published about 1825 by the engraver Samuel William Reynolds [q. v.] To these, from 1860 onwards, were added 270 — plates after subjects not included in the first series ; all these plates have been recently issued in a complete form by Messrs. Henry Graves &Co. A perfect list of the works of Sir Joshua and the dates when they were painted has not hitherto appeared, owing to the absence of a few of his pocket-books. But his ledgers, in which he recorded the prices he received for his pictures from 1760 till his death, are in the possession of Mr. Algernon Graves, who has been long engaged, in conjunction with Mr. W. Cronin, in preparing a com- plete work on the subject. FRANCES REYNOLDS (1729-1807), the youngest sister of Sir Joshua, was born on 6 June 1729. She kept Sir Joshua's house for many years after he came to London, and employed herself in miniature and other painting. But her temperament was not congenial to her brother, and when her nieces, the Misses Palmer, were old enough to take her place, she (at a date not precisely recorded, but before 15 Feb. 1779) left his house for ever. Madame d'Arblay tells us that she was ' a woman of worth and under- standing but of a singular character,' and that this singularity consisted in never knowing her own mind about anything, and in a tire- some fidgetiness which made her very diffi- cult to live with. The separation from her brother caused her lasting regret. She felt, according- to a draft of a letter found among her papers, that she had been ( thrown out of the path nature had in a peculiar manner fitted ' (her) < for.' After leaving her brother, who made her an allowance, she went first to Devonshire, and then, in 1768, to stay with a Miss Flint in Paris, where Reynolds visited her ; she afterwards lived as* a lodger of Dr. John Hoole [q. v.], whose portrait, prefixed to the first edition of his translation of Ariosto, was painted by her. Of her work as an artist there were different opinions. Sir Joshua, speaking of the copies which she made of his pictures, says ' they make other people laugh and me cry ; ' but a letter of Northcote's says that ' she paints very fine, both history and portrait.'

It is certain that he was for some time at Christ's College, and it may be that he was elected fellow of | Corpus Christi in 1510. The statement that he was university preacher in 1509 is doubt- less due to some confusion. In 1513 he was admitted to the degree of B.D., without being bound to scholastic acts and residence, on the ground that he was about to enter the monastic order before St. Barnabas's day, and F2 Reynolds 68 Reynolds that he would have authority to preach by papal bull. Afterwards he was apparently advanced to the degree of D.D. He became one of the thirteen monks of the Bridgettine or Brigittine Monastery of Sion, who had a wing of the building to themselves, the inmates of the rest being nuns. He was one of the foremost scholars of the day. Car- dinal Pole, who knew him familiarly, says that not only was he a man of most holy life, but he was the only English monk well versed in the three principal languages (Latin, Greek, and Hebrew), ' quibus omnis liberalis doctrina continetur.' A foreigner who had conversed with him in England writes of him as a man with the countenance and spirit of an angel (Guil Covrini Nucerini Epistola, in More's Latin works, p. 349, Frank- fort, 1689). In April 1535 he was accused of having said a year before that Catherine of Arragon was the true queen, notwithstanding the king's marriage with Anne Boleyn, and of having talked with a neighbour of the scandals about Anne and her sister Mary. At this time he seems to have been 'the father of Sion' — that is to say, superior of the monks there. He was examined about the same time as his fellow-martyrs, the Carthusians, before Thomas Cromwell at the Rolls, as to whether he would accept the royal supremacy over the church : and, on his refusal to do so, he was committed to the Tower. On 28 April he was put on his trial before a special commission at Westminster, along with Prior Houghton and the three Carthusian priors, and pleaded not guilty. He was asked by Lord-chancellor Audeley why he persisted in an opinion condemned by the judgment of so many lords and bishops and of the whole realm in parliament. He replied in an impressive speech that he had intended to keep silence, like our Lord ; but, in discharge of his own conscience and those of others, he would say that he had all the rest of Christendom in favour of his view, besides the testimony of general councils and fathers of the church ; and he was sure that the greater part of England at heart agreed with him. £[e was ordered to say no more. 'Well then/Jle^enlied, 'judge me according to your law.' A jury was summoned next day to try him and the Carthusians, and they were urged in vain to recant. The jury, how- ever, could not agree to condemn them, as their denial of the king's supremacy had not been malicious, and the word ' maliciously ' was in the statutory definition of the crime. But the judges expressly told them that that word in the statute was superfluous, and whoever denied the supremacy did so mali- ciously. Still the jury declined to find them guilty till Cromwell threatened that, if they did not convict, they would be in danger themselves. A verdict of guilty was then brought in, and sentence pronounced. Rey- nolds begged the judges to obtain for him two or three days to prepare for death ; this, they told him, rested entirely with the king. He obtained his desire. On 4 May, in com- pany with the three Carthusians and John Hale, he was dragged through the Tower to Tyburn, where they were all executed with special barbarity and — what was unprece- dented— in their ecclesiastical habits, without having been degraded.

He afterwards moved to Trinity College, and commenced M.A. in 1553. He seems to have studied medicine, and on 14 March 1567 received permission to pro- ceed M.D. ; but instead of being admitted he went with testimonial letters from the university to Russia. On his return <he took holy orders, and was presented by the queen to the rectory of Stapleford- Abbots, Essex, 7 Aug. 1568. Subsequently, on 24 May 1569, he became, in addition, rector of Lambourne in the same county, and practised physic. In 1571 he was examined by the College of Physicians and declared to be ignorant and unlearned. He voluntarily confessed that he had practised physic for two years, and the college ordered his imprisonment until he paid a fine of 20/. From 2 May 1578 till 1584 Reynolds in- creased his preferments by holding the vicarage of West Thurrock, Essex. A summons to appear before Bishop Aylmer in St. Paul's Cathedral, 25 Aug. 1579, to answer some charge of irregularity, was delivered to him there ; but he assaulted the process- server, and was committed to the Marshal- ea prison. He petitioned the privy council for pardon later in the same year. He held the other two Essex livings until his death, which took place shortly before 20 Dec. 1606. He was author of: 1. 'A. Booke called Reynolds 69 Reynolds the Foundacion of Rhetorike, because all other Partes of Rhetorike are grounded thereupon,' &c., imprinted by Jhon King- ston, 4to, 1563, dedicated to Lord Robert Dudley.

His mother, Hester, was a daughter.'of George Conyars, by Dorothy Bushel, formerly maid of honour to Queen Henrietta Maria. A grand-uncle, Richard Reynolds, was slain at Carlisle, fighting on the royalist side, in 1644. There was thus a family tradition of loyalty to the Stuarts. After private education at Moulton and Peterborough, Reynolds became pensioner of Sidney-Sussex College on 31 Dec.

Article: Soft composite metal powder and method to produce same

ABSTRACT

Disclosed is a composite metal powder made from a base iron powder milled with an alloying component such as nickel, copper, managnese, chromium, silicon, phosphorus, boron, vanadium, and molybdenum, where the composite metal powder has a compressibility comparable to the compressibility of the soft base iron powder prior to milling. Such a composite is obtained by using a short mill time followed by an annealing step.
This invention relates to powder metallurgy and, more specifically, to a new composite metal powder made from a base iron powder and an alloying component where the composite metal powder has a compressibility similar to the base iron powder prior to forming the composite and the alloying component is embedded in the base iron powder.
Compressibility is a standard measurement described in ASTM B 331, "Compressibility of Metal Powder in Uniaxial Compaction", and is a measure of the density achieved when pressing a powder into a die at a specified pressure. The higher the compressibility the lower energy needed to produce a powder metal part and the denser the part will be. Among other characteristics, it measures the hardness of the powder.
Metal powders are used in powder metallurgy to form hardened metal objects such as gears and rods by first pressing the powder in a die and then heating the compacted metal powder to form a coherent mass. The heating step is referred to as sintering. Sintering is typically defined as the bonding of particles in a mass of metal powder by molecular or atomic attraction through the application of heat at a temperature below the melting point of the metal.
 Conventionally, metal powders used in powder metallurgy are either an alloy metal powder which has been milled to the point of saturation hardness or a loose mixture of two or more individual metal powders. Loose mixtures of individual metal powders are formed by the manufacturer who buys the individual metal powders. The loose mixture is formed using a conventional mixing apparatus. Such loose mixtures of metal powders have poor dispersion of the alloying component and oxidation of the alloying component occurs prior to formation of the part. U.S. Pat. No. 3,785,801 issued Jan. 15, 1974 to J. S. Benjamin and all of its progeny teach the formation of alloy metal powder by prolonged milling of two or more metal powders. Typically, the milling period exceeds 48 hours. The alloy metal powder so produced has typically reached saturation hardness. Saturation hardness is a hardness value which does not increase with increased milling time. The use of such a hardened alloy metal powder produces a greater amount of wear on the die stock than using a mixture of soft base iron and alloy component. Additionally, such a hardened alloy metal powder does not produce as dense a part as the mixture of soft iron and alloy component.
 Applicant has now discovered, quite unexpectedly, that by milling a mixture of base iron powder with an alloying component for a short period of time to form an intermediate milled product and then annealing the intermediate milled product, a composite metal powder is produced that has a compressibility similar to that of the base iron powder. It has also been found that the composite metal powder of the present invention has a good dispersion of the alloying component in the base iron powder, and is advantageous to use in the powder metallurgy process of forming hardened objects.
It is important that a good dispersion of the alloying component is obtained in the base iron powder in order to obtain a homogeneous hardened object. It has also been found that the dispersion is such with the metal composite of the present invention that it prevents separation of components in the powder state. This is also an important aspect in order to obtain an homogeneous hardened object.
Having a compressibility similar to the compressibility of the base iron powder means that the composite metal powder of the present invention produces a denser part before sintering than conventional alloy metal powders. In fact, it has been found that the compressibility of the metal powder composite of the present invention is similar to the compressibility of the base iron powder. Having such a high degree of compressibility means that the composite metal powder of the present invention decreases the wear on the compressing dies and increases the life of the dies used in the process of forming the hardened object. This provides an economic advantage to the user of the metal composite powder of the present invention.
 Yet another advantage of the present invention is that the alloying component is embedded in and often fully encapsulated in the soft base iron powder. This protects the alloying component from oxidation. This embedding aspect is also thought to aid in preventing separation of the components in the composite metal powder.
Broadly, the method of the present invention entails milling a base iron powder with an alloying component for a sufficient period of time to embed the alloying component in the base iron powder thereby forming an intermediate milled product and subsequently annealing the intermediate milled product to form a composite metal powder having compressibility similar to the compressibility of the base iron powder.
The base iron powder can be mixed with the alloying component prior to its addition to the mill or the base iron powder and alloying component can be added individually to the mill. Premixing is preferred.
 Milling of the base iron powder and the alloying component to produce the intermediate milled product of the present invention can be conducted in any conventional mill used in the powder metallurgy field that produces an intermediate milled product that can be annealed to form the composite metal powder of the present invention. Dry, intensive, high energy milling used in the present invention is not restricted to any type of apparatus. Typically, a high energy ball type mill is used such as a stirred ball mill, a shaker ball mill, a vibrating ball mill or a planetary ball mill. An attritor can be used. An attritor is a high energy ball mill in which the powder charge is agitated by an impeller located therein. The motion to the balls is imparted by the impeller. Good results have been obtained with a vibrating ball mill of the type sold under the tradename SPEX shaker mills.
When using a mill that employs balls, a ball to powder weight ratio of about 5:1 to about 50:1 can be used. Good results have been obtained when using a ball to powder weight ratio of about 10:1.
The atmosphere inside the mill should be controlled and preferably the atmosphere inside the mill is a non-oxidizing atmosphere. Good results have been obtained with an atmosphere of inert gas such as nitrogen, helium, or argon, with argon being preferred.
The milling temperature should be ambient. Due to the heat generated by the moving powder and balls, typically the mill is jacketed and provided with a cooling medium to maintain the temperature at ambient.
 Typically, the milling process is a batch operation where the components are milled, recovered from the mill, and screened for size. The intermediate milled product that does not meet the size criteria is recycled.
The time of the milling will vary depending on the parameters of the type of milling process used and the amount of base iron powder and alloying component in the mill. Using a SPEX shaker mill with 100 grams of 1/4-inch diameter steel balls with a ball to powder ratio of 10:1 by weight operated at 1200 cycles per minute for a period of between about 40 to 60 minutes produces good results. The milling period in such an operation can be for about 15 to about 90 minutes and more preferred about 20 to 80 minutes with a most preferred mill time of about 40 to about 60 minutes.
Using a vertical attritor mill operated at an impeller speed of 60 rpm and containing a ball load of 1/4-inch diameter steel balls weighing 15 Kg, and a weight ratio of balls:powder being about 10:1, a period of about 4 to about 8 hours produces good results.
The milling period is best determined by microscopic inspection of milled product to determine when the milled mixture of base iron powder and alloying component has formed an intermediate milled product that can be annealed to form the composite metal powder of the present invention.
 Typically the particles of base iron powder and alloying component when initially introduced into the mill are flattened when initially milled. The intermediate milled product of the present invention has particles that are rounded in shape. Milling of the flat plate-like particles is continued until a rounded intermediate milled particle is produced that has the alloying component embedded in the base iron matrix and more preferably until the alloying component is fully encapsulated in the base iron matrix. The milling period has lasted too long when the rounded composite has fractures appearing therein and starts to work harden excessively. The process is discontinued when the rounded particles are produced and fracturing of the particles appears to be beginning. The alloying component particles in the composite is readily detectable by optical means. Subsequent milling, if allowed to proceed past this point, results in extensive fracturing and finer particles sizes in the powder as the material rapidly work hardens. If allowed to continue for several hours, a mechanical alloyed product would result, and saturation hardness of the powder would occur.
The milling period lasts long enough to embed the alloying component particles into the soft base iron matrix and more preferably until the alloying component particles are fully encapsulated in the soft base iron powder.
 After milling, the intermediate milled product is subjected to an annealing step. Annealing is a process whereby the intermediate milled product is heated to a temperature of between about 500° C. to about 1000° C. for a period between about 8 hours to about 5 minutes in an inert atmosphere. Such annealing removes any work hardening that occurred to the intermediate milled product and produces a soft composite metal powder that has a compressibility similar to the compressibility of the soft base iron matrix prior to milling.
The milling step lasts too long when the annealing step cannot produce a composite with a compressibility similar to the compressibility of the base iron matrix.
The annealing step is carried out using conventional equipment. Preferably, an inert atmosphere is used in the annealing chamber. Preferably an inert gas or vacuum is used. More preferably the atmosphere is hydrogen gas.
The length of the annealing step is inversely proportional to the annealing temperature. At about 1000° C. about 5 minutes are needed, at about 500° C. about 6 hours are needed. Preferably the annealing step is run at about 850° C. for about 30 minutes.
The compressibility of the composite of the present invention is similar to the compressibility of the base iron powder prior to its addition to the mill. If the composite's hardness is too much higher than the base iron powder, then the composite, although useful in powder metallurgy, will produce low density green parts and not be the product of the present invention. Preferably the compressibility of the composite of the present invention is substantially similar to that of the base iron powder.
 When the composite metal powder of the present invention has a similar compressibility to the base iron powder, the ratio of compressibility of composite metal powder to compressibility of base iron powder is equal to or greater than about 95% (compressibility of composite metal powder/compressibility of base iron). Preferably the ratio of compressibility of the composite metal powder to base iron powder is substantially similar, i.e. equal to or greater than about 98%.
This invention produces a suitable composite metal powder for use in pressing and sintering low alloy steel parts. The composite metal powder of the present invention comprises a soft iron matrix or base iron powder with alloying component particles grossly dispersed therein, but not alloyed, throughout the base iron matrix. The composite metal powder has compressibility similar to that of the soft iron powder which is much softer than pre-alloyed or mechanically alloyed metal powders. The composite of the present invention has the alloying component contained, at least in part, in the interior of the base iron powder, thereby protecting the alloying component from unfavorable atmospheres. This permits the use of conventional alloys such as manganese and chromium which are not presently enjoying wide application. Additionally, the method of the present invention prevents the segregation that is experienced when using elemental blends of powdered metals. Also, pressing dies are protected from wear caused by hard alloy particles, thereby decreasing the wear on the dies.
The alloying components suitable for use in the present invention include nickel, copper, manganese, chromium, silicon, phosphorus, boron, vanadium and molybdenum.
One or more of the alloying components can be added to make the composite metal powder of the present invention.
 The amount of each alloying component used to prepare the composite metal powder of the present invention will vary depending on the desired proportions of each alloying component in the final product. Typically, the composite metal powder of the present invention will be prepared having less than about 2% by weight phosphorus, less than about 10% by weight silicon, less than about 1% by weight boron, less than about 2% by weight vanadium, less than about 2% by weight molybdenum, less than about 10% by weight manganese, and less than about 12% by weight of chromium.
The exact proportions can be such that the composite metal powder of the present invention has a composition comparable to commercial steel such as steel designed by AISI-SAE designations 41XX and 51XX. The 41XX steel series generally has about 0.5% to 1.0% Maganese, 0.8% to 1.1% chromium and about 0.15% to 0.25% molybdenum, the percents being by weight. The 51XX steel series generally has between about 0.8 to 1.05% by weight chromium and 0.6% to 0.9% Manganese.
Any conventional source of the alloying component can be used.
The base iron powder used in the present invention can be from any conventional source. Typically, the base iron powder is made up of about 98% iron and about 0.2% carbon. Like the alloying components, the exact make-up of the base iron powder component can vary depending on the desired finished compound. Preferably the base iron powder is low in carbon, having a carbon content of less than about 0.1% by weight and an iron content of about 99% by weight and above.
 The particle size of the alloying component and the base iron powder prior to addition to the mill should be less than about 60 mesh; and preferably in the range of about 100 mesh to about 325 mesh. Good results have been obtained with an alloying component having a particle size of about 60 mesh by down and a base iron powder having a particle size of about 100 mesh by down.
It will be understood by those of skill in the art that some size reduction will naturally occur due to the milling process.
The present invention may be more fully understood by the following examples.
EXAMPLE 1

To 10 grams of soft iron powder of 99+% iron content and 0.8% carbon, 0.18 grams of ferrochrome alloy containing 56% chrome, 7% carbon, 3% silicon, and 0.1 grams of high-carbon ferromanganese containing 80% manganese and 6.5% carbon was mixed. These powders were added to a SPEX vibrating ball mill which had been purged with argon and the mill sealed with an argon atomosphere. The mill was operated for forty minutes with 1/4-inch steel balls in a ball to powder ratio of 10:1. Upon discharge the milling had produced flowable iron powder with the alloying components dispersed as small particles throughout and completely embedded in the soft iron metal matrix. A flowable composite powder with a rounded morphology was produced.

The charge to the mill was reduced iron powder, ferrochromium and ferromanganese to obtain a composition of 98% by weight iron, 1% by weight chromium and 0.8% by weight manganese. A ball to powder ratio of 10:1 was employed. The milling was conducted in an argon atmosphere.

An inert atmosphere of nitrogen was employed. Samples of the powder were removed after time intervals of 4, 8 and 16 hours. These samples were then annealed in hydrogen for 30 minutes at 850° C. Compressibility tests were then made at 100 Ksi with the following results:

Hoffman of Winchester, Va., was downed in the Shenandoah river, near Strasburg, last week. We read a good deal in the papers of stylish turnout in Washington. Butler’s turnout, though not stylish, has been much admired.— Arcadian. J. R. Christian, editor of the Sparta (Ga) Times and Planter, was shot on Tuesday by F. A. Butts. Butts went into Christian’s office and insulted him whereupon Christian knocked him down. Butts arose and drawing a pistol shot Christian through the arm. The quantity of tobacco sold in the various warehouses in Danville, Va., during the half year beginning October 1, 1874, and ending March 30, 1875, was 7,186,888 pounds, which brought $2,526,051.51, an average of nearly 22 cents per pound. From the late report of the Comptroller of the Currency it appears that the aggregate of the loans and discounts of the National Banks is $851,744,432. In September, 1873, it was $944,220,116, and during the panic it fell to $880,000,000. The aggregate deposits foot up $647,607,625, as against $622,685,563 in September, 1873. From these figures it appears that the floating Capital of the country has been augmenting of late. The West Virginia Capital Question. —Governor Jacob, of West Virginia, the Wheeling Intelligencer says, will pay no attention to the injunction against the removal of the State capital from Charleston to Wheeling, and will order the archives to be immediately transferred to the latter place. The citizens of Wheeling on Monday decided, by a vote of 1,813 to 316, to appropriate $100,000 for a capital building. A dispatch from Fort Laramie, Wyoming, says that Capt. Mix's company of the second cavalry, who were sent after the missing party at Harney's Peak, have secured the whole of them, consisting of sixteen men, one woman and a boy. Heavy snows were reported in the Black Hills, and high water everywhere through that section. A war party of Sioux and Arrapahoes are reported to have left the Shohone country. Scipio Bryan and Elijah Atkinson, both colored, were hanged at Beauford, South Carolina, on the 17th, for the murder in June, 1874, of a clerk of a county store and the burning of the store after robbing it. About five thousand persons witnessed the hanging. Both murderers made full confessions. A colored murderer was also suspended in Louisiana after a full confession. Travis Harris, who murdered Squire Masterson, his father-in-law, at Commerce, Mo., on the third of November last, was hanged at that place on the 17th. A German paper gives the following statistics: Pius IX., during his twenty years' reign, has created ninety-nine cardinals: December 26, 1840, two, June 12, 1847, four of whom Antonelli is the oldest cardinal created by the present Pope; January 17, 1846, one; September 30, 1849, fourteen; March 15, 1852, four; March 7, 1853, eight; December 17, 1855, four; June 10, 1857, six; March 15, 1857, seven; June 25, 1858, one; September 27, 1801, seven; March 10, 1803, seven; December 21, 1863, one; June 22, 1873, live; March 13, 1875, six. Of these ninety-nine cardinals created by Pius IX., fifty-seven are Italians, thirteen French, three English, nine Spanish, three Portuguese, seven German or Austrian, three Hungarian, two Polish, one Belgian and one American; fifty of the ninety-one are already dead. Only eight of the sixty-one who saw Pius IX. mount the Papal throne are still living so that the total number of cardinals is now fifty-seven, of whom the most aged is Cardinal de Angeis, archbishop of Fermo, born April 10, 1792, and who is consequently four weeks older than the Pope himself. The Chicago Times has been gathering information from all parts of the Northwest in relation to the wheat crop of that section, which gives hopeful promise of bountiful harvests. The acreage planted in winter wheat is everywhere quite as large and in some sections larger than usual. The heavy snowfalls in the Northwest have protected the sprouting crops from the rigor of an unusually cold winter, so that comparatively a small portion of the grain planted has been frost-killed. A similar condition of the wheat crop was recently reported from Kentucky, where during the cold weather of February and March the young crop was safely incrusted in a thick coat of glossy ice. Both in the Northwest and in the more central of the Western States the opening spring finds the wheat fields covered with a hardy stand of wheat, with an ordinary favorable growing season, will produce good harvests. The acreage planted and preparing to be planted in spring wheat seems generally to be larger than usual. The constant drain of gold from California to the Eastern cities is causing some remark in San Francisco. The high gold premium is said by correspondents to be the reason, as it leads everyone who has control of any of the precious metal to send it East for sale. At the beginning of this month about $1,000,000 a week was in this way being taken out of circulation in San Francisco, and as gold and silver are the current coin there in fact as well as in theory, the reduction in the amount of the circulating medium was causing much inconvenience to merchants and business men. The fountain to be presented by the actress Lotta to the city of Sail Francisco is now in process of construction in Philadelphia. It is to be of iron, eleven feet in width at the base and sixteen feet in height, with a bronze lamp six feet high surmounting it. The lam)) is to he lighted by means of electricity- On the base of the fountain will be placed three finely executed bronze medallions, representing “Commerce,’' “Agriculture” and “Mining.” A fourth will bear the following inscription : “Presented to the city of San Francisco by Lotta, 1875.” The standing committee of the diocese of Kentucky has given its consent to the conse cration of Rev. Dr. Jagger as bishop of south ern Ohio. The standing committee of South Carolina also consent to the consecration of Bishop Jagger, but refuses to consent to Dr. DeKoren’s. An unknown man walked into a planning mill on Bank street, New York, Saturday af ternoon, and while the machinery was in mo tion suddenly jumped into it and was cut up in pieces before it could be stopped. The mu tilated fragments were swept up and taken to the station-house. ‘•I don’t care much about the bugs,’’said Warm ley, to the head of a genteel boarding house, ‘‘but the fact is madam, I haven’t the blood to spare; you see that yourself.” Every man who mails a package subject to the new postage rates drops it inti© the hole with a wish that Senator Hamlin had to sit for two hours on a hot shovel. “Don’t call on me for three days,” is what an Ashland girl posted on the front gate, and further added: “I’m going to eat some onions this week if I never have another beau,” Judge Donolme, in the Supreme Court Chambers at New York, has granted a writ of error enabling counsel for Wm.

The most popular of the hymns sung by Sankey the vocal partner of Moody, the revivalist, has this chorus: “Hold the fort, for I am coming, Jesus signals still; Wave the answer back to heaven; By thy grace we will.” The second trial in Providence, Rhode Island, to elect a Senator and nine Representatives in the General Assembly resulted in the choice of the regular Republican ticket, supported by the liquor interest by 350 majority. This probably secures the election of Henry Lippit to the office of Governor and the repeal of the prohibitory and State constabulary laws.

Report to Government Shows That There Are 11,713,228 Phones in Country. BY CHAS. S. HAYDEN. (Staff Correspondent.) WASHINGTON. March 18.- KnouRh telephones were in use in the country in 1917 to provide one for every other family. This fact is revealed in a preliminary report on the telephone industry, which reveals the period from 1911 to 1912. To 1917, shows that at the end of the latter year there were 1,713,000 telephones in use, or one to every one persons, and it is estimated that during that year the telephone operators answered 1,842,000,000 calls. The statistics are complete for all lines of the Bell system and associated companies, independent lines and even rural lines reporting less than $5,000 annual income. They do not, however, include data from telephone lines operated by steam and electric railway for their roads, or private lines in hotels, factories, etc., nor those operated by federal, state nor municipal offices. The report shows that although there was an increase in the amount of business and number of companies operating for the five-year period, the mileage increase was not so great nor was the number of new phones installed corresponding increased during the five-year period. During the five-year period, the number of systems or companies increased from 32,1 to 50, or at the rate of 5.5 percent as against 40. A percent for the preceding five-year period was an increase of 2.5 percent for 1907-12. This increase of telephone service increased from 8,729,000 to 11,713,000, or an increase of 34.2 percent as against a 42 percent increase. The number of messages carried increased from 1,737,000 to 21,842,000, all increase of 1.5 percent as compared with 20 percent during the period. H0.-1-. The income from all sources during 1917 amounted to $11,471,947.92, an increase of $5.5 per cent over 1918, while the expenses and fixed charges were $110,293 or 66.6 per cent more than for the report of 1918. The number of telephone operators during 1917 was 2,822, an increase of 43.2 per cent, while the wages aggregated $175,685,286, an increase of $3,826,851. The system in which controlled the per cent of the telephones, $3,831,853, and the value in addition to its own mileage, the Bell system connects with 3,814,853 independently owned telephone lines and therefore, according to the statistics of the census bureau, provides connection with 80.6 per cent of all the telephones in the country.

If You Pay Less Than the Saxon "Six" Price Don't Expect to Get Saxon "Six" Quality That headline tells the truth smooth-running quality car, buy and nothing but the truth. Saxon "Six." If you've got your mind on Saxon "Six" quality and your eye on some car that is selling for $100 or $200 less, you're in a bad fix. You'll have to pass up one or the other. And our advice is, "don't pass up quality for the sake of a little saving in the purchase price." If you want a cheap car why don't you go the limit and get a real cheap one and save $400 or $500? If you want a good car, a finely built, wonderful performing, suppose you do pay $100 or $200 more for Saxon "Six" than for some other car. You'll get it back many times over in the better service Saxon "Six" will give you. And not only better service but longer service. It's a quality light-six. It's honestly built without a bit of cheapness anywhere. That's why we can't sell it for a cent less than its present price. Ride just once in Saxon "Six." Then you'll know why it is worth more.

Article: What is meant by "scale family of densities"?
I was wondering what the exact definition of this is. Apparently the exponential distribution is an example of such a family of densities. But what is the precise definition of a scale family? Also, I've heard of location and location-scale families in the same context and I'm not sure what these are either.

Definition 3.5.4 from Casella & Berger:

Let $f(x)$ be any pdf. Then for any $\sigma >0$, the family of pdfs $(1/\sigma) f(x/\sigma)$, indexed by the parameter $\sigma$, is called the scale family with standard pdf $f(x)$ and $\sigma$ is called the scale parameter of the family.


+1.  I am surprised, though, that C&B chose such a narrow definition.  We could let $F$ be any distribution, continuous or not, and define the associated scale family as the set of distributions given by $F(x/\sigma), \sigma\gt 0$.

A total of 184.2 grams of the aforesaid starting powders were mixed together in a V-type mixer with a view to obtaining an alloy having a target composition of 30.0% Nd-3.6% Dy-47.7% Fe-17.5% Co-1.12% B (by weight %) (14.0% Nd-1.5% Dy-57.5% Fe-20% Co-7.0% B (by atomic %)). The resulting mixture was then compacted, and was charged in a vessel made of stainless steel. After the vessle had been placed in a muffle furnace, the temperature within the vessel through which an argon gas flow was fed increased. The furnace was kept constant at 1150° C. for 3 hours, and was then cooled off to room temperature. The thus obtained reduction reaction product was coarsely pulverized to 8 mesh-through, and was thereafter charged in 10 liter of ion-exchanged water, in which calcium oxide (CaO), CaO-2CaCl₂ and unreacted calcium residue contained in the reaction product were in turn converted into calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂) to disintegrate the reaction product and put it into a slurried state. After one hour-stirring, the slurry was allowed to stand for 30 minutes in a stationary manner to discharge the formed calcium hydroxide suspension, followed by re-pouring of water. In this manner, the steps of stirring-stationary holding-removal of suspension were repeated plural times. The Nd-Dy-Fe-Co-B base alloy powder separated and obtained in this manner was dried in vacuum to obtain 84 grams of the invented rare earth alloy powder of 20 to 300 microns suitable for magnet materials.
 As a result of a component analysis, the obtained alloy powder was found to have a desired composition of:

Fe: 48.2 wt %,

Co: 15.8 wt %,

B: 1.1 wt %,

Ca: 800 ppm,

O₂ : 4100 ppm, and

C: 670 ppm.
In consequence of a measurement of X-ray diffraction pattern, the obtained alloy powder was found to include as the major phase 95% or higher of an intermetallic compound of a R(Fe,Co)B tetragonal type structure in which a=8.76 Å, and c=12.15 Å.
The powder was finely pulverized to a mean particle size of 2.50 microns, and was compacted at a pressure of 1.5 t/cm² in a magnetic field of 10 kOe. Thereafter, the compact was sintered at 1120° C. for 2 hours in an Ar flow, and was aged at 600° C. for 1 hour to prepare a permanent magnet sample.
The sample was found to exhibit excellent magnet properties as expressed in term of Br=11.5 kG, iHc=16.3 kOe and (BH)max=31.7 MGOe.
The coefficient of temperature of Br of this alloy magnet (between 25° C. and 100° C.; the same shall hereinafter apply.) was expressed in terms of α=0.075%/°C.

A manner of producing permanent magnets by using alloy powders obtained by reducing rare earth oxides has been known in the art of Sm-Co magnets. However, the Sm-Co alloy powders require a high reduction temperature of 1150°-1300° C. whereby undesirable crystal grain growth is induced, difficulty in obtaining a powder with a uniform particle size upon distingration is caused, and the reaction vessel is seriously damaged through the reaction.
Ground or waste powders resulting from the machining procedure for the ultimate magnet products of the sintered alloy may be used as the starting material for the reducing reaction, too.
It should be understood that modifications may be made without departing from the gist of the present invention as disclosed in the entire disclosure and claimed hereinbelow.

R. Johnston1* Correlative imaging provides a method of investigating complex systems by combining analytical 
(chemistry) and imaging (tomography) information across dimensions (2D-3D) and scales 
(centimetres-nanometres). We studied weathering processes in a modern cryptogamic ground cover 
from Iceland, containing early colonizing, and evolutionary ancient, communities of mosses, lichens, 
fungi, and bacteria. Targeted multi-scale X-ray Microscopy of a grain in-situ within a soil core revealed 
networks of surficial and internal features (tunnels) originating from organic-rich surface holes. Further targeted 2D grain characterisation by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDS), following an intermediate manual 
correlative preparation step, revealed Fe-rich nodules within the tunnels. Finally, nanotomographic 
imaging by focussed ion beam microscopy (FIB-SEM) revealed coccoid and filamentous-like structures 
within subsurface tunnels, as well as accumulations of Fe and S in grain surface crusts, which may 
represent a biological rock varnish/glaze. We attribute these features to biological processes. This 
work highlights the advantages and novelty of the correlative imaging approach, across scales, 
dimensions, and modes, to investigate biological weathering processes. Further, we demonstrate 
correlative microscopy as a means of identifying fingerprints of biological communities, which could 
be used in the geologic rock record and on extra-terrestrial bodies. Colonization of the land by plants and other organisms during the early Palaeozoic (~ 500 ­Ma1) was fundamen-
tal to the evolution of terrestrial landscapes. The expansion of primordial vegetation had an influential effect 
on the architecture and evolution of river and sedimentary ­systems2,3, weathering and soil ­development4–6, 
and crucially the drawdown of atmospheric ­CO2 through organic carbon burial and ­weathering7,8. The first 
plant-dominated biospheres were akin to modern cryptogamic ground covers (CGCs)4,9,10, which are composed 
of a consortia of early divergent and evolutionary ancient non-vascular bryophyte plants (mosses, liverworts, 
hornworts), lichens, fungi, algae, and bacteria. At the modern day, CGCs are present in a variety of habitats 
ranging from deserts to polar ­tundra11–13, and often are the pioneering organisms of bare land surfaces before 
the vascular plants. Modern CGCs are considered suitable analogues for early terrestrial biotas because of the 
similarity between the modern and ancient plant components (cryptophytes) and the relationships that they 
developed with other ­organisms4,10,14. Importantly, symbioses between plants and fungi (e.g. mycorrhizae) and 
between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria (e.g. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports Scientific Reports |        (2021) 11:12736 Correlative Microscopy: a tool

l i 3D multi‑scale imaging of soil core, subsurface segmentation, and grain (digital) isolation. 3D 
tomographic imaging of a CGC soil micro-core was achieved using the ZEISS Scout-and-Zoom workflow on a 
ZEISS Xradia 520 Versa XRM (Fig. 1). From initial whole-core scans (Fig. 1a, b), progressively higher magni-
fication and resolution (i.e. smaller voxel sizes) in subsequent scans (Fig. 1c) enabled us to identify, target and 
image a ~ 300 µm diameter in-situ volcanic scoria grain from the central subsurface region of the micro-soil core 
(Supplementary Videos S1-2). The scans revealed that the grain has both surficial and internal features of interest 
visible to a voxel size of less than 1 µm (Fig. 1d, e, Supplementary Videos S3-4). Following segmentation of the 
grain and its internal features, these resolved into a) networks of branched and sometimes interconnected tun-
nels of varying morphologies and characteristics (Figs. 1e, 2a–f, k–v, Supplementary Video S3), and b) a series of 
holes and troughs on the surface of the grain (Figs. 1d, 2g–j).hf g

g j)
The grain surface features are diverse, representing holes, troughs, and elongate tracks of different orienta-
tions, lengths and shapes (Figs. 2g–j). The tunnels appear to originate from holes at the grain surface (Figs. 1, 
2a, g–j), which extend to varying depths within the grain, and also appear to contain accumulations of organic 
material (Figs. 2g–j), but these are at the limit of resolution of Versa XRM. The individual tunnel networks 
were segmented for volumetric and morphological analyses, and were provided with a specific colour for ease 
of locating them within the grain (Figs. 2a–c). 3D segmentation reveals that the tunnels make up 20% of the 
grain. The tunnel networks appear to fall into two morphological groups: those that are branched (e.g. tunnel 
networks 1, 2 and 5; Figs. 2 k–p) and those that form singular, closed channels (e.g. tunnel networks 4, 7 and 15; 
Figs. 2q–v). Performing morphological analysis from the XRM segmentations reveals that all tunnels range in 
thickness from 3.2 to 13.9 µm (Fig. 2d) and the most voluminous are in the largest, most networked tunnels (e.g. networks 1 and 2; Figs. 2e). The thickness varies throughout each of the networks, however the thickest portion 
is usually at the entrance/exit hole (Figs. 2k–v). Networks also don’t have a particular orientation in the grain 
and are varied across 360° (Fig. 2f). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ these primitive organisms contributed to soil-forming processes, biologically mediated weathering, and potential 
nutrient-acquisition from their substrates.l Previous research on modern CGCs developing on primordial land surfaces from Iceland (i.e. lava flows and 
volcanic sedimentary terrains that are relatively new and unweathered land surfaces devoid of ‘higher’ vascular 
plants) were mostly limited to 2D investigations, mainly of grain surface ­processes21. These revealed biologically-
mediated weathering features (BWFs) on volcanic glass and scoria within soils that were attributed to the actions 
of different organisms (e.g. bacteria, fungi) and processes (e.g. symbiosis, root-mediated dissolution)21. Promi-
nent among these were ‘tunnels’, which are thought to be created by ‘boring’ fungal ­hyphae21–32. These tunnels 
differ from holes that develop naturally as gas-escape vesicles in volcanic ejecta because they generally form 
elongate tubes, are associated with organic material, and are not present in every grain, and the tunnels are gen-
erally much smaller than the vesicles. Here, we develop a novel correlative microscopy workflow across modes, 
dimensions and scales to investigate the physical, chemical and morphological characteristics of these tunnels. Our approach combines optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and chemical 
analysis (SEM–EDS), high resolution X-ray microscopy (tomography) (XRM) and focussed ion beam microscopy 
(FIB-SEM), that are correlated using ZEISS ZEN Connect and Atlas 5 (3D) software. Correlative microscopy has 
the advantage that numerous data types can be acquired and studied in-situ, in unison, and across dimensions, 
therefore providing a holistic approach, and enabling a better understanding of how different parameters (e.g. morphology, chemistry, structure) are linked. This approach is currently a developing application in human-
made materials ­research33–36 and life/biological ­science37–40, and despite a few ­geological41–43 and more recently 
specific soil science ­examples44,45, the method has not been applied to soil weathering and biological interactions. pi

We adopt the following correlative strategy. First, we document the tunnel networks through high resolution 
3D XRM, which provides insights into their 3D morphology and how they might have formed. Second, we show 
how 3D tomography can be correlated with high resolution imaging and chemical data derived from SEM–EDS 
to provide information relating to the tunnel elemental variations and micro-to-nano scale features. Finally, we 
utilise the correlative microscopy workflow to target specific regions of interest for further analysis via FIB-SEM 
and generate nanotomographic volumes, which not only increases resolution (small pixel/voxel sizes) but also 
provides complementary nested 3D information to XRM. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Our aim is to use this correlative approach to char-
acterize weathering, potentially of a biological origin, in modern analogues of early land-plant communities. Our ultimate goal is to develop the use of features on the micro-to-nanometre scale as fingerprints of biological 
community presence and indicators of biologically mediated weathering in the geologic past. Further, we propose 
that this approach could be used in the search for biological influences on extra-terrestrial bodies. R. L. Mitchell1,2,3*, P. Davies1, P. Kenrick2, T. Volkenandt4, C. Pleydell‑Pearce1 &

exceptionally preserved 407 million year old Rhynie chert biota providing many ­examples15–17. It is generally 
regarded that symbionts in the early Palaeozoic were responsible for a portion of the biologically mediated 
weathering via targeted nutrient (elemental) acquisition from soil ­minerals18,19, followed by development of the 
first biologically-mediated ‘proto-soils’13 and eventual global influence on biogeochemical ­cycles19,20. However, 
the mechanisms of weathering in both the modern and ancient examples are poorly understood. Investigating 
the intricate nano-to-micro scale interactions in modern analogous CGCs can shed light on how ancestors of 1Advanced Imaging of Materials (AIM) Facility, College of Engineering, Bay Campus, Swansea University,

l i Thus the tunnel networks can be characterised by their shape, morphology, 
and the way that they branch. Correlation of 2D and 3D datasets and correlative preparation step. The correlative imaging 
workflow enables the combination of 3D and 2D datasets from multiple modes of acquisition. By using advanced 
correlative software (ZEISS ZEN Connect and Atlas 5 (3D)) it is possible to target specific subsurface regions 
or features of interest from the 3D XRM data and expose it through a separate correlative preparation step 
(Figs. 3a–d), allowing further targeted study in 2D (i.e. through SEM imaging, SEM–EDS chemical mapping, 
FIB-SEM, or other techniques not used here; Figs. 3e–f). Subsequent imaging via OM and SEM of the same 
region is overlaid using ZEISS ZEN Connect and combined with 3D XRM data (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Video

exposed volcanic glass grain surface reveals a pseudosymplectite texture (Fig. 4); pseudo refers to the phases in 
this volcanic glass grain which are not true minerals, and symplectite refers to a petrographic microstructure 
with intergrowths of two or more phases where one (or more) phase may be more unstable than the other(s), 
and recrystalises during formation to more stable constituents under changing pressures, temperatures, and/
or interaction with external ­fluids46. Chemical analysis of the grain via SEM–EDS indicates that there are two 
chemically distinct psuedo-mineralogical phases in the symplectite: a brighter grey phase (from SEM greyscale 
imaging) containing Mg, Ca, Fe and Si (interpreted as a Mg-Fe silicate phase), and a darker grey phase (from 
SEM greyscale imaging) containing Al, Na, K, Si and O (interpreted as a feldspathic phase) (e.g. Figures 4f-m, 
p-q). The grain contains large gas-escape vesicles (Fig. Results

2D cross sections through tunnels of two different morphologies were investigated further, hereafter named 
hole types 1 and 2 (Figs. 4f–o). In hole type 1, sections reveal tunnels with a circular to elliptical outline 5–10 µm 
in diameter (Figs. 4f, g–j). Results show that these tunnels cut across the boundaries of the feldspathic and Mg-Fe 
silicate phases. The tunnel outline is smooth and curved, where the rim is bright in the SEM images, which 
appears to be due to the accumulation of heavier elements (Fe; Figs. 4g–i).ht g

These accumulations appear nodulous and are often accompanied by high S but not always (Supplementary 
Data S6). SEM–EDS spot analyses of the nodules indicate that Fe concentrations range between 11 and 32 wt%, S 
is up to 1 wt%, and the average for hole type 1 is between 15 and 20 wt%. The hole type 2 (Figs. 4k–o) morpholo-
gies are irregularly shaped being more elongate and have a diameter of ~ 1–2 µm. They formed entirely within the 
feldspathic (Al, Na, K, Si) phases leaving the Mg-Fe silicate phase intact (Figs. 4k–m). As with hole type 1, they 
contain Fe-rich nodular accumulations on some hole edges (Figs. 4l–m). SEM–EDS spot analysis indicates the 
nodules have Fe concentrations ranging between 17 and 25 wt%, and negligible amounts of S (Supplementary 
Data S6). The average chemical compositions of the Fe nodules in both hole types is higher than the Mg-Fe 
silicate phase of the grain, with a larger variability particularly in hole 1a (Fig. 4o).l p

Reflected OM imaging indicates that there are bright regions on the outside edge of the grain (Fig. 4a) forming 
irregular and non-continuous crusts. Further investigation via SEM indicates that the crusts vary in morphology, 
generally forming 1–2 µm thick surface coatings that are not continuous over the entire grain edge. Some crusts 
also appear as coatings within the larger gas escape vesicles inside the grain (Fig. 4a). The boundary between 
the crust and the grain surface is sometimes abrupt, but often gradational, developing a mixed, transition layer 
(Fig. 4e, p). Results

and S, where Fe is again in higher proportions compared with the ‘background’ Mg-Fe silicate phases of the grain  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92184-1 Scientific Reports |        (2021) 11:12736  | www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Figure 2. 3D analysis of the segmented tunnel networks from the grain of interest.

3D volumetric analysis of tunnels, high resolution 2D imaging with chemical analysis, and the correlation 
of datasets establishes that the holes/tunnel networks studied in Figs. 4f–m, 5i–o belong to tunnel network 2 
(Figs. 6a–c). The variations in morphology between the two types of tunnel (i.e. shape and volume; Figs. 2k–v) 
signify that they might have been formed by different processes; either abiotic and/or biotic. One hypothesis 
could be the abiotic dissolution of easily weatherable mineral phases by acid rain, which is a common atmos-
pheric feature following recent eruptions in ­Iceland47. How much this would affect proto-soil grains in CGCs 
though is unclear, and would be affected by the time the grains were under chemical attack, depth of grains 
within the soil, and their proximity to eruptions. A second hypothesis is that the tunnels formed through abi-
otic chemical dissolution where soil waters, potentially enriched in ­CO2, dissolved easily weatherable minerals. This could be exacerbated by below-ground biological respiration of ­CO2 and exudates from microbes could 
indirectly be responsible for mineral attack and ­dissolution48. 2D imaging (Fig. 4) reveals evidence of hole for-
mation that follows specific localized grain chemistries (hole type 2; Figs. 4k–m) where preferential dissolution 
occurs in the feldspathic phase. This could indicate that these parts of the grain are more ‘easily weatherable’ 
and prone to chemical attack. Interestingly, evidence of biologically mediated feldspar weathering is common 
in the ­literature29,30,49; it is also reported that the presence of feldspars in rocks may increase the susceptibility 
for biological attack by fungi, and that the rock’s original chemistry and mineralogy highly influences these 
physical and biochemical ­effects50,51. This is likely because feldspars contain many of the essential elements (e.g. Ca, Na, K) needed for microorganisms and their symbiotic partners to ­live30,52. Therefore, a third hypothesis 
is that the tunnel formation is due to biological factors. Hole type 1 tunnel morphology cuts across chemical 
boundaries within the grain. This difference might be a factor of time, where hole type 2 morphologies are 
created first and a longer duration of weathering leads to the creation of larger, more rounded and branched 
tunnels (hole type 1). Discussion Our results demonstrate that multi-modal correlative microscopy provides a novel method for understanding 
the multi-scale processes involved in soil weathering, specifically when these processes (e.g. tunnel formation) 
occur in three dimensions. The correlative approach is becoming increasingly used across the ­materials36 and 
­biological38 sciences and has distinct advantages over conventional ‘single mode’ approaches. The correlative 
workflow overcomes the restriction of studying in one scale/dimension/technique alone by combining (layering) 
imaging and other data (e.g., chemical, crystallographic), while also successively improving resolution (Fig. 7, 
Supplementary Videos S1, 2, 5); for example, FIB-SEM pixel (voxel) sizes are vastly smaller than those obtained 
from conventional laboratory XRM instruments (17.3 nm vs 0.81 µm for our results, respectively; Figs. 6b and 
f, Supplementary Methods S7, 10), allowing complementary analysis by bridging micro-to-nano scale features 
with reciprocal context and improving information output (Fig. 6). Studying objects across dimensions and 
scales also reveals characteristics and features which might not otherwise be identified via a single technique 
or in one dimension alone (e.g. the morphology of tunnel networks and the presence of grain crusts). Finally, 
the ability to target specific subsurface regions of the soil grain of interest within a core sample through initial 
‘coarse’ non-destructive 3D XRM imaging (Supplementary Videos S1, 2), subsequent correlative preparation 
steps, and successive combined analytical and imaging approaches enabled the study of a specific object in the 
context of its microenvironment (i.e. the ‘targeted trajectory approach’ ­of36). Correlative imaging thus allows 
us to study the combined 2D and 3D morphological and chemical characteristics of cryptogamic ground cover 
soil and grain weathering.i g

Our findings demonstrate that an assortment of markings are present on the surface of a soil grain of interest. These are reminiscent of the surficial bowls, tramlines, elongate troughs, and internal pore networks previously 
described as biologically mediated weathering features (BWFs) ­by21 that are common in modern CGC soils. Although no microorganisms were observed colonising the grain surface from our XRM scans (the voxel size 
is not small enough to resolve them; Supplementary Methods S10), the presence of these features could suggest Scientific Reports |        (2021) 11:12736  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92184-1  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Figure 7.

Indeed, accumulations of organic material are present within holes and troughs (Figs. 2g–i) 
and surrounding the grain in the soil matrix (Fig. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ with constant diameters and rounded ­ends4,54, sometimes forming anastomosing ‘channels’29. There is a single 3D 
study within garnets describing tunnels as straight and funnel-shaped with rectangular cross sections becoming 
more rounded towards the ­tip26. In 2D, our results match closely with these morphological descriptions from 
the literature, however in 3D our tunnels are not uniform in shape or width (Fig. 2), being neither particularly 
straight nor funnel shaped, questioning whether they can be attributed to fungi, or indeed, to a biological origin. Grain surficial holes/bowls, which represent the openings of subsurface tunnels (Figs. 1, 2), contain accumula-
tions of organic material (Figs. 2g–j) implying intimate connections to living organisms. The tunnels might have 
formed through chemical dissolution by bacterial communities rather than through biomechanical borings by 
fungal hyphae. If this is the case, the feldspathic phase likely weathered first, and the Fe–Mg silicate phase later, 
which creates the difference in tunnel morphologies. Fungal hyphae may have colonised pre-existing cracks or 
fissures in the ­grain50, the presence of which is supported by the identification of surface BWFs likely caused 
by both fungal hyphae and ­bacteria21. So although we cannot be certain what exactly was causing the tunnels, 
we have shown that by taking a correlative, multi-dimensional and multi-scale approach, we have the ability to 
study weathering features in a more holistic way than by one or two techniques alone.i y

FIB-SEM milling reveals potential communities of endolithic microbes evidenced by bacterial-like filaments 
and coccoid-like structures within tunnels (Figs. 5g–h, j–o), subsurface colonisation likely providing protection 
from environmental ­extremes50. Although we cannot be sure what these organisms are from FIB-SEM imaging 
alone, and the lack of evident internal structures, the shape and size suggest they are not fungal hyphae, but could 
be a mix of cyanobacteria-fungi-lichen biofilms, lichenised and non-lichenised fungi, and yeast-like unicellular 
fungi, which commonly form endolithic microbial ­communities5,50,55,56. These organisms might have enhanced 
other forms of biologically mediated weathering through the in-situ secretion of organic acids and other exudates, 
leading to the irregular (non-straight/funnel) shape of the tunnels. Their existence is further supported by the 
presence of Fe-rich nodules in both types of tunnel (Figs. 4g–m). Fe-rich nodules are thought to be indicators of 
fungal hyphae bio-precipitation in modern ­CGCs21, with further occurrences reportedly created by ­lichens57,58, 
­bacteria48, other ­fungi59–61, and iron oxidising ­bacteria62. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The Fe concentration of the nodules is higher than in 
the feldspathic and Mg-Fe silicate phases of the grain (Fig. 4o), indicating a separate source, which could be bio-
logically derived. A biological source could also explain variations in Fe concentration observed in the nodules.h g

The imaging and analysis results presented here demonstrate that some surfaces of the grain of interest are 
covered in a crust of specific and distinctive chemical composition (high Fe and S; Figs. 4, 5). XRM scans show 
some brightening of the surface indicating the presence of higher density material (Fig. 3f). However, because 
the crust thickness (< 2 µm; Fig. 4) overlaps significantly with the voxel size resolution of the scans (0.81 µm), 
it cannot be conclusively segmented, which highlights the need to combine datasets from multiple modalities 
(and resolutions) through correlative microscopy. Our results demonstrate that crust morphology is variable, 
but because of their heavier element chemistry, they appear brighter in SEM and optical imaging, which is a 
phenomenon observed in other ­studies63. The crust chemical composition is distinctly different to the ‘normal’ 
composition of basaltic rocks and glass (Fig. 4), which indicates alternative modes of accumulation and forma-
tion. We discard the possibility that these crusts are due to contamination because a) there is evidence from 
the initial XRM scans, albeit at limited resolution, of bright areas on the outside of the grain; these precede any 
manual preparation, b) pristine grinding papers devoid of any contamination were used during the correlative 
preparation step, and c) the micro-soil core was already set in epoxy resin. One possible explanation could be 
the volcanic source of the grain. Nickel and chromium are common in early formed minerals during volcanic 
eruption, where nickel can be incorporated into the forsterite (Mg end member of olivine) chemical ­structure64. This however seems unlikely as the crusts are localised to grain surfaces and don’t appear to form internally. An alternative hypothesis could be that the patchy formation of the crust on the grain surface could be due to 
localised biological interactions. Various rock varnishes, coatings, weathering rinds and glazes are ­known48,65,66, 
some specifically caused by ­fungi50,66 and epilithic ­lichens50. It is well established that key chemical diagnostic 
features of biologically-mediated rock varnishes, glazes and coatings traditionally includes high accumulations of 
Mn and/or ­Fe48,65,67,68. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ We discard the possibility that these crusts are due to contamination because a) there is evidence from

reminiscent of 2D tunnel structure observed in other ­studies21,28 which are reported as being from a biological 
origin, usually ­fungal53. Fungal tunnels within soil minerals have been explained as a result of dissolution and 
‘boring’ by combined biomechanical forcing and biochemical alteration; the tunnel retains its shape following 
the death and degradation of the ­hyphae27,49,50. Other documented cases of fungal borings of mineral grains 
produce tunnels of variable form, including simple/straight, branched, helical/coiled and ­annulated28,53, often https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92184-1 Scientific Reports |        (2021) 11:12736  | www.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Biomineralization of these elements as surface coatings, varnishes and glazes results from

a variety of microbes including fungi and ­bacteria48,50,58,69. While the crusts outlined here do not have significant 
accumulation of Mn, suggesting that Mn oxidising and reducing bacteria could be absent from this CGC soil 
biosphere, they do have high Fe compared to the background grain chemistry (Fig. 4). Lichenised fungi are 
known to biomineralize Fe-rich minerals on basaltic lava ­flows69 and lichenised cyanobacteria can biomineralize 
Fe hydroxides and clay-coatings to develop rock ­varnishes70,71. Therefore, it could be that our crusts are produced 
by microbial bioprecipitation, potentially by lichenised fungi and/or bacteria. Cr in the crusts could also be due 
to fungi, which can precipitate reduced forms around their ­cells69,72. The presence and formation mechanism 
of these crusts could be via the same processes as the Fe-rich nodules (Fig. 4); the composition of Fe is similar, 
however the nodules appear to lack sufficient proportions of Cr and/or Ni. Although we cannot conclusively state 
that the crusts are formed from biological interactions, it provides a plausible hypothesis based on their morphol-
ogy, chemical composition, the evidence for likely colonisation by fungi and cyanobacteria from grain surface 
BWFs (Figs. 2g–j), the subsurface weathering features, and potential endolithic communities (Figs. 1,2,4,5). g

The imaging and analysis results presented here demonstrate that some surfaces of the grain of interest are 
covered in a crust of specific and distinctive chemical composition (high Fe and S; Figs. 4, 5). XRM scans show 
some brightening of the surface indicating the presence of higher density material (Fig. 3f). However, because 
the crust thickness (< 2 µm; Fig. 4) overlaps significantly with the voxel size resolution of the scans (0.81 µm), 
it cannot be conclusively segmented, which highlights the need to combine datasets from multiple modalities 
(and resolutions) through correlative microscopy. Our results demonstrate that crust morphology is variable, 
but because of their heavier element chemistry, they appear brighter in SEM and optical imaging, which is a 
phenomenon observed in other ­studies63. The crust chemical composition is distinctly different to the ‘normal’ 
composition of basaltic rocks and glass (Fig. 4), which indicates alternative modes of accumulation and forma-

k Fieldwork and soil core collection. CGCs were collected from various localities in Iceland, the core from 
this study sampled from 65 47.688’N, 16 46.384’W (location L1 ­in4). This core contained a mix of organisms 
including mosses (Racomitrum sp., Ceratodon purpureus, Pohlia sp., Polytrichum juniperinum) and unidentified 
lichens. An extensive description of the field site can be found ­in21. The core was cut and mounted in epoxy resin 
for thin section preparation; following this the main soil core was cut down to ~ 1 cm length to enable ease of 
mounting (and improved resolution) in the XRM. X‑ray microscopy (XRM). Micro-soil cores were scanned using a ZEISS Xradia 520 Versa X-ray micro-
scope (XRM) for 3D tomography. The soil micro-core was attached using a cyanoacrylate-based adhesive to the 
end of a ~ 2 cm long pin and mounted onto a ZEISS specimen holder for scanning. Four scans were collected at 
various magnifications and fields of view to utilise the Scout and Zoom feature of the scanner (see Supplemen-
tary Methods S10); the final ‘high resolution’ scan being collected using the phase-enhanced contrast method. The ‘Scout and Zoom’ feature enables multi-scale study within the same regions of interest, enabling simple 
correlation of data at different scales (Supplementary Videos S1, 2). Reconstructed .txm files were converted to 
8bit greyscale 2D .tiff image stacks. Initially, tunnels were identified in a grain of interest from a 2D .tiff stack 
(Supplementary Video S4), which was subsequently segmented to reconstruct the pore structure in 3D (Supple-
mentary Video S3). Segmentation of tunnels was accomplished via the ZEISS ZEN Intellesis machine learning 
module within ZEISS ZEN Blue software v. 2.6; a number of slices from the imaged volume (in this case, 6) were 
manually ‘coloured in’ to reveal the different components within the scan (i.e. tunnels, grain, air) which was then 
applied to the rest of the volume for segmentation. Visualisation and quantification of tunnel thickness, volume 
and theta was achieved using Object Research Systems (ORS) Dragonfly software v. 2020.1. XRM scans and 
Intellesis segmentation were undertaken within the Advanced Imaging of Materials (AIM) Facility at Swansea

microbial exudates. Two types of tunnel were identified: those that form branched networks, and those that are 
more linear and singular. Following exposure of a cross section of the grain of interest through an intermediate 
correlative preparation step, we used optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and ele-
ment mapping (SEM–EDS) to characterise the morphology and chemical characteristics of the tunnels. Results 
revealed micron-scale variations in morphology between the two types of tunnel and Fe-rich nodules within, 
which were probably formed through biological processes. Grain surfaces crusts were also identified. These have 
accumulations and variations in heavier elements (Fe, S), and could represent a type of biological rock varnish/
glaze. Further focused ion beam (FIB-SEM) nanotomographic imaging of both tunnels and crusts not only 
improved resolution (voxel sizes) of small-scale features, but also revealed the presence of probable biological 
filaments and coccoid-like structures within tunnels. The presence of (a) grain surface BWFs, (b) Fe rich probable 
bioprecipitates, and (c) bacterial-like coccoid and filamentous forms within tunnels indicates that biology played 
an important role in the alteration and weathering of the grain. The physical and chemical features outlined here 
could be used as bioindicators to identify biologically mediated weathering in the rock record, and potentially 
on extra-terrestrial bodies. There is a particular need for this to study the interactions between Earth’s earliest 
terrestrial biospheres and their substrates through the Proterozoic to the earliest Palaeozoic, particularly because 
of the disparity of the timing of terrestrialisation between molecular, phylogenetic, and fossil information. Further 
studies should aim to quantify the biological interaction with their substrates (in particular, soil grains) in real 
time and in multiple dimensions to better understand biological weathering and the impact of micro-to-nano 
scale biogeochemical processes on Earth-scale biogeochemical cycles. Conclusionsh This work highlights the advantages and novelty of using multi-scale and multi-dimensional correlative micros-
copy to understand weathering in cryptogamic ground covers (CGCs), allowing targeting of specific sub-surface 
soil regions for further study with complementary techniques. From targeted multi-scale X-ray Microscopy 
(XRM) imaging, we have identified numerous surficial grain features which are analogous to previously described

inverted microscope using ZEISS ZEN Blue software v. 2.6 with ZEN Connect. SEM images and SEM–EDS 
chemical analysis were undertaken on a ZEISS Crossbeam 550 FIB-SEM using Oxford Instruments X-MaxN 
50 and Aztec software. A table illustrating the SEM imaging and data collection modes/analytical set up can be 
found in Supplementary Methods S7. Imaging and analysis occurred within the Advanced Imaging of Materials 
(AIM) Facility at Swansea University (UK). Focussed ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB‑SEM). Nanotomographic volumes were 
collected for subsurface tunnels and surface crusts using a ZEISS Crossbeam 550 gallium (Ga) source focussed 
ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) and Atlas 5 (3D) correlative software v. 5.2.1. The sample 
preparation for nanotomographic milling is as follows: After achieving an eucentric tilt correction, the sample 
stage is tilted to 54° so it is perpendicular to the FIB column. The sample surface is lifted with the stage vertical 
axis to 5 mm working distance where the two columns are in alignment, and then fine-tuned to confirm the FIB 
and SEM beams are at a coincidence point. Once a region of interest (ROI) is set using the overlay function of 
the Atlas 5 (3D) software (in our cases 15 × 15 µm, and 10 × 7 µm; Figs. 5c–o), setup can begin for the nanotomo-
graphic milling run. Firstly, an initial platinum layer is deposited on the overlay area using a gas injection system 
and the 30 kV 700 pA FIB probe. This protects the sample surface from damage by the Ga FIB beam and helps to 
create a cleaner cross section. 3D tracking marks, which facilitate automatic alignment, focus, astigmatism and 
drift correction as well as slice thickness tracking during the run, are milled onto the platinum layer using the 
30 kV 50 pA FIB probe. These tracking marks are then infilled using the carbon gas injection system to provide 
enough contrast between the platinum and the tracking marks. A trench is then milled using the 30 kV 7nA 
FIB probe to produce a cross sectional face to a depth of approximately 15 µm. Finally, a lower energy probe 
is applied to the cross-sectional face using the 30 kV 700 pA FIB probe for more precision and lower interac-
tion volume. Methods
Fi ld
k Following the identification of a 
subsurface object of interest (in our case, the weathered grain) preparations can be made to expose the object 
for further study via a preparation stage. In this step, a ‘targeted slice’ was chosen from the XRM data, and from 
that a known amount of sample surface material (measured using the XRM scan images) can be removed. This 
is achieved via grinding and polishing of the sample ­surface73, and in our case, 574 µm (Fig. 3) needed to be 
removed to expose the targeted region. For ease of material removal, the soil micro-core was mounted in con-
ductive Bakelite using an ATM Opal 410 mounting press, and subsequently ground and polished using sequen-
tially finer grinding papers (320–600–1200–4000 grit). The resin block was frequently measured using a Hilka 
digital calliper to ensure the correct thickness of sample was removed. Further details on this manual correlative 
sample preparation method can be found ­in73. Our results were within 20 µm of the targeted slice (i.e., 554 µm 
was removed), so a new XRM slice was chosen for the following image correlation to match the newly exposed 
surface (Fig. 3); this 20 µm variation was likely due to the limited resolution of the digital calliper (10 µm). The 
newly exposed grain surface, still set in the Bakelite resin block, was coated with ~ 10 nm thickness of carbon 
using an Agar Scientific coater (Cressington, UK) for subsequent SEM imaging and analysis. This process was 
undertaken within the Advanced Imaging of Materials (AIM) Facility at Swansea University, UK. Correlative microscopy–correlating datasets. 3D XRM data was initially loaded into ZEISS Atlas 5 
(3D) software v. 5.2.1 installed on the ZEISS Crossbeam 550 FIB-SEM within the Advanced Imaging of Materi-
als (AIM) Facility at Swansea University (UK). From there, once the specific amount of sample surface material 
had been removed to expose the object of interest via the correlative preparation step, imaging and data derived 
from SEM, SEM–EDS and OM were correlated manually using ZEISS ZEN Blue software v. 2.6 and the ZEISS https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92184-1 Scientific Reports |        (2021) 11:12736  |  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ ZEN Connect module, enabling a variety of datatypes to be overlain (Supplementary Video S5). From this, tar-
geted FIB-SEM study was carried out utilising the combined 2D/3D approach in ZEISS Atlas 5 (3D) correlative 
software. Optical light microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive 
X‑ray spectroscopy (EDS). Methods
Fi ld
k The cross-sectional face is subsequently repeatedly milled (using the 30 kV 700 pA FIB probe) 
and imaged (using the SEM SESI detector with 1.8 kV pA beam) to create individual images (or slices; 10 nm 
thick) which can later be reconstructed into a 3D volume. Voxel sizes for each run include 17.3 × 17.3 × 10 nm 
for trench 1, and 27.5 × 27.5 × 10 nm for trench 2. Further image collection parameters can be found in Supple-
mentary Methods S7. After a run of ~ 10 h, the image stack is aligned using the Fiji/ImageJ plugin ­StackReg74 
and cropped in three dimensions using the Fiji/ImageJ plugin Crop3D to remove unwanted redeposition occa-
sionally occurring on the edges of the imaged area. All 3D volumes (Figs. 5, 6) were visualised/rendered in ORS 
Dragonfly v. 2020.1. All of the above methods were conducted within the Advanced Imaging of Materials (AIM) 
Facility at Swansea University, UK. Data availability statement Data availability statement y

Article: Is there any direct way to get the address of a vtable at compile time?
I am debugging a pernicious memory corruption error, where it looks like a pointer to a vtable is getting corrupted. I would like to detect when it happens by comparing the value of the pointer to the correct value of the pointer (true location of the vtable) at various points in my program.
Unfortunately, I have not found a way to obtain the correct value of the pointer at compile time, so I have been forced to instantiate a new object just for the sake of reading off its vtable pointer, which seems unnecessarily hacky.
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <stdint.h>

class Foo {
    virtual void performVirtualAction() {
        std::cout << "Foo's version" << std::endl;
    }
};
class Bar : public Foo {
    virtual void performVirtualAction() {
        std::cout << "Bar's version" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main(){
    Foo foo;
    Bar bar;

    std::cout << "Foo's vtable pointer " << std::hex << *(uint64_t*)(&foo) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Bar's vtable pointer " << std::hex << *(uint64_t*)(&bar) << std::endl;
}

Is there a more direct way to express the idea that I want the location of the vtable for a particular type like Foo or Bar?
The method does not have to be portable. It only has to work for gcc on Linux.

I assume before trying this type of hack you've ran valgrind, asan, ubsan?

I'm debugging parts of a distributed system.  When I attached valgrind it changed the timing so much I could not reproduce the problem. I haven't yet seen it heard of the other two but will look at them.

I'll be interested to know if the problem really was vtable corruption.  Anyway, most often, though compiler dependent, the vtable is at the beginning of the object - of these objects you use as an example, for example.  (Where it isn't at the beginning: when the base class has no virtuals, for example.)  Anyway, do you have access to a heap that can detect, in debug mode, overruns by allocating guards ahead and behind of heap allocations?  (MS VC++ has this capability.)  It shouldn't perturb timing much at all (assuming you're not near the machine RAM capacity).

C++ does not define how polymorphism is to be implemented. vtables are just the defacto standard, but if any compiler vendor finds an appropriate different approach, he is free to do whatever he wants.
So whatever you try to do programmatically, it always will stay a dirty hack because the vtable is an internal compiler detail not directly visible to C++ code.
[ Edit: Needed to correct myself: gcc places a pointer to the vtable right at the beginning of a polymorphic class. Following from this: simply cast your object to uintptr_t (not uint64_t) (or a pointer to uintptr_t*) and you will get directly the pointer to the vtable. If you additionally want to print the vtable itself (to see if this one got corrupted), this might help: What is the VTable Layout and VTable Pointer Location in C++ Objects in GCC 3.x and 4.x? ]
Actually, I do not expect that you will find out much as you probably will see a change in the vtable long after it actually happened. If you know or can find out which object instance(s) is/are affected, you could add a memory watchpoint on write access (https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Set-Watchpoints.html) in gdb. This would reveal exactly when and where your vtable is corrupted (e. g. if you write beyond the defined borders of an array, cast your object to wrong type and write to it, ...).

Please see the note at the bottom of the question regarding portability.  I'm aware that vtable is an implementation detail.

And I know - the point is - because of being an implementation detail, you won't get a nice C++ way to access it...

@orenrevenge Why opinion? Implementation details are hid away from the user and fact is that a standard way to access them does not exist (a compiler might provide access to as an extension, but non of the currently available ones does so). The only way to access such details are hacks that are not covered by the standard. That's it, nothing to discuss about. Even worse: As being left to the implementation (i. e. compiler) any one might do the stuff slightly differently in the details, even though the general concept of vtables in practice is well established.

every C++ book I read stated that polymorphism is acheived via virtual table. Even Bjarne Stroustrop's book state that polymorphism is not very expensive as it is just one vtbale for all classes, and just one indirection. Bjarne Stroustrop clearly states this vtable address is the first member of the class. So I get confused and frustrated when all of a sudden, vtables are not defined in the standard. Is like I want to say; Well F@@k you too Bjarne Stroustrop. And also, I want to state that dynamic_cast is rubbish. It doesnt actually tell you if an object can dynamically cast.

@user13947194 They are the de-facto standard for the implementation. That's why Stroustrop refers to them as well. Still v-tables are not mentioned anywhere in the C++ standard. Try to find them yourself ;) And that's the reason, as written already, that there's no language internal tool to access them. That hasn't much to do with the dynamic_cast. If a compiler vendor finds an alternative approach that one would have to cover the DC as well. The DC is a language tool, so it must be provided, whichever way you go to implement...

@user13947194 The standard indeed does state that DC only can be applied to virtual classes, by the way. Still that doesn't mean the standard would mandate one or another way how it is implemented. Apart from there's a common sense that your programme shouldn't have need of anyway, if it does, that's usually a hint to a more or less severe design flaw...

@Aconcagua So when books imply that vtables are apart of the standard nothing is wrong with that? Secondly, java's instanceof operator is a complete waste of time because it promotes bad design?

@user13947194 There's nothing wrong about. Java or C# know about v-tables, too, and hide them away from user as well. I'd assume pretty much every language with polymorphism support does so. And why shouldn't they? What would you want to do with during normal programming anyway? Java's instanceof is of a similar quality than dynamic_cast – usually you should not need it. But as usual there might be exceptions. Would you want to refactor an entire large type hierarchy just because you discover one single type requiring special handling that is not covered by the common interface? Pragmatism…

Reliable, Safe and Pleasant. ESPECIALLY ADAPTED TO DENTAL PRACTICE. The absolute safety of Listerine, combined with its agreeable properties, gives it unques- tionable superiority for oral diseases and internal use over all other antiseptics, notably those whose deadly nature requires their administration only under the highest dilution, and where commercial differences, the slightest mishap or idiosyncrasies may bring disaster. The formula of L sterine, no less than the uniformly good practical results following its use, sustains the claim that it possesses something more than mere mechanical germicidal properties. fl^fTaken internally in teaspoonful doses, Listerine arrests the fermentative eructations of dyspepsia, so often associated with or resulting from oral disease. IflWUsed by Inhalation and Internally in advanced stages of respiratory diseases, it promptly suppresses the gangrenous odor and butyric fermenta- tion of the diseased bronchial surfaces, and thus checks blood poisoning. 'For cleansing and in operations the dilution has been varied from one to twenty parts water and one part Listerine, according to conditions and taste. 'Note its value as a menstrum, its miscibility with glycerine, etc. The value of Listerine has been thoroughly determined by very many of the Dental Profession, and a pamphlet embodying its Formula and Reports from the following and many other well-known dentists will be forwarded gratis upon request and the mention of this journal.

Gentlemen : After having practiced Dentistry for fourteen years I determined in 1866 to make a Specialty of Dentifrices, with a view of producing an article which should not only be acceptable to the general public, but also be approved and indorsed by the Dental Profession. In order to do this I made it a point to find out what were consid- ered by Dentists to be the most important requisites in a dentifrice. I soon learned that, while opinions varied as to the best materials to be used, nearly all were agreed upon a few essential points, namely, that a powder was more effectual than a liquid, that it must be a powder free from harsh or gritty substances and perfectly soluble ; that for universal use it should not be medicated, that healthy gums needed no tonic, and that in cases of diseased gums it should be left to the discretion of the6 Dentist to prescribe the needed remedy. With these facts to start with I then set myself to work selecting the best materials, combining them in the best manner and putting them up in the most convenient form. I need not say that this has been a work of years, and that I have been all the time studying and learning, until now, after an experience oi eighteen years, I can confidently present my Tooth Tablets and my Tooth. Powder as the result of my labors. They are made from the same materials, but put up in different form, each in Enameled Metal Boxes, which are free from the mishaps incident to glass or wood, and best adapted to the wants of the people, especially those who travel. They will be found in all the leading stores where such goods are sold, and where Dentists can recommend their patients to call for them. This obviates the necessity of Dentists keeping such preparations, which has proved by experience to be generally unprofitable. I should be pleased to forward a sample of my Tablets or Powder to any Dentist, free of expense, on receipt of a postal card giving address, that all may have an opportunity to test its merits.

But it would give me great pleasure to express in some way, the satisfaction 1 have experienced in the use of the Amalgam made with it. In the pro- portions in which [ use it, one-fourth Mercury to three-fourths Alloy, it produces the best plastic filling I have ever constructed. Becoming very hard and tough, it is susceptible of receiving a high polish, and does not shrink under severe tests. In color it is a very light grey, which does not change in the mouth. Possessing, as it certainly does, in an eminent degree, the above valuable qualities, I consider it the best alloy I have ever used. Very respectfully, J NO. B. RICH.

It is so far in adT'ance of the Emulsions and all for- mer preparations of the Oil that they hear no comparison with it. 1st. It contains 52 per cent, of pure Cod Liver Oil combined with Condensed Milk. 2d. Both the Oil and Milk are perfectly digested and wholly assimilable, and consequently will agree with the most delicate stomach, while the use of the plain Oil or the Emulsions soon injures digestion to such an extent that but a small portion is assimilated. 3d. It is so palatable that many Physicians administer it to delicate patients as a prepara- tion of cream. 4th. The administration of plain Cod Liver Oil, or the Emulsions now in use, will almost invariably exhaust the peptic secretions of the stomach in its effort to peptonize a substance only digested in the duodenum and also cause unpleasant eructations and nausea. 5th. A trial of Peptonized Cod Liver Oil and Milk will convince any Physician that its reconstructive properties will prove five times greater than plain Oil or the Emulsions now in use. 6th. The keeping qualities of Peptonized Cod Liver Oil and Milk have been thoroughly tested at all decomposable temperatures. 7th. The complete masking of the Oil in Peptonized Cod Liver Oil and Milk is almost wholly due to the digested milk. 8th. Peptonized Cod Liver Oil and Milk is furnished at the same price as plain Oil or the Emulsions, although it costs one-third more to produce. 9th. P/iysicians or Druggists need not hesitate to order Peptonized Con Liver Oil and Milk, for if it does not prove satisfactory in every respect, tve will immediately refund its ost. We also manufacture the above preparation combined with hypophosphites OF LIME AND SODA. We will furnish gratuitously to any Physician who will pay carriage a pint bottle of the above preparation.

Very recently several cases of Scarlatina have come under my care, ranging in severity from the very mild to the type S. Anginosa, in the treatment of which Bromo-Chloralum has played so important a part, and has been followed by so successful results that I am induced to believe that this agent, properly used, will materially lessen the death rate from this terrible disease, and also largely disarm this malady of its contagious character. I shall hereafter incorporate Bromo-Chloralum in the treatment of all Scarlatinal cases, while similar results attest its remedial value. The modus operandi is perhaps, in part, susceptible of explanation by the fact that " Bromo " is a disinfectant prompt in its action. In cases where the patient's breath is foul, and the air of the room consequently made noxious and perceptibly impure, the influence of " Bromo" admin- istered internally and as a wash for the throat and mouth, is soon felt in the removal, to a great extent, of the cause that operated to produce these effects. The same remedy should be exposed on cloths, suspended in the room and over the doorway, so that the air that passes into and out of the sick-room, to and from the adjoining rooms occupied by the family, must pass through, as it were, a " Bromo Strainer." In consequence of its power to arrest fermentation, and its purifying effect on the atmosphere in the sick-room, we are led to believe the disease aborts, and the air passing to adjoining rooms carries no longer a potent virus. As a frequent wash for the mouth and throat, in such cases as call for topic measures, I prescribe: — I£. Bromo Chloralum, 3 i ; Water or Simple Syrup, 3 vii. M. As an internal remedy I give it in doses of gtt. ii to gtt. v, on sugar or in water every two hours. The cases to which I have alluded all terminated favorably. In no instance to my knowledge was the contagion carried beyond the pale of the afflicted household, and where i,t attacked other members of the family, the disease assumed a very much milder and more tractable form. Dr. Brockett, in the new edition of his work on contagious diseases, remarks: — " This preparation is entirely free from caustic properties, has no odor of its own, and effectually removes all offensive odors where it is sprinkled, or cloths wet with it are hung up ; its vapor has no irritating property even to the weakest lung; it is a thorough and perfect dis- infectant, destroying not by corrosion, but by its antiseptic quality, all fungi and germs of dis- ease ; it is applicable in a dilute state to ulcers, sores, gangrened wounds, and catarrhal or other inflammations of the mucous membranes and the air passages, is an admirable gargle, and if taken internally, has an alterative and stimulating effect.

IIERBST'S NEW METHOD OF FILLING TEETH. BY DB. W. I). MILLER, BERLIN", GERMANY. The method of inserting gold fillings strenuously advocated by W. Herbst, of Bremen, during the last half decade, is sufficiently well known to the profession to render a detailed description unnecessary. This method is especially characterized by two features. The first of these is the extensive use of the matrix for approximal cavities, the second the employment of a rotating, smooth-pointed instrument for condensing the gold. The operation may be best made clear by describing a case in practice. We have to fill the left upper bicuspids, both decayed on the approximal surfaces. The cavities are opened to the grind- ing surface and prepared as for inserting a cohesive foil filling, with exception of retaining points, which are never made. The matrix is now brought into place, and the point of a steel pin inserted between the matrix and first bicuspid from the buccal side, and if necessary from the lingual side also, so as to press the matrix tight against the surface of the second bicuspid at the neck ; warmed shellac is now packed into the cavity of the first bicuspid, to hold the matrix firmly in position. After the cavity of the second bicuspid has been filled, the shellac and matrix are removed, a second higher (wider) matrix inserted and pressed by the same 1 542 Original Communications. means as before, tight against the surface of the first bicuspid, which is then ready for filling. Should the second bicuspid be wanting, then the matrix is held in position by filling the whole space i etween the first bicuspid and the first molar with shellac. The matrix being in position, three or four cylinders of Wolrab foil No. 8, 3 or 4 (or an equivalent of Wolrab foil No. 4 made into pellets) are brought into the cavity just as they would be into a simple cavity on the grinding surface, and fixed into position by pressing tightly upon them with one of the larger burnishers of the set, slowly rotating. It is then condensed by a succession of strong taps or pressures of the rapidly rotating instrument No. 5. (The surface of the instrument soon becomes coated with gold, which must be removed by pressing it while rotating upon a piece of pure tin.) This is then followed up by an ordinary hand plugger, to ascer- tain whether the gold has been properly condensed at all points. The above process is repeated till the operation is completed, the surface of the gold at last being thoroughly condensed by means of one of the smooth polished instruments of the set. In filling large cavities on the grinding surface, first two, three, or four cylinders of No. 1, 2 or 3 Wolrab foil are pressed against the bottom of the cavity with the pliers, and then with one of the polished instruments, slowly rotating, fixed in position; if it does not at once become firm, more gold is put in till it does; it is then con- densed with No. 5, rapidly rotating, and this instrument is then used almost exclusively till the gold is all in ; then No. 1-4 or 7 is used for condensing the surface. Approximal cavities in the central incisors are treated as follows (previous separation by means of cotton having been secured) : The cavities are prepared slightly broader at the bottom than at the opening; no retaining points are required. Two or three cylin- ders of No. 2 Wolrab foil are pressed into the first tooth towards the gums, likewise into the second tooth, and condensed with No. 5; this process being repeated till both cavities are overfilled, so that the gold in the two fillings appears to form one continuous mass. Then No. 15 (a clean, fine needle), slowly rotating, is pressed through between the filling at different points, and the separation Herbs? s New Method of Filling Teeth. — Miller. 543 completed with a fine file. The fillings are then further condensed by Nos. 12-14, rapidly rotating, with interrupted pressure. The advantages claimed for the Herbst method are: 1st. Rapidity of operation. This comes particularly into account in proximal fillings, which can be inserted in much less time than is required bv either the hand or electric mallet. 2d. The injuries frequently done to frail tooth structure, as well as to the pericementum by the use of heavy mallets, of course are entirely avoided. 3d. The equally baneful necessity of weakening or sapping a tooth by large retaining points is also done away with. •1th. The operation is less disagreeable to the patient than that by the mallet method. Perhaps the most valuable feature .of any method is the ability to produce by it fillings which shall be perfectly adapted to the walls of the cavity, and in this respect the Herbst method seems to promise success. A number of fillings made by Herbst, with the time occupied in the insertion of each, were sent to me with the request that I would give them a thorough examination. For this purpose I caused similar fillings to be inserted in the same time by the hand mallet and by Telchow's Pneumatic Mallet. The teeth were then immersed in an alcoholic solution of fuchsine and allowed to remain twenty-four hours ; at the end of this time they were split, and it was found that Herbst' s fillings had resisted the penetrating power of the liquid better than the others; i. e., they made better contact with the walls of the cavity than those inserted by the other methods. Herbst makes use of gold cylinders pre- pared by Wolrab in Bremen, a preparation which works, in the words of an old operator, "like mush." How far his success is to be ascribed to the admirable qualities of the gold I do not know, nor is it possible to say how his fillings will stand the test of time. This much, however, we may safely say, that his method has shown itself to be deserving of a thorough investigation, and it is particularly desirable that American operators should make them- selves acquainted with it. Cuts of the instruments employed by Herbst may be found in the number for February, 1884.— Editor. M4 Original Communications. A VISIT TO THE DENTIST. 15 Y ONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE. "Twaa midnight's holy hour," and the great city, with all its burden of humanity, slept in peace. The pale moon rode the heav- ens in serene majesty. The stars looked down from their blazing thrones, and mocked the darkness. Great Orion was hunting with his dogs, and the seven Old Maid Sisters simpered at the irn im- pressible Hercules. Suddenly a cry tingled upward to the very vault of the sky, and re-echoed through all the arches of the empy- rean— a cry which was like the agony of some strong soul in mar- tyrdom— which voiced volumes of unutterable anguish — which spoke of rending heart-chords and snapping tendrils of the soul — a cry at which the shadows shuddered, the earth trembled, great Jove stared, and the rat-terrier howled piteously to silver-horned Diana. Was it the crack of doom ? Was it the day of dissolution ? Was it the death- cry of one of the Immortals, which pierced through the shivering air, and shrieked through the silent streets, and awoke with its accents of woe the slumbering thousands from balmy slum- ber to acute sympathy for some appalling catastrophe? No! no in- significant matter like this, no such bare and pitiful circumstance sent such a pang through and through Mother Earth's bosom, and struck the babies like a cataclysm of green apples and cucumbers. It was something more portentous and tremendous in the awful and terrific consequences to the universe, and to humanity, and to Jones! For Jones had the toothache ! Of all the somniferous mil- lions peopling this degenerate planet, Mrs. Jones first became aware of the pitiful calamity as Jones bounded from the bed and came down on some freezing oilcloth, clasping with both hands the cheek which enclosed the jumping, demoniac snag. And then all the other Joneses awoke. The baby was barely saved from an attack of catalepsy, and Bobby, who had been reading Buffalo Bill's thrill- ing romances, yelled in his sleep as he dreamed of the war-whoop of the Sioux, and felt their scalping-knives, and the whole household could not have been thrown into greater consternation, from centre to circumference, if some nihilist had blown them up with dyna- mite. And as for Jones, alas for all the weight of woe which the primal curse has brought upon the ruined race! Do not the prob- A Visit to the Dentist. 545 lems of suffering, and the mystery of sorrow, and the crushing questions of sin and anguish which have baffled and oppressed the wisest for ages, become at times almost intolerable? There are crises in the history of every individual, when he is brought face to face with the great sphinx-like enigmas of life and its terrors, when life seems not worth the living, when earth is but a vale of tears, and any existence worse than none! Such a moment of destiny, upon which all his after years might turn, had come to Jones. He became suddenly and poignantly aware that living was not a jest; that our being must be something more than a terpsichorean feast; and as he danced around in the darkness, with the thermometer at zero, and barked his unprotected shins upon the furniture, Jones realized in all its profound solemnity that life was real, life was earnest! Jones was a pillar in the Hard-shell Baptist Church, and believed in foreordination, and predestination, and the perseverance and preservation of the saints, and his language on this memorable night was framed on the most orthodox models of the emphatic language of the strictest theology. Jones, though horrified, was self-possessed enough to give her em- phatically worse-half a piece of her mind. Jones was very glad it was only a piece, and not the whole, and trembled before the imagination of the remainder. But Jones himself was in no mood for jocularity. He felt the desperation of his circumstances, and yet he was conscious that, just as he was, he was hardly the figure for a heroic bust in marble. But Mrs. Jones was equal to the emergency. She always was. Jones had too often felt her guiding and shaping hand directing the current of his history, ever to doubt the competency of his wife. With some ejaculations pecul- iarly feminine she set to work in the cold to prepare a poultice, while her maniac husband shrieked at her slowness and cursed the man who first invented teeth. But Mrs. Jones was fearfully agitated by the gravity of the occasion, and by the precipitate cries of her 546 Original Communications. husband, who felt that the emergency called for action, noble, sub- lime, godlike action, and in her haste the poultice was prepared so scalding hot that it blistered the cuticle of her good man by the time it had touched it. Ye who have seen the noble rage of the Spanish bull, pricked to exasperation by arrows and javelins; ye who have heard the mighty roaring of the caged Nemean lion as the old fat women have poked him with umbrellas in the circus, can but feebly imagine that howl of indignation, a sense of insult added to injury, as Jones executed a leg-movement which would have made a South Sea cannibal grow greenery-yallery with envy. There was a time in the halcyon days of lang-syne, in the coy and callow period of ecstatic youth, when Jones loved his wife, his heart's first choice. There was a time when he called her beautiful ; a time when the appendix to the Great Unabridged, with its addi- tional collection of endearing epithets, would have filled a long-felt want, as the giraffe said when he took a drink down through his mile of gullet. But so fades love's dream away; on this night his language could, on hardly any construction, be considered compli- mentary. It was more than merely negative; it was quite positive in its dialect of unappreciation. And Mrs. Jones thought that an extra bright diadem ought to be decreed to her for restraining her righteous anger under such a load of provocation. So she mildly apologized, and made a modest suggestion of toothache drops. A generous supply of the liquid was put into his mouth, but as it trickled and meandered down his esophagus it was a sight for gods and men. Jones acted like one of the ancient oracles who presided at the temple of Delphos, and his wife fled before his insanity only to be recalled in thundering tones with a demand for liniment. Perry Davis was speedily and tremblingly introduced, and without thought a dilution of that noted gentleman was applied to the already blistered surface of the face. Jones gasped at this next horror, for he was already exhausted. The climax was capped. He sat down upon the bed with smothered groans, like a man who had met his fate and mastered it. He would have come down to us, had he lived in those ancient times, as one of the grandest of the stoics. It is a consolation, in the direst extremity of our woe, to know at last that the worst possible has happened. We derive a comfort from the very absoluteness of our misery. Thus was it with Jones. He felt that he had touched bottom. He defied the gods to do A Visit to the Dentist. 547 their worst. He could smile at all their thunderbolts, like Prome- theus chained to the rock and refusing to yield, though the vulture gnawed at his vitals. At last Mrs. Jones ventured to say, timidly and laconically: "Why not have it out?" But this cutting of the Gordian knot did not especially commend itself to the sufferer. There are feelings in this world! Sentiment is not a thing to be made light of. The man who implored the woodman to spare that tree might not have been much of a poet; he may have been a namby-pamby individual, used to the melting mood, and dropping tears as fast as the Arabian tree its medicinal gum, but after all his heart was under the proper side of his vest. We dislike to part with old friends. It was a severe trial for that Congressman whose term had expired, when in a Washington boarding-house he was com- pelled to approach a venerable mackerel that had appeared so regu- larly upon the table, and take it gently by the tail for a farewell shake, as he tearfully exclaimed: "Good-bye, old mackerel! good- bye! The best of friends must part! This is a world of sorrow, where longest friendships must be ruthlessly severed! Good-bye, dear, old mackerel, good-bye!" And who, that has a spark of veneration in his bosom, can contemplate unmoved and unaffected the departure of some ancient molar that has seen our growth from youth to middle-life, an essential part of our existence ; that has shared in the checkered scenes of our probation here below ; that has by strict attention to the business of mastication filled its humble place duly and well, feeding stomach and brain, and keep- ing life and courage in the body ; who can regard the taking away of such an integral and intimate part of us without a sigh of regret, tearful and deep? It is like losing a part of our identity. Some- thing of self-consciousness seems to depart with it. We have a love for it which is a part of our ever-present self-love. And so Jones entertained some decided objections.

Graz, Austria, 2–4 November 2020. Graz, Austria, 2–4 November 2020. Graz, Austria, 2–4 November 2020. Published: 10 December 2020 Abstract: Low-cost infrared (IR) thermal cameras are powering a rising market of industrial and 
consumer applications. Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-based thermopile 
arrays are proven thermal imagers that can be monolithically integrated into low-cost and  
low-power-consumption formats for high-volume manufacturability. Here we present a simple method 
to evaluate the cross-talk of these arrays and propose a numerical model for device optimization. Keywords: cross-talk; infrared; MEMS; CMOS 1. Introduction Room temperature IR thermal imaging is increasingly important for a variety of applications, 
including smart homes, healthcare, security, and automotive [1]. In addition, with the emerging trend 
of miniaturization of optical systems on-chip, numerous possibilities exist within the broader 
application market, including thermal cameras integrated into smartphones, watches, or wearables [2]. When deployed for such applications, or within the internet of things (IoT) environment, IR cameras 
need to be low in cost (so they can be deployed in large numbers), and have low-power consumption 
(so they can be battery or energy-harvesting operated) [3]. Among various current technologies [1,2], 
CMOS-based thermopile IR cameras stand out in terms of manufacturing flexibility and offer cost 
and power consumption compatible with the consumer electronics and IoT requirements [3]. Here we present a novel approach for cross-talk measurement of a thermopile detector array. The measurement approach does not require a light source, or an on-chip heater [1], thus significantly 
simplifying the analysis. A numerical model, in agreement with the experimental observations, is 
also proposed, and used to demonstrate design optimization. Proceedings Proceedings www.mdpi.com/journal/proceedings Proceedings 2020, 56, 10; doi:10.3390/proceedings2020056010 2. Fabrication and Results Our device was fabricated using a commercial CMOS process, followed by back deep reactive 
ion etching (DRIE) to form the membrane. Highly doped single-crystal Si layers formed the p+ and 
n+ thermopile elements, while tungsten (W) interconnect layers formed heatsinking tracks  
between the pixels, as well as interconnects between the Si p+ and n+ elements. The membrane was 
1200 × 1200 µm and ~5 µm thick (Figure 1a). A device having an array size of 8 × 8 elements  
was fabricated as a proof-of-concept. The individual thermopile array elements consisted of  
52 thermocouples arranged on a single pixel (Figure 1a inset). www.mdpi.com/journal/proceedings Proceedings 2020, 56, 10; doi:10.3390/proceedings2020056010 Proceedings 2020, 56, 10 2 of 3 To measure the cross-talk, we used a bidirectional electrical biasing approach to obtain the 
thermoelectric voltage generated by a thermopile (pixel) under thermal stress. A range of biasing 
currents (~10 to 200 µA in our case) was applied to a pixel in both negative and positive directions, 
which as a result experienced ohmic heating. The thermoelectric voltage was then calculated by 
simply averaging the bidirectional generated voltages. The cross-talk was finally evaluated by 
comparing the voltage generated by an adjacent pixel to that of the heated pixel (Figure 1b). Compared to traditional methods based on light sources and complex focusing optics, our method is 
significantly easier to apply. In addition, it uses only the heat generated internally by the pixel, 
and thus does not suffer from light leakage to adjacent pixels, which can be challenging to control 
and quantify. To further investigate our approach, we used a numerical model based on COMSOL 
Multiphysics, which closely matched the experimental results (Figure 1c). By using the model, we 
showed that the cross-talk varies with the track-pads and can thus be optimized (Figure 1d). (b) (a)

this, in setting up our Natural Language Processing
course, our goal was to do so based on constructive
alignment and LTU’s pedagogical principles. We
hypothesized that adherence to both set of princi-
ples would be possible in an online version too. In this paper, by examining the design and imple-
mentation of the course and analyzing the student
feedback, we will demonstrate the viability of our
hypothesis. The
ongoing

has
brought online education to the forefront
of pedagogical discussions. To make this

sustainable
in
a
post-
pandemic era, online courses must be built on
strong pedagogical foundations. With a long
history of pedagogic research, there are many
principles, frameworks, and models available
to help teachers in doing so. These models
cover different teaching perspectives, such
as constructive alignment, feedback, and the
learning environment. In this paper, we dis-
cuss how we designed and implemented our
online Natural Language Processing (NLP)
course following constructive alignment and
adhering to the pedagogical principles of
LTU. By examining our course and analyzing
student evaluation forms, we show that we
have met our goal and successfully delivered
the course. Furthermore, we discuss the addi-
tional beneﬁts resulting from the current mode
of delivery, including the increased reusability
of course content and increased potential for
collaboration between universities. Lastly, we
also discuss where we can and will further
improve the current course design. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we discuss the related literature in Section 1.1,
followed by LTU’s pedagogical principles in Sec-
tion 1.2. Then in Section 2, we present the course
design. That is followed by the Teaching and learn-
ing activities being discussed in Section 3. Next,
we present the course evaluation result and the per-
spective of a volunteering student of the course
in Section 4. Lastly, we conclude the paper and
outline planned improvements in Section 5. 1.1
Related work The teaching paradigm has been moving from a
teacher-centered view to a more student-centered
perspective (Kaymakamoglu, 2018). Meaning that
instead of focusing on the role of the teacher, the
focus is more and more on what the student should
do, that is, process the material through deliberate
practice, collaboration, and active reﬂection. To ef-
fectively support this process, teaching is planned
and conducted with the student’s disposition in
mind, considering their prior knowledge, expecta-
tions, study skills, and other conditions. With the
proper planning, design, and implementation of the
course, active learning can then be achieved. Keywords-

Introduction With the COVID-19 pandemic, academic institu-
tions were pushed to moving their education on-
line (Gallagher and Palmer, 2020; Dick et al., 2020). Furthermore, even institutes that still allowed stu-
dents on campus were more open to online alter-
natives. However, in order to solidify the results
attained in online education (Ossiannilsson, 2021)
in these extraordinary circumstances, it is crucial
to demonstrate that this mode of education can
be a viable alternative to presential education in
terms of the underlying pedagogical fundamentals This active learning or student activation (Cook
and Babon, 2017) is achieved when students are
going into lectures and tutorials prepared to engage
in the learning process, and they are not just pas-
sively trying to absorb information. Active learning
encourages active cognitive processing of informa- 1 1. Emphasize relevant knowledge and skill, is
an important goal at university education to
emphasize relevant skills and knowledge; that
is to say, students should acquire the relevant
theoretical knowledge, as well as the skills
necessary to apply that knowledge. tion, and the concept is not a new one. Confucius is
often quoted as saying: "Tell me and I will forget,
show me and I may remember, involve me and I
will learn”. The use of student activation or ac-
tive learning is well suited for presential learning. In an online setting, this type of learning has to
be adapted to acquire the same knowledge from
online activities. The main goal for students is to
learn as well from online as in presential lectures. 2. Encourage active cognitive processing, so
as students engage with the subject matter
deliberately, contributing to long-term learn-
ing (Chi and Wylie, 2014). Following levels from (Center for Teaching and
Learning, 1990) might help to trigger student acti-
vation. 3. Choose forms of assessment that enhance
learning. The design of assessment has
a great impact on student learning (Sny-
der, 1971; Wiiand, 1998; Ramsden, 2003),
and thus it is important to choose the meth-
ods (“If you want to change student learn-
ing then change the methods of assess-
ment” (Brown G., 1999)), frequency, and con-
tent of assessment in a way that would con-
tribute to student learning. Naturally, active
learning, and student activation discussed in
more detail in Section refssec:related are cru-
cial components of adherence to this principle. 1
Introduction • To test the students’ memory by asking ques-
tions related to speciﬁc facts, terms, principles,
or theories. • To utilize the students’ knowledge to solve
problems or analyze a situation. • To exercise the informed judgment of the stu-
dents. Many pedagogical theories and frameworks have
been developed to facilitate effective teaching cov-
ering different aspects of teaching (Kandlbinder,
2014; Chi and Wylie, 2014; Cook and Babon, 2017;
Rust, 2002). However, with the advancement of
technology and globalization, the traditional ped-
agogical models were evolved to make distance
learning possible. Students can sit anywhere and
learn online through the internet and connect with
other students in the physical classroom or online. 4. Ensure clarity in the course and task de-
sign, an important principle to make sure stu-
dents have a clear picture of the course and its
requirements. One approach to achieve this is
that of constructive alignment (Kandlbinder,
2014), making clear connections between the
goals of the program, the intended learning
outcomes of the course, the assessment meth-
ods, and the activities carried out through the
course. Our designed course follows pedagogical prin-
ciples to enhance learning outcomes. The course
is segmented into 83 videos, given by eight lectur-
ers of different expertise, coherent and harmonized. This well-balanced theory-practical course covers
a broad range of applications and approaches. 5. Promote knowledge-enhancing feedback. It is important that students receive feed-
back on their work beside the ﬁnal assess-
ment, which could guide their progress and
inform them how close they are to learning
outcomes (Elmgren and Henriksson, 2018). The impact of feedback is highest when it is
in-time, personalized, and speciﬁc. 5. Promote knowledge-enhancing feedback. It is important that students receive feed-

LTU’s Pedagogical Principles To support the development of teaching practices
and students developing the necessary skills re-
quired for them to become independent actors in
their respective ﬁelds, LTU developed its pedagog-
ical idea centering around nine important princi-
ples (Luleå University of Technology, University
Pedagogy Center). These principles support Öre-
bro University pedagogical principles (Örebro Uni-
versity), and we believe other courses, in other uni-
versities, should follow the same principles. Here,
we brieﬂy introduce these principles (along with
feedback regarding the course) as a barometer for
our course design. 6. Foster independence and self-awareness is
an important principle when we consider the
current need for life-long learning and the goal
of university education as enabling students to
become independent actors in their respective
ﬁelds. 2 rooted not only in pedagogical practices but also in
pedagogical theories and research. 7. Be aware of your students’ starting points,
as learning is more effective when the new
information is either integrated into existing
mental frameworks or said frameworks are
reshaped by the new information. For this,
however, it is crucial that we are aware of the
current mental framework of students. Fur-
thermore, being aware of the starting point
of learners is also crucial to identify skill or
knowledge gaps that should be ﬁlled. 2.1
Objectives/Intended Learning Outcomes In accordance with constructive alignment (Kandl-
binder, 2014), course level objectives and Intended
Learning Outcomes (ILOs) were set at the begin-
ning of process of course design. For this, we were
following the pedagogical principles, as well as
ABCD and SMART techniques (Tullu et al., 2015;
Smaldino et al., 2005; Doran et al., 1981). Based
on these factors, the ILOs for the NLP course were
as follows: After passing the course, the student
should be able to... 8. Communicate high, positive expectations,
so as to stimulate students for higher perfor-
mance; a phenomenon widely known as the
Pygmalion effect (Goddard, 1995). • ...explain and use text preprocessing tech-
niques 9. Create a supportive learning environment,
is a principle supporting all preceding princi-
ples. Since the proper environment is key to
communicate not only high but positive ex-
pectations in a manner that encourages and
not discourages students. Similarly, in a sup-
portive environment, students are more open
to discussing their experiences and receiving
feedback. 9. Create a supportive learning environment,

with its components, optional and mandatory
ones • ...explain how text could be analyzed • ...evaluate results of text analytics • ...analyze and reﬂect on the various tech-
niques used in text analytics and the parame-
ters needed as well as the problem solved As we consider adherence to them especially dif-
ﬁcult in an online setting, we will give particular
consideration to principles 2, 5, and 9. For exam-
ple, in the absence of in-presence teaching, when
in-person interaction between students and teacher
and among students is not possible, it is especially
challenging to create a supportive learning environ-
ment, and the opportunities to give feedback also
diminish. Online learning management systems
like Canvas and Blackboard provide the infrastruc-
tures to conduct courses online. However, similar
to classrooms, it is up to teachers and course de-
velopers to ﬁll them with content and utilize them
effectively. We would discuss the learning manage-
ment systems and how we used them to support the
pedagogical principles in Section 3.3. 2.2
Course description The course contents were designed according to the
ILOs discussed in Section 2.1. The syllabus and
content of the course were designed after examin-
ing NLP courses, and other similar courses offered
by different universities, as well as reviewing rele-
vant literature (Agarwal, 2013; Hearst, 2005; Liddy
and McCracken, 2005). Our NLP course consists
of seven modules that provide motivation, tools,
and techniques for solving NLP problems. This
section explains the contents of the modules brieﬂy
to give the reader a better understanding of how the
ILOs are reﬂected in the proposed contents. 2
Course Design In this section, we examine the course design based
on LTU’s pedagogical principles (see Section 1.2),
the principle of constructive alignment, and other
pedagogical considerations. We should note here
that one may arrive at similar design patterns based
solely on practical considerations as well. However,
we consider it an integral part of our contribution
that the design of the NLP course discussed here is The course starts at the ﬁrst module with NLP
applications, providing links to online API, chat-
bots, and dialog systems to motivate students. Then
we discuss basic deﬁnitions and concepts in NLP,
such as what a language is. The second module of
this course is devoted to structure analysis of texts. Morphological analysis like n-grams and ﬁltering
(such as identifying missing values, tokenization, 3 stemming & lemmatization, handling URLs, ac-
cents, contractions, typos, digits, etc.) is covered
in the second module. Moreover, Part Of Speech
(POS) is described, including its application and a
more in-depth view into it. This module also de-
scribes the syntax and syntactic analysis of a text,
followed by feature extraction and text representa-
tion; it starts with commonly used features in NLP
and describes different encodings that can represent
text to machines. 2.3
Video Clips stemming & lemmatization, handling URLs, ac-
cents, contractions, typos, digits, etc.) is covered
in the second module. Moreover, Part Of Speech
(POS) is described, including its application and a
more in-depth view into it. This module also de-
scribes the syntax and syntactic analysis of a text,
followed by feature extraction and text representa-
tion; it starts with commonly used features in NLP
and describes different encodings that can represent
text to machines. Our main challenge here is to deliver the material
in a manner that still adheres to Principle 2 and
encourages active cognitive processing. To achieve
this goal, the design of the lecture format is one of
the ﬁrst consequences. For that, we split our mate-
rial into short videos with a length of at most ten
minutes. (McKeachie et al., 2006; Benjamin, 2002;
Ozan and Ozarslan, 2016; Bordes et al., 2021). De-
livering the course in short videos has the beneﬁt of
encouraging active cognitive processing of students
among videos, as discussed in Section 1. The third module of this course delivers the the-
ory and practice of neural networks. It starts with
the basics of neurons and network architectures,
then training using backpropagation followed by
vanishing gradients and over/under ﬁtting problems. RNN, LSTM, GRU, and CNN layers are covered
in depth. This module ﬁnishes by debugging neu-
ral networks, discussing regularizers, and covering
common problems of neural networks. Another beneﬁt of presenting our course content
in short videos is the potential for the reusability of
videos (Crame, 2016). Lastly, splitting all subjects
into smaller topics facilitates sharing the workload
among many presenters. It allowed us to organize
the course in a joint setting, as discussed in more
detail in Section 2.4. 2.4
Joint Course Having the essential tools of NLP, the fourth
module is more towards application, text classiﬁca-
tion, and how NLP problems can be solved using
neural networks. This module starts in learning
taxonomies, with a step-by-step design of an end-
to-end neural network. It also discusses common
choices for simple network architectures, learning
taxonomies, multi-class, multi-label, and multi-
task problems. After that, text classiﬁcation is
grounded to the problem of tagging in NLP, fol-
lowed by transfer learning methods. At the end of
this module, standard metrics in NLP are discussed. Designing and developing a course for multiple
initiatives requires a deep knowledge of the ﬁeld, a
broad range of knowledge in the ﬁeld, and a deeper
understanding of each topic. This requirement is
not easy to be fulﬁlled by one lecturer. Thus, we
make it a joint course between Örebro University
(ORU) and LTU. This allows beneﬁting from mul-
tiple lecturers that let each deliver a specialized
lecture. Load sharing is the other beneﬁt of a joint
course. However, designing and developing a joint
course with multiple lecturers brought some difﬁ-
culties, such as: The ﬁfth module is dedicated to semantics, in-
troducing semantics and symbols in NLP and pos-
sible ways to represent them. The theory of frames
and synsets are discussed as the formal represen-
tation of semantics. Then, vector representations
of semantics are discussed alongside different ap-
proaches to obtain them. Approaches like distribu-
tional hypothesis, statistical methods, and neural
methods such as Word2vec are covered. At the end

embeddings are reviewed. • Keeping harmony between lectures. • Segmenting sub-topics to keep the lengths
short. • Distributing each subtopic between lecturers. • Avoiding repetition in lectures. 2.5
Assessment and Assignments like a discussion, and we assess each student based
on that. An open discussion trying to mimic the
understanding of a real problem related to NLP
is conducted. The discussion starts with an ask-
ing about the general understanding of one of the
known NLP applications, such as machine trans-
lation. All the consecutive questions are asked to
evaluate the practical understanding of the problem
and test the need in each stage to implement the so-
lution. The examiner and examinee use the zoom’s
whiteboard to convey the questions and answers
for better clarity. To achieve desired students’ activation, we de-
signed the initial assignments and project tasks
involving ready-to-use web API for various appli-
cations like hate speech, profanity ﬁltering, image
captioning. Later, the focus is on how these applica-
tions are developed using NLP. Therefore, we cover
theoretical, numerical, and programming tasks in
assignments and projects. The course’s assessment design is based on a
quote by David Boud “students can escape bad
teaching, but they cannot escape bad assessment”. The forms of assessment in the joint NLP course
were based on guiding the students towards achiev-
ing their learning outcomes. We avoid designing
the assessment as a written exam at the end of the
course as we are looking to engage the students
with the course contents all the way till the end
of the course (Principle 2, 3) (Luleå University of
Technology, University Pedagogy Center). The as-
sessment had been done in two stages which are
practical project and oral discussion. The practi-
cal project is designed to follow the principle of
the constructive alignment (Kandlbinder, 2014). The project’s main objective is to lead the student
to develop an actual NLP application (Principle
8) (Luleå University of Technology, University
Pedagogy Center) but in the form of accumula-
tive ﬁve tasks. The task will guide the students
through the different levels of Bloom’s cognitive
domain (Bloom et al., 1956), namely Remembering,
Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating
and Creating. 3
Teaching and Learning Activities The course is designed to maximize the intended
learning outcomes. We refer to students some
python programming tutorials available online to
get familiarized with Python. This section de-
scribes this course’s teaching and learning activ-
ities, which includes delivering lectures in short
videos, live sessions, lab sessions, and our learning
management system. • Avoiding repetition in lectures. To overcome these difﬁculties, lecturers from the
two universities hold weekly meetings to design the
course and distribute sub-topics among themselves. Lecturers created material by themselves, and then
the material and the narratives are reviewed weekly. Moreover, after the course’s ﬁrst run, all materials
are reviewed again to keep the outcome coherent
and harmonic. This revision and harmonization of
material should contribute to the clarity of course
content (Principle 4). Sequence to sequence architectures, encoder-
decoder architecture, attention, transformers, and
Bert model are discussed in the next module. At
the end, some different topics such as structured
prediction, arc-standard transition parsing, and in-
sights into dialog and chatbots, image captioning,
and gender bias in NLP were discussed. 4 3.1
Live Sessions The lectures are delivered through recorded videos
on each module of the course. However, it is essen-
tial to take the students’ questions, reﬂections and
address their potential confusion after they have
watched the video lectures. For this, we conducted
weekly live sessions for each module. Students
learned from the video lectures and discussed with
the instructors in the live sessions, thus, aligned
with ﬂipped classroom learning. These live ses-
sions where students had the opportunity to directly
ask the instructors contributed toa supportive learn-
ing environment (Principle 9), and gave us the op-
portunity to provide the students with feedback
(Principle 5). Each task is designed to match with the weekly
delivered contents, so it will give real feedback on
how the students understand and implement the
concepts in practice (Principle 5) (Luleå Univer-
sity of Technology, University Pedagogy Center),
and whether they can transfer the knowledge (the-
ory) from one context to another context (Practi-
cal Implementation). Students have the ﬂexibil-
ity to choose the programming language (however,
Python is preferred), framework, or tool that they
would like to use to reach the target. The pro-
vided ﬂexibility will give a chance to ﬁnd multiple
approaches proposed by different students to sort
out the problem (Principle 6, (Luleå University of
Technology, University Pedagogy Center)). The
sharing of different ideas among the class will add
signiﬁcant value to the course outcome. The ﬁnal
exam is an oral exam for each student. It is more The live sessions were delivered to address the
queries regarding the theoretical concepts, practi-
cals, contents, speciﬁc assignments, and other or-
ganizational queries. We addressed the immediate
queries, and the queries asked in discussion threads
in Canvas for the modules covered until a speciﬁc
live session. However, there was a scope of queries
related to the upcoming part of the course. Live sessions are conducted online through
zoom every week during the course. There are
at least two instructors and one teaching assistant
present during online live sessions. First, we took
the queries asked in the learning management sys- 5 the Pytorch framework and, ﬁnally, an advanced
machine translation (MT) task. tem. We have a follow-up discussion regarding
those queries. Next, we have other questions re-
lated to the theory and practicals. 3.3
Learning Management Systems We encourage students to ask more and more
questions/confusions to enhance their learning
(Gibbs, 2005). In the end, we ask for regular feed-
back (Principle 5) (Luleå University of Technology,
University Pedagogy Center) for each module, ei-
ther in the live sessions or in learning management
system. The lack of in-person interaction between students
and teachers did emphasize the framework through
which the students were interacting with the course
material and the teachers. The two universities of-
fering the NLP course used different frameworks
or Learning Management Systems (LMSs) for this
task; however, the principles to bear in mind were
the same. Most importantly, the course material
had to be presented in the LMS in a way to make
it clear for the student what their task is and how
to proceed with their learning (Principle 4: ensure
clarity in the course and task design). Another crit-
ical aspect of the LMS was to facilitate interaction
between teachers and students, providing an open
channel of communication (Principle 9: Create a
supportive learning environment). Additionally,
it was required that the LMS facilitates feedback
(Principle 5: Promote knowledge-enhancing feed-
back) and supports the assessment methods to be
used for the course (Principle 3: Choose forms of
assessment that enhance learning). In the following
sections, we will discuss how each LMS was used
to achieve these goals. 3.2
Lab Sessions Practical (lab) sessions make up student-centered
teaching strategies for experiential courses (Moate
and Cox, 2015). The lab sessions provide practi-
cal programming experience to the students, fol-
lowing Kolb’s cycle and ICAP framework (Kolb,
2014; Chi and Wylie, 2014). Students watch or
read a given experience (as concrete experience)
and reﬂect on it (as reﬂective observation) before
conceptualizing how to go about implementation
through ﬂowchart or pseudocode and ﬁnally active
experimentation by writing and running the codes. Furthermore, in a lab session, students get to ask
questions and get possible answers from their col-
leagues or the instructor. They also get formative
feedback after the lab session (Principle 5) through
online channels identiﬁed in this work, making it
possible for them to improve their practical skills. They can work together in groups (using online
collaborative tools), which is sometimes preferred. This makes it an interactive session, thereby achiev-
ing the interacting stage of the ICAP framework
(Chi and Wylie, 2014). Assessment at the end of
each lab session provides a good context and affects
learning (Rust, 2002). 3.3.1
Canvas and Blackboard Both Canvas and Blackboard are cloud-based LMS
used for courses at many educational institutes. Here, we will discuss (in numerical order) how
we set up the course in them to support the above-
listed pedagogical principles. • Principle 3: Both Canvas and Blackboard en-
ables the posting and evaluation of the assign-
ment types we used (for more details, see Sec-
tion 2.5). Moreover, they also enable students
to assign peer feedback tasks for students au-
tomatically. This feature contributes to the
adherence to Principle 6 (Foster independence
and self-awareness) by encouraging students
to reﬂect on others’ learning and the require-
ments of each assignment. The technique is a vital element of pedagogy,
which is the science of teaching (Lea, 2004). This
approach fulﬁlls the emerging trend of ﬂipped class-
room (Europass Teacher Academy, 2020), where
students are responsible for their own learning be-
fore attending classes (Ng, 2018). The sessions
help to bridge the gap in knowledge between stu-
dents and the instructors. It was essential to be
aware that not all the students had the same level
of programming experience. Hence, it was essen-
tial to provide the practical sessions in stages that
could address the beginner, intermediate and expe-
rienced developers. Students were given tasks that
progressed from introductory programming with
Python for text preprocessing to introduction to • Principle 4: On the starting page (the entry
point for students to the course room), the
course syllabus is linked, and students can also
ﬁnd the course plan here, along with a weekly,
thematical breakdown of the course. In this
breakdown, we also provide links that allow
students to access all materials allotted for the 6 using Python. Therefore, there should be an alter-
native to that. given weeks. Moreover, to further enhance
the clarity in course design, the material was
added weekly to direct students’ attention to
the current tasks. Another tool provided by
Canvas and Blackboard that serves clarity is
assignments page, where students can access
all assignments in one place, enabling them to
overview what assignments they have already
fulﬁlled, what assignments are still due, and
when due dates are coming up. Text Preprocessing is an essential step in NLP
that various libraries exist for that. The main at-
tention of lecturers was on applying preprocess-
ing (such as identifying missing values, tokeniza-
tion, lemmatization, etc.) on a text ﬁle. 3.3.1
Canvas and Blackboard It did not
seem easy to apply those on Pandas dataframes. Specially applying regular expressions on Pandas
dataframe for a beginner seemed to be daunting. Though the instructors have done their job of both
concepts and practicalities, students felt less conﬁ-
dent to carry the instructor’s work and stuck using
libraries. So, one needs to develop a clear strategy
or steps for being selective in using libraries that
are more helpful for carrying real project develop-
ment. It helps to form the proper foundations for
the student. Therefore students would feel more
conﬁdent to carry forward the concepts taught by
the lecturers in a class. Similarly, when using li-
braries such as Tensorﬂow and Pytorch. • Principle 5:
The opportunity to provide
knowledge-enhancing feedback was two-fold. For one, teachers could rate and comment
on student assignments. Moreover, teachers
could provide feedback through the various
forums on the course’s discussion page, also
hosted on Canvas and Blackboard. • Principle 5:
The opportunity to provide
knowledge-enhancing feedback was two-fold. For one, teachers could rate and comment
on student assignments. Moreover, teachers
could provide feedback through the various
forums on the course’s discussion page, also
hosted on Canvas and Blackboard. • Principle 9: The discussion page of the LMS
used also served as an open communication
channel among students and between students
and teachers. This contributes to a high degree
of interaction that is important for a supportive
learning environment. Some students had high expectations towards the
instructors that instructors should have supported
them in building a web-based or desktop NLP ap-
plication, i.e., taking the NLP course project to
technology readiness level 7. However, this was
beyond this course. 4
Results Another difﬁculty students were facing was
understanding the speech patterns in the videos
recorded by lecturers coming from different back-
grounds, and having different accents. Moreover,
there were many technical terms and idioms in the
course that are hard to capture at the ﬁrst sight. A neat solution to this can be subtitles. Adding
subtitles to recorded lectures improve speech un-
derstanding, and helps students to capture new tech-
nical terms. The NLP course (7.5 credits) was a part of the one-
year Data Science Masters program at LTU. There
were 24 students enrolled in the NLP course. The
students were from academia and industry both. Most students had a background in computer sci-
ence or engineering and thus had at least an intro-
ductory course in programming. Some students,
however, had no programming background. 4.2
Course evaluation by students The department surveys each course. Students are
asked to give a rating on a scale of 1-6 (1: strongly
disagree, 6: strongly agree). Students are encour-
aged to provide feedback; however, it is up to them
if they want to give the feedback or not. Here, we
discuss the students’ reﬂections we received after
the course. In total, eight students gave their re-
sponses in the course evaluation report out of the
twenty-four students taking the course. The survey
consists of six sections: self-assessment, course
aims and content, quality of teaching, course mate-
rials, examination, and overall assessment. Table 1 shows the stats of students′ self-
assessment. It can be noticed that many students
did not spend sufﬁcient effort. In a way, we failed
in motivating students to put their efforts into the
course. It may be due to students’ other commit-
ments. However, the fact remains that we could
not manage students to put enough effort into the
course. Thus, we need to think about how we can
improve more in this regard. The following questions (Table 2) were asked
regarding ILOs of the course, to ensure that the
course design and implementation adhere to one
aspect of the principle of constructive alignment
(i.e. the teaching and learning activities support
the ILOs), as well as that Principles 1 (Emphasize
relevant knowledge and skill) and 4 (Ensure clarity
in course design) were at least partially fulﬁlled. While the last question partially reﬂected in Princi-
ple 9 as well (Create a supportive learning environ-
ment). The average scores for these statements are
between 4.25 and 4.9, suggesting that students on
average agree with the given statements, thus we
have managed to achieve these goals in the design
and delivery of the course. The lowest agreement
was given for the third statement, thus our main ob-
jective for the upcoming installment of the course
will be to ensure that the study guide provides bet-
ter guidance for the students. Lastly, the overall assessment of the course by
students is shown in Table 4. While, the overall
scores are encouraging for us (in particular the
question regarding the overall impression of stu-
dents about the course - Question 4.3), there is still
scope for improvement in all sections, and our goal
for future installments of the course is to achieve
even higher student satisfaction scores. 5
Conclusion and Improvements planned
for the future versions of the course Here, we discuss the course and the improvements
we plan for the future course. 4.1
A student’s perspective of the course Another way to address the score is to
communicate more clearly towards students that
building a complete web-based or desktop NLP
application is beyond the scope of this introductory
course. Another area where there is more room for
improvement is regarding the input of instructors
supporting student learning (Question 3.1). • Motivating students to build their own models,
and its customization. • Motivating students to build their own models,
and its customization. • Motivating students to build their own models,
and its customization. 4.1
A student’s perspective of the course This course came with various interesting points
from students’ perspectives. Such as: This section is the work of a student who took the
course and gave his comments, as discussed below. Keeping in mind that students need to be pre-
pared for both the industry and research front. Stu-
dents need to focus on using tools and methods
that are most widely used. When there are so many
tools to deal with, students get overburdened. Here,
the instructor needs to follow a suitable pathway
to let students understand the concept and imple-
ment an executable project for demonstration. The
class contains students with both programming and
non-programming backgrounds. Python was used
in the project assignments. The students without a
programming background may not feel conﬁdent • Efﬁcient knowledge transfer. • To make the student feel conﬁdent at the end
of the course by applying theoretical and prac-
tical aspects learned in the course. • Removing the barrier for students coming
from different cultures, different backgrounds. • In initial stages, sticking to most widely
used programming language and libraries and
ecosystem in NLP. At the same time, being 7 selective in libraries, which are more useful in
day-to-day project/coding implementations. Moreover, it is also measured here, how well adher-
ence to some of LTUs principles was implemented. It can once again be noted here that all average val-
ues are above 3.5, thus students are more inclined
to agree with the given statements than they are
to disagree with them. In particular, they rate the
alignment between the examination and ILOs (and
thus the adherence to constructive alignment) quite
high. The second highest score was given for the
technical support and communication, suggesting
that this aspect of creating a supportive learning
environment (Principle 9) was rather successful. The score given for the rewarding nature of theoret-
ical teaching and learning activities was only one
decimal lower, which suggests that in this aspect,
we were successful in emphasizing relevant knowl-
edge and skill (Principle 1). However, the score
concerning the practical aspects of teaching and
learning activities was considerably lower (though
still closer to six than one), suggesting that there
is more room for improvement in terms of practi-
cal tasks and assignments, as some comments also
conﬁrmed. 5.1
Conclusion This paper discusses how the course was designed,
organized, and delivered online at the university. We followed the pedagogy principles in all these
phases of the course. We argue that we can deliver
the course fully online even after the pandemic as
we delivered the course up to a satisfactory level. To be precise, we hypothesized that our course Another set of questions were asked for the eval-
uation of course delivery, and the exam conducted
(see Table 3). For one, these questions measure an-
other aspect of the constructive alignment (i.e. the
alignment of assessment with ILOs - Question 3.5). 8 Table 1: Students′ self-assessment regarding the NLP course No. Question

could be veriﬁed from the students’ response re-

2, and 3 also support our hypothesis. However,
there is always room for improvement. We ﬁgured
out many things to improve even before the course
was ﬁnished. The students’ response report gave
us a clear idea of where to put more energy to im-
prove the course, e.g., as observed from Table 3,
we will improve on teachers’ efforts and projects
related activities. The planned improvements are
listed below. 5.2
Improvements planned Here we discuss the improvements planned for fu-
ture iterations of the course based on student feed-
back and pedagogical principles. 5.2.1
Two-layered course • Splitting the project into subtasks aligned with
the NLP pipeline. Our course design started to be for multiple initia-
tives, for people from the industry and people from
academia, people with no background in AI and
maths, and people with a strong background. This
ended up in designing a general course that can
be used for all people with different backgrounds
and goals. One track of 3 credits for industrial
students and one track of 7.5 credits for academic
students. Although this idea never came to real life,
we would like to mention our ﬁnal thoughts of it as
one of the possible future works. • More live sessions to support students’ learn-
ing. • Giving more to the point references to the
content related to the theory and project im-
plementation. • A tutorial on speciﬁc libraries to use during
the course and their setup. Students from the industry most often have dif-
ferent backgrounds, limited knowledge in mathe-
matics, and stronger motivation, looking for spe-
ciﬁc applications. On the other hand, academic
students have a better knowledge of mathematics. They have sufﬁcient background in the ﬁeld and are
interested in learning a broad range of applications
and topics. • Additional tutorial on building a usable web
app, e.g., for Hate speech detection, where
anyone can feed a text and classify it. We hope that future versions of the course will
be better in all aspects (planning, designing, orga-
nizing, and conducting) and perspectives. Thus, we designed the course to cover theories,
concepts, applications, and their implementation. For example, for a topic like neural networks, the
materials should include mathematical background,
practical usage, and possible tweaks and conﬁgu-
rations. The choice of two tracks will be taking
theoretical subtopics only for academics and prac-
ticalities for both. In the end, all who ﬁnish the
course have a broad understanding of various ap-
plications in NLP that should satisfy their interests. 5.2.2
Other Improvements • Better naming convention of the videos for
clarity • Adding subtitles to the videos for better un-
derstanding (the video lectures are delivered
in English, but none of the lecturers are native
speakers). • Adding quizzes between videos for better stu-
dent activation and learning. • Removing handwritten notes from the lecture
videos and slides, as in some cases students
found that difﬁcult to read. • Multiple practical tasks with different levels
of difﬁculty can be provided to cater to the
students’ different levels of programming ex-
perience, so each student can pick the task
applicable to them. References Apoorv Agarwal. 2013. Teaching the basics of nlp and

Article: One or more embodiments include determining whether the CP solver can return a CP solution based on the CP data model and the CP search directive (Operation 504). The CP solver 132 applies one or more constraint programming techniques to the CP data model, guided by the CP search directive. The CP solver 132 determines a CP solution based on the CP data model and the CP search directive, or determines that no CP solution that satisfies all hard constraints of the CP data model exists.
As an example, a CP solver may traverse each of a set of task elements specified by a CP data model to determine a CP solution. The CP solver may begin with a particular task element. A value from the domain of the particular task element is preliminarily assigned to the particular task element. If this preliminary assignment violates a constraint specified by the CP data model, then another value from the domain of the particular task element is preliminarily assigned to the particular task element. If all values from the domain of the particular task element are attempted and do not satisfy the constraint, then re-assignment of one or more task elements previously traversed is performed. In particular, a value from the domain of a previously-traversed task element was preliminarily assigned to the previously-traversed task element. Based on the need for re-assignment, another value from the domain of the previously-traversed task element is now preliminarily assigned to the previously-traversed task element. Then, assignment of the particular task element is re-attempted.
 Additionally, the CP solver may be guided by a CP search directive. The CP search directive may determine a sequence in which time windows are attempted for assignment to one or more task elements. If assignment of Time Window A to a particular maintenance task is attempted before Time Window B, and a valid CP solution is found, then the assignment of Time Window A is finalized, regardless of whether assignment of Time Window B would have arrived at a valid CP solution. Hence, assignment of Time Window A is prioritized over Time Window B.
Hence, the CP solver may traverse each task element, until each task element is assigned a time window from the respective domain, without violating the constraints. The CP solver may determine the preliminary assignments as final assignments. The final assignments constitute a CP solution.
Alternatively, the CP solver may traverse each task element, until assignment of each time window to the task elements is attempted, and yet none of the assignments satisfy the constraints. Then, the CP solver may determine that there is no valid CP solution for the CP data model. The CP solver may return a message indicating that no CP solution exists.
In an embodiment, the CP solver 132 updates domains of data model elements as the CP solver 132 traverses and assigns values to the data model elements. The CP solver 132 removes values from domains that are no longer possible, given the preliminary assignments made thus far. The CP solver 132 removes values from the domains that would violate any hard constraints in the data model.
 As an example, a CP solver may update a domain of a task element based on task counts for a set of time elements. When a maximum task count for a particular time element is reached, a particular time window represented by the particular time element may be removed from all domains of the task elements. Hence, as the CP solver traverses a next task element, assignment of the particular time window to the next task element is not possible.
In an embodiment, certain time window restrictions are used. The CP solver 132 updates domains of data model elements, while traversing through the data model elements, based on the time window restrictions.
As an example, a time window restriction may require that certain task elements be assigned with a same time window. A CP solver may make a preliminary assignment of a particular time window to one task element. Then the CP solver removes from the domain of the other task element all time windows except the particular time window. Hence, the only possible time window available for assignment is the particular time window. Both task elements would be assigned to the same time window.
As another example, a time window restriction may require that certain task elements be assigned with different time windows. A CP solver may make a preliminary assignment of a particular time window to one task element. Then the CP solver removes the particular time window from the domain of the other task element. Hence, the particular time window is not available for being assigned to the other task element. The two task elements would be assigned different time windows.
 As another example, a time window restriction may require that certain task elements be assigned with a particular sequence of time windows-a time window assigned to T[i] must be before a time window assigned to T[j]. A CP solver may make a preliminary assignment of a particular time window to T[i]. Then the CP solver removes, from the domain of T[j], (a) the particular time window, and (b) all time windows that are before the particular time window. Hence, the only possible time windows for assigning to T[j] are after the particular time window. Alternatively, a CP solver may make a preliminary assignment of a particular time window to T[j]. Then the CP solver removes, from the domain of T[i], (a) the particular time window, and (b) all time windows that are after the particular time window. Hence, the only possible time windows for assigning to T[i] are before the particular time window.
If no CP solution is returned, then one or more embodiments include using the last-determined CP solution to return a proposed maintenance schedule (Operation 514). Since no CP solution is returned in the current iteration, the CP solver 132 retrieves the CP solution returned in the last iteration. The CP solver 132 identifies the CP solution from the last iteration as the last-determined CP solution. The CP solver 132 also identifies the CP solution from the last iteration as the CP solution associated with the lowest total cost value (compared to other CP solutions based on the data model generated at Operation 324).
 Based on the last-determined CP solution, the CP solver 132 determines whether any task elements are assigned with the overflow time window. Maintenance tasks represented by task elements assigned with the overflow time window are not included in the proposed maintenance schedule. For the remaining task elements, the CP solver 132 determines the time window assigned to each task element. Based on assignment of a time window to a task element, the CP solver 132 returns a proposed maintenance schedule indicating that the maintenance task represented by the task element is scheduled for performance during the assigned time window.
If a CP solution is returned, then one or more embodiments include determining whether an interrupt to the iterative process has been received (Operation 506). As illustrated, Operations 502-512 form an iterative process for finding a CP solution associated with a lowest total cost value. A user and/or an application may interrupt the iterative process. As an example, a user may indicate via a user interface that the user desires a best CP solution determined thus far, without waiting for the iterative process to complete.
If an interrupt is received, then one or more embodiments include using the last-determined CP solution to return a proposed maintenance schedule (Operation 514). Since a CP solution is returned in the current iteration, the CP solver 132 identifies the CP solution from the current iteration as the last-determined CP solution. Examples of operations for determining a proposed maintenance schedule based on a CP solution are described above with reference to Operation 514.
 The last-determined CP solution is not necessarily the CP solution associated with the lowest total cost value. A request to resume the iterative process for determining the CP solution associated with the lowest total cost value may be received. In response to the resumption request, the iterative process may continue at Operation 508.
If an interrupt is not received, then one or more embodiments include identifying the total cost value associated with the CP solution as a “current-minimum total cost value” (Operation 508). The CP solver 132 identifies the total cost value assigned to the total cost element associated with the CP solution obtained at Operation 504. The total cost value is identified as a “current-minimum total cost value.”

One or more embodiments include removing, from the domain of the total cost element, any values greater than or equal to the current-minimum total cost value (Operation 510). The CP solver 132 uses the current-minimum total cost value as an upper bound on the possible total cost values to be assigned to the total cost element during a next iteration. The CP solver 132 removes, from the domain of the total cost element, any values greater than or equal to the current-minimum total cost value.
 As an example, during a current iteration, the CP solver may return a current CP solution. The current CP solution may indicate that the total cost element is assigned with a total cost value of 450. The CP solver may determine 450 as the current-minimum total cost value. The CP solver may determine that a current domain of the total cost element is 1100, 200, 300, 450, 20001. The CP solver may remove, from the domain of the total cost element, any total cost values greater than or equal to 450. Hence, the CP solver may modify the domain of the total cost element to become {100, 200, 300}.
One or more embodiments include modifying the CP data model (Operation 512). The CP solver 132 modifies the CP data model to include the total cost element with the reduced domain. Based on Operation 510, the domain of the total cost element includes only total cost values that are below the current-minimum total cost value.
 The CP solver 132 iterates Operations 502-512 with respect to the modified CP data model. At Operation 502, the CP solver 132 accepts the CP data model that has been modified as an input parameter. At Operations 504-508, assuming that the CP solver 132 determines a new CP solution based on the modified CP data model, the CP solver 132 updates the current-minimum total cost value. The CP solver 132 identifies a total cost value assigned to the total cost element associated with the new CP solution as the current-minimum total cost value. At Operation 510, the CP solver 132 removes, from the domain of the total cost element, any values greater than or equal to the current-minimum total cost value. At Operation 512, the CP solver 132 once again modifies the CP data model. The CP solver 132 continues the iterative process until the CP solver cannot find a CP solution at Operation 504, or an interrupt is received at Operation 506. As described above with reference to Operation 514, when the CP 132 solver cannot find a CP solution at Operation 504, or an interrupt is received at Operation 506, the CP solver 132 uses the last-determined CP solution to return a proposed maintenance schedule.
In one or more embodiments, additional and/or alternative operations for applying a constraint programming data model and search directive to a constraint programming solver may be performed, examples of which are described below.
 In an embodiment, before a first application of the CP data model to the CP solver 132 at Operation 502, the CP data model is modified. A particular value within the range of possible total cost values, in the domain of the total cost element, is determined as an initial cutoff value. The initial cutoff value may be, for example, a median of the possible total cost values. All values above the initial cutoff value are removed from the domain of the total cost element. Hence, a first run of the CP solver 132 is required to generate a CP solution with a total cost value below the initial cutoff value. By setting the initial cutoff value, the CP solver 132 may more efficiently arrive at a CP solution with a lower total cost value, if a valid CP solution exists.
In an embodiment, the CP solver 132 iterates until all possible CP solutions, for the data model generated at Operation 324, are found. The CP solver 132 does not modify the domain of the total cost element based on a prior iteration. Hence, the CP solver 132 may find a CP solution with a higher total cost value than a prior CP solution. After determining all possible CP solutions, the CP solver 132 compares the total cost values associated with each possible CP solution. The CP solver 132 then identifies the CP solution with the lowest total cost value.
 In an embodiment, multiple CP solutions may be associated with a same lowest total cost value. The iterative process may be modified to determine such CP solutions. At Operation 510, remove from the domain of the total cost element any values greater than the current-minimum total cost value (but keep any value equal to the current-minimum total cost value). At Operation 504, the CP solver attempts to find a CP solution that has not yet been found. If no further CP solutions can be found, then at Operation 514, the set of last-determined CP solutions with the same total cost value are identified. One CP solution is selected from the set of last-determined CP solutions with the same total cost value. Any selection criteria may be used. As an example, a CP solver may determine a difference between (a) each proposed maintenance schedule generated from each of the set of last-determined CP solutions and (b) the current maintenance schedule. The proposed maintenance schedule with the least difference is selected. As another example, a CP solver may determine a number of task elements assigned with an overflow time window in each of the set of last-determined CP solutions. A CP solution with the lowest number of tasks elements assigned with the overflow time window may be selected. The selected CP solution may be used to generate a proposed maintenance schedule.
FIG. 6 illustrates an example set of operations for presenting and executing a proposed maintenance schedule, in accordance with one or more embodiments.
 One or more embodiments include presenting, at a graphical user interface (GUI), a proposed maintenance schedule (Operation 602). A GUI 138 presents the proposed maintenance schedule determined at Operation 514. The GUI 138 may overlay the proposed maintenance schedule over a current maintenance schedule. An example GUI overlaying a proposed maintenance schedule on of a current maintenance schedule is described below with reference to FIG. 7B.
One or more embodiments include determining whether user input accepting the proposed maintenance schedule has been received (Operation 604). The GUI 138 presents an interface element configured to receive user input accepting, rejecting, and/or modifying the proposed maintenance schedule. The GUI 138 determines whether any such user input has been received via the interface element.
In one or more embodiments, user input accepting the proposed maintenance schedule is not necessary. The proposed maintenance schedule output from the CP solver is adopted without human intervention.
If user input has accepted the proposed maintenance schedule, one or more embodiments include generating a set of instructions for performing the set of maintenance tasks based on the proposed maintenance schedule (Operation 606). A set of instructions for performing the set of maintenance tasks based on the proposed maintenance schedule is generated.
In an embodiment, instructions for performing each maintenance task is obtained from a data repository. Additional instructions are determined, specified, and/or obtained for scheduling execution of the instructions for performing each maintenance task according to the proposed maintenance schedule. The instructions are executable by at least one device including a hardware processor.
 As an example, a first maintenance task may be to update Software X on Server X. The first maintenance task is implemented by a set of instructions that loads and installs Software X updates on Server X. A second maintenance task may be to update Software Y on Server Y. The second maintenance task is implemented by a set of instructions that loads and installs Software Y updates on Server Y.
A master server may obtain a proposed maintenance schedule from a CP solver. The proposed maintenance schedule may indicate that the first maintenance task is scheduled for 9 am and the second maintenance task is scheduled for 10 am. Based on the proposed maintenance schedule, the master server may generate instructions for performing the first maintenance task and the second maintenance task according to the proposed maintenance schedule. The master server may generate instructions to execute the instructions of the first maintenance task (loading and installing Software X updates on Server X) at 9 am. The master server may generate instructions to execute the instructions of the second maintenance task (loading and installing Software Y updates on Server Y) at 10 am.
One or more embodiments include performing the set of maintenance tasks according to the proposed maintenance schedule (Operation 608). One or more maintenance resources accept the set of instructions generated at Operation 606. Based on the set of instructions, the maintenance resources perform the set of maintenance tasks according to the proposed maintenance schedule.
 As an example, a proposed maintenance schedule may indicate that a first maintenance task is scheduled for 9 am and a second maintenance task is scheduled for 10 am. A master server may generate instructions for performing the first maintenance task at 9 am and the second maintenance task at 10 am. The master server may execute the instructions. According to the instructions, the master server may perform the first maintenance task at 9 am and the second maintenance task at 10 am.
As another example, a proposed maintenance schedule may indicate that a first maintenance task is scheduled for 9 am and a second maintenance task is scheduled for 10 am. A group of workers may view the proposed maintenance schedule at a GUI. Based on the proposed maintenance schedule, a worker may determine to perform the first maintenance task at 9 am. Another worker may determine to perform the second maintenance task at 10 am.
If user input has not accepted the proposed maintenance schedule, one or more embodiments include generating a set of instructions for performing the set of maintenance tasks based on the current maintenance schedule (Operation 610). Examples for generating a set of instructions for performing maintenance tasks based on a schedule are described above with reference to Operation 606.
One or more embodiments include performing the set of maintenance tasks according to the current maintenance schedule (Operation 612). Examples for performing the set of maintenance tasks according to a schedule are described above with reference to Operation 608.

5. Hardware Overview

According to one embodiment, the techniques described herein are implemented by one or more special-purpose computing devices. The special-purpose computing devices may be hard-wired to perform the techniques, or may include digital electronic devices such as one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or network processing units (NPUs) that are persistently programmed to perform the techniques, or may include one or more general purpose hardware processors programmed to perform the techniques pursuant to program instructions in firmware, memory, other storage, or a combination. Such special-purpose computing devices may also combine custom hard-wired logic, ASICs, FPGAs, or NPUs with custom programming to accomplish the techniques. The special-purpose computing devices may be desktop computer systems, portable computer systems, handheld devices, networking devices or any other device that incorporates hard-wired and/or program logic to implement the techniques.
For example, FIG. 8 is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system 800 upon which an embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Computer system 800 includes a bus 802 or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a hardware processor 804 coupled with bus 802 for processing information. Hardware processor 804 may be, for example, a general purpose microprocessor.
 Computer system 800 also includes a main memory 806, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 802 for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor 804. Main memory 806 also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor 804. Such instructions, when stored in non-transitory storage media accessible to processor 804, render computer system 800 into a special-purpose machine that is customized to perform the operations specified in the instructions.
Computer system 800 further includes a read only memory (ROM) 808 or other static storage device coupled to bus 802 for storing static information and instructions for processor 804. A storage device 810, such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus 802 for storing information and instructions.
Computer system 800 may be coupled via bus 802 to a display 812, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device 814, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus 802 for communicating information and command selections to processor 804. Another type of user input device is cursor control 816, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor 804 and for controlling cursor movement on display 812. This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.
 Computer system 800 may implement the techniques described herein using customized hard-wired logic, one or more ASICs or FPGAs, firmware and/or program logic which in combination with the computer system causes or programs computer system 800 to be a special-purpose machine. According to one embodiment, the techniques herein are performed by computer system 800 in response to processor 804 executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory 806. Such instructions may be read into main memory 806 from another storage medium, such as storage device 810. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory 806 causes processor 804 to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions.
The term “storage media” as used herein refers to any non-transitory media that store data and/or instructions that cause a machine to operate in a specific fashion. Such storage media may comprise non-volatile media and/or volatile media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device 810. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory 806. Common forms of storage media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, solid state drive, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic data storage medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical data storage medium, any physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, NVRAM, any other memory chip or cartridge, content-addressable memory (CAM), and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM).
 Storage media is distinct from but may be used in conjunction with transmission media. Transmission media participates in transferring information between storage media. For example, transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus 802. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.
Various forms of media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 804 for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk or solid state drive of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system 800 can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus 802. Bus 802 carries the data to main memory 806, from which processor 804 retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory 806 may optionally be stored on storage device 810 either before or after execution by processor 804.
 Computer system 800 also includes a communication interface 818 coupled to bus 802. Communication interface 818 provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link 820 that is connected to a local network 822. For example, communication interface 818 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, cable modem, satellite modem, or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface 818 may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface 818 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.
Network link 820 typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link 820 may provide a connection through local network 822 to a host computer 824 or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 826. ISP 826 in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the “Internet” 828. Local network 822 and Internet 828 both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link 820 and through communication interface 818, which carry the digital data to and from computer system 800, are example forms of transmission media.
Computer system 800 can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link 820 and communication interface 818. In the Internet example, a server 830 might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet 828, ISP 826, local network 822 and communication interface 818.
 The received code may be executed by processor 804 as it is received, and/or stored in storage device 810, or other non-volatile storage for later execution.

Processing sample 92 (dataset index 91) with language 'en'
Article: The cover 79 includes a lower gripping portion 83 that is configured to facilitate a facility occupant gripping the cover 79 to rotate the cover upward to access the button 75. In the embodiment of FIG. 2F, the lower gripping portion 83 extends between upper surfaces of the sides of the cover to provide access to a rear surface of the lower gripping portion 83. In other words, the lower gripping portion 83 is disposed and configured to enable a facility occupant to place one or more fingers under the lower gripping portion 83 and thereby grasp the lower gripping portion 83 to rotate the cover 79 upward to provide access to the button 75. The lower gripping portion can include structures to facilitate a facility occupant's understanding as to how to rotate the cover 79 to expose the button 75. In some of these embodiments, the lower gripping portion 83 includes indicia to facilitate this operation, such as “LIFT HERE.”

Many of the actuators disclosed above are statically or otherwise permanently mounted, and in particular mounted on static objects. Providing the actuators at permanent or semi-permanent locations may be beneficial because it provides the facility occupants with the opportunity to be aware of the actuator locations, so that the facility occupants can efficiently locate the actuators when needed.
 It may be especially beneficial to dispose the permanently or semi-permanently mounted actuators at numerous locations throughout the facility to enable the facility occupants to efficiently, easily, and quickly access the actuators if necessary. In some of these embodiments, these benefits are further enhanced by disposing the actuators at locations that are easily accessed by large numbers of facility occupants, such as at along common hallways, hubs of hallways, areas frequented by large numbers of facility occupants, etc. The actuators can be dispersed throughout the facility so that adjacent actuators are spaced apart by a maximum distance. For example, the actuators can be distributed throughout the facility so that the maximum distance separating adjacent actuators is 50 feet, which increases the likelihood of swift and easy access to an actuator.
As disclosed above, the actuators can be configured to facilitate swift and easy identification and recognition by facility occupants, and to be distinguishable from other apparatus, such as fire alarm pull stations. As one example, portions of the actuators can be colored to enhance identification and recognition. For example, portions of the actuator, such as the button, can be colored bright green and/or blue. In addition, various indicia can be provided on the actuator, such as “LOCKDOWN” or “LOCKDOWN ALARM” to identify the actuator, and “PUSH” to identify the button. It would be beneficial to provide the indicia with lettering of a sufficient size to enhance identification, such as using uppercase letters that are at least 2 inches high. It would also be beneficial to provide the indicia in a color that enhances its recognizability. For example, if the indicia is provided on a base or button that is dark in color, then the indicia should be light in color, such as white.
 It would also be beneficial for the button of the various embodiments to be a sufficient size to facilitate its identification as well as its operation. In other words, the button should be large enough so that it is easily recognizable by facility occupants, and is easy to push even under circumstances where the facility occupant is subjected to high stress. In some of these embodiments that include a circular button, the button has a diameter of four to seven inches. In some of these embodiments that include a rectangular button, each side of the button has a length of four to seven inches.
Actuation of some of the actuator disclosed above require or otherwise involve all or portions of the actuator moving, such as in a direction perpendicular to a front exterior surface of the actuator. However, embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover other types of actuators or actuating mechanisms. For example, some actuators may include electronic actuation mechanisms, such as touch screen displays. For example, a virtual button can be provided on a display, such that touching the virtual button constitutes actuation, i.e., results in transmission of the lockdown initiation signal. However, still other embodiments include similar but different actuators, including all known, related art and later developed actuation mechanisms. It may be beneficial for any or all of these electronic and/or other actuation mechanisms to be complimented by a cover or other mechanism to impede, reduce or prevent unintended actuations. For example, some of the actuators that transmit the lockdown initiation signal via a touch screen display may include a cover, such as any of the covers disclosed above, to impede, reduce or prevent unintended actuations.
 The actuators are disclosed above in the context of being permanently and statically mounted. However, actuators of other embodiments can be configured to be mobile. In many of these embodiments, the actuators are configured to be carried by facility occupants. Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any configuration that facilitates or makes convenient the carrying of the mobile actuators. For example, the mobile actuator can be configured as a pendant and thus hung around the neck of a facility occupant, or as a bracelet hung around the wrist. In still other embodiments, the mobile actuator is configured to be clipped or otherwise attached to the facility occupant's cloths, attached to a facility occupant's key chain, etc. In many of these embodiments, the actuator is small in size, such as a size defined by a 3 inch diameter in the case of circular actuators, or 3 inches by 3 inches in the case of square actuators.
 In addition to being configured to make it easy and convenient for facility occupants to carry the mobile actuators, they may also be configured to impede or prevent unintentional actuations. For example, the mobile actuators may include some or all of the structures, or similar structures, disclosed above to impede or prevent unnecessary actuations in the context of static actuators. For example, the mobile actuators may only transmit the lockdown initiation signal following application of a sufficient amount of force, application of force for a sufficient period, application for force in a sufficiently perpendicular direction, etc. In addition or as an alternative to the above structures, the mobile actuators can be configured to include other mechanisms to avoid unintentional actuations, such as multiple buttons. In some of these embodiments, the mobile actuators only transmit the lockdown initiation signal if two separate buttons are pressed simultaneously. In some of these embodiments, the two buttons are disposed on opposite sides of the mobile actuator to reduce the likelihood of inadvertent actuations as well as to enhance the ease of intended actuations. In other embodiments, one of the buttons is disposed on a side of the mobile actuator, and the other button is disposed on a front or rear face.
 As another alternative to the embodiments that include buttons that must be simultaneously pressed for actuation, other embodiments include two separate mechanisms that include a safety mechanism and an actuation mechanism. For example, the mobile actuators of some of these embodiments can include a safety switch that must be toggled or otherwise moved into an active state. In the active state, pressing or otherwise actuating the actuation mechanism, such as a button, will only cause the mobile actuator to transmit the lockdown initiation signal if the safety switch is in the active state. Contrarily, pressing or otherwise actuating the actuation mechanism, such as a button, will not cause the mobile actuator to transmit the lockdown initiation signal if the safety switch is in an inactive state. Some of these embodiments include safety mechanism similar to those included in weapons, such as guns.
Various aspects of the mobile actuators can be configured to facilitate ease of use, etc. For example, the separate buttons or mechanisms can include indicia, different colors, etc., to make them more recognizable or their operation more understandable to facility occupants. The mobile actuations are also intended to include or otherwise cover any of the other structures, mechanisms, etc., disclosed above in the context of static actuators, including colors, indicia, etc.
Some embodiments include or otherwise cover selectively providing mobile actuators to only certain facility occupants, or types of facility occupants. Determining the facility occupants or types of facility occupants who are to be provided with the mobile actuators can be based on a balancing of multiple issues, such as tendency for unintentional actuations, likelihood of intended actuations, speed or ease of actuating a static/permanently mounted actuator, etc.
 For example, in the context of a school, typical students may not be provided with mobile actuators to impede, reduce or prevent unintended actuations. However, in some embodiments, certain students may be provided with mobile actuators, such as students who are disabled or otherwise unable to access static/permanently mounted actuators. In some of these embodiments, all teachers and/or other adult school officials may be provided with mobile actuators to enhance the speed and ease with which intended actuations can be performed. In some other embodiments, only certain teachers or school officials may be provided with mobile actuators to impede, reduce or prevent unintended actuations. In other words, the likelihood of unintended actuations is decreased by reducing the number of mobile actuators.
The determination as to which teachers or school officials are to be provided with mobile actuators can be based on various factors. For example, a certain number of teachers per region of the school can be provided with the mobile actuators, which will provide the ability to transmit the lockdown initiation signal if the static/permanently mounted actuators in that region of the school cannot be accessed or if such access becomes difficult. As another example, teachers who are not located proximate static/permanently mounted actuators can be provided with mobile actuators, such as teachers who are outside of the school, e.g., at recess, physical education, etc.
 B. Annunciator

The at least one annunciator 5 can include any structure or configuration to perform the operation of communicating initiation of lockdown procedures to individuals at or in proximity to the facility upon receipt of the activation signal. It may be especially beneficial for the audible communication of lockdown procedures to be distinguishable from the audible communication of other conditions, such as a fire alarm, for reasons disclosed above. It may also be beneficial for the annunciator to be structurally distinguishable from other annunciators, such as fire alarm annunciators, to enhance the facility occupants' ability to distinguish the lockdown audible annunciation from other audible annunciations, such as a fire alarm audible annunciation.
FIG. 3A is a schematic of an annunciator in accordance with one exemplary embodiment. The annunciator 5 of FIG. 3A defines a circular front exterior face 101, which may be beneficial based on its similarity in shape to the exemplary actuator 3 shown in FIG. 2A. For example, sharing the same circular shape may enhance the facility occupants' ability to more easily recognize that the source of the audible annunciation, i.e., the annunciator 5, communicates initiation of lockdown procedures, as opposed to other procedures, such as a fire alarm. The annunciator 5 may also share the same or similar color (such as blue) as the actuator 3 or other components of the lockdown system for the same reason, i.e., to facilitate the facility occupants' recognition of the audible communication of the lockdown procedures as opposed to other procedures, such as a fire alarm. In fact, providing any or all of the components of the lockdown systems disclosed herein with the same or similar shapes, colors, etc., may also provide these benefits.
 In addition or as an alternative to the above physical characteristics of the annunciator 5 that make it more easily distinguishable for other facility systems, such as a fire alarm, the annunciator 5 can include indicia identifying it as part of the lockdown system. For example, in the embodiment of FIG. 3A, the annunciator includes the indicia “LOCKDOWN” 103 at the top and bottom of its front exterior face 101 to enhance the ability of facility occupants to recognize that the source of the audible annunciation is the lockdown annunciator 5.
Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any known, related art, or later developed technologies for enabling, facilitating, and/or causing the communication of the audible lockdown annunciation upon receipt of the activation signal. In many embodiments, some of all of the components that generate the audible annunciation, including but not limited to speakers, electronics, etc., are disposed within a body or casing 105 of the annunciator 5. This configuration may be beneficial by shielding or protecting the audio generating components from damage. In fact, in some embodiments, some or all of these components can be reinforced to prevent damage, such as may result from the intentional actions of an individual whose actions create the circumstances warranting the lockdown. For example, some embodiments include shielding or other protective mechanisms to reduce, minimize or avoid damage to these components that could result from fire arms or other intentional external forces.
 The body or casing 105 can include structure(s) to facilitate communication of the audible annunciation that are generated by the components disposed within the body or casing 105 to the facility occupants. For example, the embodiment of FIG. 3A includes slits 107 that extend through the front face 101 that facilitate the travel of sound waves that are generated within the body or casing 105 to outside of the body or casing 105. The embodiment of FIG. 3A includes multiple slits, however embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any number of slits (including only a single slit). The slits do not need to be defined in the front face 101, and instead can be defined in any of the other surfaces of the body or casing 105, such as in the sides thereof, which may be beneficial in certain circumstances, such as where the annunciator 5 is mounted on the wall of a hallway or other elongated space, which may facilitate the travel of the sound waves along the hallway or elongated space. Other embodiments do not include elongated slits, and instead include non-elongated holes defined in any of the walls of the body or casing 105, such as circular shaped holes.
 The body or casing 105 can be configured for mounting to any relevant surface, such as a static surface. In some of these embodiments, the body or casing 105 is configured for mounting to a wall of the facility. In many such embodiments, it may be preferable to mount the annunciator 5 sufficiently high on the wall to reduce the likelihood of the annunciator being subjected to intentional tampering or accidental contacts. In other embodiments, the body or casing 5 is configured for mounting to a ceiling of the facility, which may be beneficial for various reasons, such as reducing the likelihood of the annunciator being subjected to intentional tampering or accidental contacts, enhancing the travel of sound waves, ease of wiring at installation, etc.
FIG. 3B is a schematic of an annunciator in accordance with an alternative exemplary embodiment. The alternative annunciator 109 of FIG. 3B includes a rectangular casing 111, and circular holes 113 extending through the exterior face of the casing 111. In this embodiment, the holes 113 are arranged in a circular configuration which may be beneficial for reasons disclosed above with regard to the circular casing 101 of FIG. 3A. Specifically, sharing the same circular shape as the actuator 3 may enhance the facility occupants' ability to more easily recognize that the source of the audible annunciation, i.e., the annunciator 109, communicates initiation of lockdown procedures, as opposed to other procedures, such as a fire alarm.
 The annunciator 109 of FIG. 3B can include any of the other structures and/or operations disclosed above with regard to the annunciator 5 of FIG. 3A. For example, the annunciator 109 can include indicia, such as the word “LOCKDOWN” 115, for reasons of identification disclosed above with regard to the embodiment shown in FIG. 3A. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3B, this indicia is provided on each side 117 of the rectangular casing 111.
The annunciator 109 can include still other structures and operations not disclosed above. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3B, an indicator 114 is included to provide additional indication or confirmation to the facility occupants of initiation of lockdown procedures, which may be beneficial for a variety of reasons. For example, this additional indication may supplement the content of the annunciation (such as “LOCKDOWN, LOCKDOWN, LOCKDOWN”) to further facilitate facility occupants to distinguish the lockdown alarm from another system, such as a fire alarm. In other words, actuation of the indicator 114 enables facility occupants to better understand that the audible annunciation communicated by the annunciator 109 relates to lockdown procedures, especially based on the indicia “LOCKDOWN” 115 provided on the sides 117 of the rectangular casing 111.
 Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any indicator 114 that is configured to generate or otherwise provide any type or form of additional indication that supplements or is in some way different from the audible annunciation. In some of these embodiments, the additional indication is in the form of light, such as light generated by any of the disclosed visual indicators disclosed herein. In some other embodiments, the additional indication constitutes a form or type of indication other than light, including but not limited to indications that help to draw the attention of facility occupants to the annunciator 109 and to more clearly understand or recognize the message provided thereby.
In operation, it may be beneficial for the audible annunciation that is generated by any of the embodiments to easily and quickly obtain the attention of facility occupants, while also being distinguishable from other communications, such as a fire alarm, other announcements made over an intercom system, etc. Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any audible annunciations that satisfy the above characteristics.
 In some embodiments, the audible annunciation initiates with a loud and distinctive sound, such as an electronically generated siren, monotone, bell, chime, whoop, or other noise that obtains the attention of facility occupants. In some of these embodiments, this initial noise is brief and continuous, such as for a duration of approximately one to five seconds, and is followed by the word “lockdown,” which communicates to the facility occupants that the alarm signifies the initiation of lockdown procedures. In many of these embodiments, the word “lockdown” is repeated any number of times to enhance the facility occupants' recognition of the initiation of lockdown procedures. In some of these embodiments, the word “lockdown” is communicated three times in rapid succession. In addition, in many embodiments, the word “lockdown” is communicated in a tone to express urgency. These embodiments are especially beneficial because they quickly communicate the initiation of lockdown procedures to facility occupants, because the initial noise obtains the facility occupants' attention, and once the attention is obtained, the word(s) lockdown communicates to the facility occupants that they need to follow lockdown procedures. In some embodiments, the initial noise is generated again following communication of the word(s) “lockdown.”

The initial noise followed by the word(s) lockdown, and then in some embodiments a repetition of the initial noise, constitutes a single alarm cycle. In some embodiments, the alarm cycle is repeated any number of times, such as three or four times, to enhance the facility occupants' recognition of the initiation of lockdown procedures. It may be especially beneficial for total duration of the alarm, including all repeated cycles, to be tailored to be sufficiently long to provide enhanced recognition by the facility occupants of initiation of lockdown procedures, but to not be unduly long and thereby reduce negative impacts, i.e., creating additional chaos and/or confusion, negatively impacting positive communications, such as communications between emergency responders, facility officials, etc. Thus, the total duration of the alarm, including all repeated cycles, of many embodiments is less than approximately 90 seconds, and in some of these embodiments is between approximately 60 seconds to approximately 90 seconds. Embodiments that reset the alarm after a limited number of cycles are also beneficial because they obviate the responding authorities resetting or turning off the alarm, enabling the responding authorities to focus on the circumstances warranting the lockdown.
 C. Visual Indicator

The at least one visual indicator 7 can include any structure or configuration to perform the operation of communicating initiation of lockdown procedures to individuals at or in proximity to the facility upon receipt of the activation signal. It may be especially beneficial for the visual indication of lockdown procedures to be distinguishable from the visual indication of other conditions, such as the lights of a fire alarm strobe, for reasons disclosed above. It may also be beneficial for the visual indicator itself to be structurally distinguishable from other visual indicators, such as fire alarm visual indicators (strobes), to enhance the facility occupants' ability to distinguish the lockdown visual indication from other visual indications, such as the fire alarm strobe.
 FIG. 4A is a schematic of a visual indicator in accordance with one exemplary embodiment. The exemplary visual indicator 7 of FIG. 4A includes a casing 121 defines a circular front exterior face, which may be beneficial based on its similarity in shape to the exemplary actuator 3 shown in FIG. 2A and annunciator shown in FIG. 3A. For example, sharing the same circular shape may enhance the facility occupants' ability to more easily recognize that the source of the visual indication, i.e., the visual indicator 7, communicates initiation of lockdown procedures, as opposed to other procedures, such as a fire alarm. The visual indicator 7 may also share the same or similar color (such as blue) as the actuator 3, annunciator 5, or other components of the lockdown system for the same reason, i.e., to facilitate the facility occupants' recognition of the visual indication of the lockdown procedures as opposed to other procedures, such as a fire alarm. In fact, providing any or all of the components of the lockdown systems disclosed herein with the same or similar shapes, colors, etc., may also provide these benefits.
In addition or as an alternative to the above physical characteristics of the visual indicator 7 that make it more easily distinguishable for other facility systems, such as a fire alarm, the visual indicator 7 can include indicia identifying it as part of the lockdown system. For example, in the embodiment of FIG. 4A, the visual indicator 7 includes the indicia “LOCKDOWN” 123 at the top of its front exterior face to enhance the ability of facility occupants to recognize that the source of the visual indication is the visual indicator 7.
 Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any known, related art, or later developed technologies for enabling, facilitating, and/or causing the generation and communication of the visual indication of lockdown upon receipt of the activation signal. In many embodiments, the visual indicator 7 includes a light generating device 125 provided under a transparent or semi-transparent cover that enables light generated within the visual indicator to be transmitted through the cover for viewing by facility occupants. The transparent or semi-transparent cover may be beneficial by protecting or shielding the light generating device 125 from damage, dirt, debris, etc.
 It may be especially beneficial for the light that is generated and communicated by the light generating device 125 to be distinguishable from light generated by other systems, such as fire alarm systems for reasons discussed above. For example, light generated by fire alarms is typically clear or not colored, and thus it may be beneficial for the light generated and communicated by the light generating device 125 to be colored. It may be especially beneficial if this colored light is consistent with color(s) used with other components of the lockdown system to facilitate the facility occupants' recognition of the visual indication of the lockdown procedures as opposed to other procedures, such as a fire alarm. For example, the light that is generated and communicated through the cover can be the same or a similar color (such as blue) as the actuator 3, annunciator 5, exterior of the visual indicator 7, or other components of the lockdown system for the same reason, i.e., to facilitate the facility occupants' recognition of the visual indication of the lockdown procedures as opposed to other procedures, such as a fire alarm. Other exemplary colors for the light and components of the lockdown system include yellow, bright green, etc.
 As an alternative to generating light of different colors, the light that is generated by the light generation device 125 can be clear and the transparent or semi-transparent cover can be colored so that the light transmitted therethrough adopts the color of the cover. This feature may be especially beneficial for product manufacturing and/or distributing purposes. For example, the same light generating device for different systems, i.e., lockdown system, fire system, etc., can be used, and ultimately installed under different covers. For example, the light generating device can be installed with a colored cover for a lockdown system, and a clear cover for a fire alarm.
It may be beneficial for the light generated and communicated by the light generation device 125 to be relatively bright to enhance recognition by facility occupants of initiation of lockdown procedures. For example, the light generation device 125 can be a strobe that utilizes Xenon with a minimum of approximately 75 candelas and a maximum of approximately 200 candelas. In addition, it may be beneficial for the light generating device to generate and communicate flashing light to enhance the facility occupants' recognition of initiation of lockdown procedures. The flash pattern of some embodiments is especially designed to obtain the attention of facility occupants. Some of these embodiments provide a flash pattern of approximately 60 flashes per minute.
 As indicated above, the annunciator of some embodiments is reset and thus ceases providing an audible annunciation after a certain period to reduce chaos, reduce interruption of communications between emergency responders, etc. However, generation of light by the light generation device 125 does not cause the same level of disruption and/or chaos as the audible annunciation. Thus, the light generation device 125 of many embodiments continues to generate and communicate light, even after the audible annunciation resets, to continue communicating that lockdown procedures are in effect. Facility occupants are thereby notified of the continuation of lockdown procedures until the lockdown is officially ended, and the visual indication manually reset or turned off.
FIG. 4B is a schematic of a visual indicator in accordance with an alternative exemplary embodiment. The visual indicator 127 of FIG. 4B includes a square housing 129 that is mountable to a static surface, such as a wall or ceiling of the facility. In this embodiment, the top and bottom of the front exterior surface of the housing 129 include the indicia “LOCKDOWN” to facilitate the facility occupants' recognition of the visual indicator 127 being a component of the lockdown system, as opposed to a different system, such as a fire alarm. The visual indicator 127 also includes a light generation device 133 provided under a cover to generate and communicate light upon initiation of lockdown procedures. Any or all of the aspects and features discussed above with regard to the visual indicator 7 of FIG. 4A are also application to the visual indicator of FIG. 4B.
 FIG. 4C is a schematic of a visual indicator in accordance with another alternative exemplary embodiment.

E. Controller

The controller 9 can include any structure or configuration to perform the operation(s) of: 1) transmitting the activation signal to the at least one annunciator 5 and/or visual indicator 7 upon receipt of the lockdown initiation signal from the actuator 3; and/or 2) transmitting the communication signal to the at least one authorized recipient 11 upon receipt of the lockdown initiation signal from the actuator 3. The controller 9 can include any structure or configuration to perform any of the operations, determinations, decisions, communications, etc., disclosed above in the context of any of the system components, including but not limited to the actuator, annunciator, and visual indicator. Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any and all known, related art, and/or later developed technologies for performing these operations.
 The controller 9 can be disposed at any location. For example, the controller 9 can be disposed at the facility, proximate the facility, or at a location that is not proximate the facility. In embodiments where the controller 9 is disposed at the facility, it may be beneficial for the controller 9 to be disposed at a secured location to reduce the likelihood of intentional tampering as well as unintentional damage, such as in an electrical closet, a facility official's office, etc. In many of these embodiments, the controller 9 may be disposed proximate other similar apparatus, such as fire alarm control panels, security system panels, HVAC controllers, electrical panels, etc. In addition, the controller 9 may be disposed within a protective cabinet, such as a locked or otherwise sealed container, to reduce the likelihood of tampering, damage, etc.
Contrarily, the control panel can be disposed at any location not proximate the facility, such as at a central monitoring station, police station, etc. In fact, the control panel can be cloud based, and/or processing can be performed by a remotely disposed server.
Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any known, related art, or later developed technologies for signal transmission to and/or from the controller 9, regardless of the location of the controller 9 For example, the signals to and/or from the controller 9 can be transmitted via wires, wirelessly, via a network, via the Internet, etc.
 F. Overall System

As disclosed above with regard to FIG. 1, upon receipt of the lockdown initiation signal from the actuator 3, the controller 9 transmits an activation signal to the at least one annunciator 5 and an activation signal to the visual indicator 7. The at least one annunciator 5 and visual indicator 7 constitute separate and discrete components that separately communicate initiation of lockdown procedures to individuals at or in proximity to the facility upon receipt of the activation signal.
1. Combined Annunciator and Visual Indicator—FIG. 6

However, the annunciator and visual indicator can be combined, as disclosed in the context of FIGS. 5A and 5B. In that case, the controller only needs to send a single activation signal to the combined annunciator and visual indicator. FIG. 6 is a schematic of a lockdown system in accordance with an alternative exemplary embodiment that includes a combined annunciator and visual indicator.
As shown in FIG. 6, manual actuation of an actuator 173 results in transmission of a lockdown initiation signal to a controller 179. Upon receipt of the lockdown initiation signal, the controller 179 transmits an activation signal to the combined annunciator and visual indicator 175. The combined annunciator and visual indicator 175 communicate initiation of lockdown procedures to individuals at or in proximity to the facility upon receipt of the activation signal. Upon receipt of the lockdown initiation signal, the controller 179 also transmits a communication signal to at least one authorized recipient 181. It is intended that the modified system of FIG. 6 include any and all of the alternative and additional features and operations that are disclosed with regard to the system shown in FIG. 1, as well as the components separately shown in the other figures.
 2. Alternative Controller—FIG. 7

As an alternative, or in addition to any of the above features, the controller of some embodiments can be integrated with, or otherwise be in communication with, other systems, controllers, and/or processors. FIG. 7 is a schematic of a lockdown system in accordance with an alternative exemplary embodiment that is integrated with, or is otherwise in communication with, another system. Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any type of system, controller, or processor, including but not limited to a fire alarm system, security system, telephone system, etc.
The lockdown system of FIG. 7 includes at least one actuator 183, at least one annunciator 185, at least one visual indicator 187, and a controller 189. The at least one actuator 183, annunciator 185, and visual indicator 187 are located at or proximate to the facility. The controller 189 can be located at or proximate to the facility, or alternatively disposed away from the facility.
In accordance with this embodiment, and similarly with the embodiment of FIG. 1, manual actuation of the actuator 183 results in transmission of a lockdown initiation signal to the controller 189. Upon receipt of the lockdown initiation signal, the controller 189 transmits an activation signal to the at least one annunciator 185 and visual indicator 187. The at least one annunciator 185 and visual indicator 187 communicate initiation of lockdown procedures to individuals at or in proximity to the facility upon receipt of the activation signal.
 Some of these embodiments are similar to the FIG. 1 embodiment, in that, upon receipt of the lockdown initiation signal, the controller 189 transmits a communication signal to at least one authorized recipient 191A. In many embodiments, the at least one authorized recipient 191A includes a centralized facility of authorized personnel for responding to emergencies, including but not limited to a police station, fire station, medical dispatch unit, etc.
However, contrary to the FIG. 1 embodiment, the controller 189 of the FIG. 7 embodiment can transmit/receive a signal, or otherwise be in communication with, another system, such as alternative controller 193. As indicated above, this alternative controller 193 can be a component of a fire alarm system, security system, telephone system, access control system, etc. Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any type of signals or communications transmitted between the controller 189 and alternative controller 193, such as data that may be relevant to either or both systems. In fact, the signals transmitted can include things other than data, such as the transmission of electrical power, including but not limited to a back-up power supply.
 In some of these embodiments, the controller 189, upon receipt of the lockdown initiation signal, transmits a communication signal indicating initiation of lockdown procedures to the alternative controller 193, which then transmits the appropriate signal to the at least one authorized recipient 191B. In many of these embodiments, the controller 189, contrary to the FIG. 1 embodiment, would therefore not directly transmit the communication signal to the at least one authorized recipient because this signal would be duplicative of the communication signal transmitted by the alternative controller 193. However, in some embodiments, both the controller 189 and the alternative controller 193 transmit communication signals indicating initiation of lockdown procedures. In some of these embodiments, the communication signals that are transmitted are different, i.e., include different data or different messaging, and/or are transmitted to different authorized recipients. However, in other embodiments, both the controller 189 and the alternative controller 193 transmit the same communication signal to the same authorized recipient, such as to ensure or otherwise enhance the chances of receipt thereof.
 3. Actuator Transmits Activation Signal—FIG. 8

As disclosed above with regard to FIG. 1, upon receipt of the lockdown initiation signal from the actuator 3, the controller 9 transmits an activation signal to the at least one annunciator 5 and an activation signal to the visual indicator 7. In some embodiments, the at least one annunciator 5 and visual indicator 7 constitute separate and discrete components that separately communicate initiation of lockdown procedures to individuals at or in proximity to the facility upon receipt of the activation signal. However, as with the embodiment of FIG. 6, these components can be combined to form a single combined annunciator and visual indicator 175, and thus the controller 179 only transmits a single activation signal to the combined annunciator and visual indicator 175.
However, the controller of some embodiments does not transmit the activation signal to the annunciator and the visual indicator, and instead these activation signal(s) can be transmitted directly from the actuator. FIG. 8 is a schematic of a lockdown system in accordance with an alternative exemplary embodiment, wherein the actuator directly transmits the activation signal to the annunciator and visual indicator.
The lockdown system of FIG. 8 includes at least one actuator 203, at least one annunciator 205, at least one visual indicator 207, and a controller 209. The at least one actuator 203, annunciator 205, and visual indicator 207 are located at or proximate to the facility. The controller 209 can be located at or proximate to the facility, or alternatively disposed away from the facility.

Article: PER CURIAM.
 The action giving rise to this appeal was filed in district court by a coalition of preservationists who sought to prevent demolition of the historic Ohio State Penitentiary in downtown Columbus and, having failed in that endeavor, now seek "an appropriate mitigation alternative for the adverse impacts upon the site" of the demolition. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), had violated a federal statute requiring federal construction projects to include measures to preserve sites of historical significance by allowing the City of Columbus to "de-federalize" a construction project (the "B-4 connector") related to a long-term federal highway construction program (the Spring/Sandusky Interchange Project or "SSI Project") and to proceed with alternative, non-federal construction that led to the razing of at least part of the state's original penitentiary buildings. After the plaintiffs presented their evidence at trial, the district court dismissed the case pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(c), holding that "the plaintiffs ha[d] failed to prove an essential element of the case, that is that B-4 was not separate and independent (from the federally-funded SSI Project)."
We review facts found by the district court as a basis for dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c) for clear error. The district court's legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. See Sharp ex rel. Estate of Sharp v. United States, 401 F.3d 440, 442 (6th Cir.2005). "Clear error will be found only where the reviewing court is left with the definite, firm conviction that a mistake has been made. The issue is not whether the district court reached the best conclusion, but whether the evidence before the court supports the district court's findings. Also, the district court's findings based on the credibility of the witnesses before it are entitled to great deference on appeal." Isabel v. City of Memphis, 404 F.3d 404, 411 (6th Cir.2005).
 Having had the benefit of oral argument, and having studied the record on appeal and the briefs of the parties, we are not persuaded that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint. The record indicates that the SSI Project was intended to complete and upgrade 1-670 at its intersection with State Route 315 in downtown Columbus. Independent of that federally funded program, the city proposed a project designed to improve traffic flow in the general area of the SSI Project. The design originally included the construction of a local road connecting Neil Avenue and Nationwide Boulevard near Front Street and was designated B-4 on project maps. The defendant's exhibits indicate that despite the appearance of the B-4 connector on SSI Project maps, it was never considered part of the larger construction program and was subject to a different environmental assessment process than that undergone by the proposed SSI construction.
 Apparently, the city had received federal funds for the B-4 connector from a source other than the SSI Project funding and in 1997, when the city initiated a new plan for the development of an arena in the same vicinity, it cancelled the B-4 connector project and returned the federal funds. As part of the arena development, another plan for dealing with local traffic was designed that necessitated the demolition of some of the penitentiary buildings, leading to the filing of this action. In their original complaint, the plaintiffs contended that the B 4 connector had been improperly segmented out of the SSI Project and that the replacement project, even though not part of the federally-funded construction, constituted an "end run" around the environmental review procedures applicable to federal highway construction such as the SSI Project. After the city razed the buildings at issue in this case, the plaintiffs supplemented their complaint, contending that the FHWA should be held responsible for mitigating the effects of the demolition of the penitentiary buildings.
However, there was no proof that the B-4 connector was ever part of the SSI Project, nor — as the district court found— could the later replacement construction, locally initiated and financed, be considered a federal project "merely because it will relieve some of the same congestion that B-4 would have."
For the reasons set out above, as well as those articulated by the district judge in granting the defendants' Rule 52 motion, we find no clear error and, therefore, AFFIRM the judgment of the district court..

In an era of international trade, the United States and Canada, is taken from the London Nineteenth Century. March number: "We all know what the United States of America are. They are equal sovereign States, which delegated certain powers to a certain authority of their own creation under a rigid written Constitution. They are contiguous to one another, containing some sixty-three million people, with identical language; identical institutions, identical aims and identical currency; threatened by no strong neighboring powers; no part of the federation bound by obligations or treaties to which any other part objects, or is even likely to object; with absolute freedom internally and protection externally—a commercial policy, by the way, which seems to be the present idea of the whole New World Compact within themselves, and with continuous lines of railroad (about one hundred and seventy thousand miles in all) running the whole length and breadth of the federation, they form a colossal power, solid by reason of the diffused ownership of the land, the diversity of employment between agriculture and manufactures, the rapidity of intercommunication, and, although practically only a hundred years old—not older than individuals still living among us—they are already, in actual wealth, the richest community and the greatest manufacturing community in the world’s potentially fabulous in population and power, but with no standing army and a comparatively small navy. Yet they are strong for defense, because, having..." In no outlying dependencies and in the last resort being absolutely independent of external commerce owing to the complexity for supplying abundantly within their own borders every need of man, all they require is a navy strong enough for purely defensive purposes. Turn it in which way we will, however, we shall find that there is always one thing clear—namely, that by the inexorable logic of facts, Canada is essentially a New World industrial power. She is approaching very rapidly to the part of the ways, and one of the most interesting and far-reaching events of the year will the course she decides on as to commercial union with the United States; for it can scarcely be supposed that will permanently cut herself off from the grand market at her doors, and commercial union will almost inevitably bring her to a closer bond. No man can tell yet what her decision will be. All that can be certainly affirmed is that it will be one of the most momentous decisions in the history of the New World, been as if the Dominion and Newfoundland eventually determine to throw in their lots with the United States, the last material link between the Old World and the continent of the Western Hemisphere. There will be snapped, and the North American continent, under a single federation, will present to view the most solid power that the world has ever seen — purely industrial, armed only for defense, and with no bone of contention between itself and any other power, either of the Old or the New World. There was a time when to talk of United States absorbing Canada and becoming one great North. Ann i icau con tinent was ridiculed. The time is not far distent when the great union will take place, thereby making the United States the wonder of the entire world. SUPERIOR STABILITY ASSURER UNDER A BI-METALLIC MONETARY SYSTEM. Professor Sidgwick says, in respect to metallic money, that the claims of the State to the “monopoly of coining have been so generally admitted that the most uncompromising advocates of fainter faire have rarely thought it needful even to explain why they have questioned such a claim. It seems to us, however, that in this very fact is to be found a sufficing answer to the contention that the present coining value of gold is derived from and closely approximate to its “intrinsic, that is, its inherent value. For were that the fact, the disciples of fainter faire must logically, one and all, coincide with Mr. Herbert Spencer who has urged that the business of coining money should be left to private persons as all other fabrivals are. Assuredly, were 280 grains of gold nine-tenths fine intrinsically, or inherently, worth £3 17s. 9d., there certainly could be no reason for making a Government monopoly of the manufacture of gold money whether of dollars, sovereigns or 20-franc pieces. AwA tnronnn nf Mr Sidtrwifik.oertainlV one of the most authoritative of English writers on the subject of political economy, we may here notice that he distinctly declares: “A substantially bi-metallic currency; that is, currency in which both metals (gold and silver) are used to a considerable extent, must be taken to have advantages in respect to stability.” And the same writer, we find, goes on to say, as we asserted in this journal nearly ten years ago, that, practically, “the internal trade of the English Empire is actually carried on under bi-metallic conditions.” Professor Sidgwick likewise expresses the opinion that “the chances are that there will be somewhat less variation in the annual supply when two metals are used than when one alone is used.” * When both metals are coined into legal tender in unlimited amounts, a rate must be fixed at which they circuited together * * * Further for reasons explained—at length—he concludes that: “Indeed the most eager monometallists do not appear to desire the universal adoption of a gold currency at the risk of a great rise in the value of the medium of exchange.' Uncle Jerry Rusk may not be learned in all the intricacies of European diplomacy, but his blind American advocacy of retaliation by this Government undoubtedly had weight in convincing the German Government of the wisdom of withdrawing the embargo it had placed on cur meats. The farmer member of the administration seem to be holding his own right. Along. Still there are people who insist that the farmers are ignorant of the science of government, and the stalwart Republican correspondent of the R.N. Journal will get his foot in it if he plays the farmers to be ignorant of all else but farming. The President of the Tax Commission of New York City, hasn't a very high opinion of the honesty of the big business concerns of that city. He says, as matters are now, very few, except honest and ignorant persons, pay personal taxes. By various chancery subterfuges, wealthy men avoid the payment of these taxes, ninety-five percent escape, and we can't catch them. Many years practice have given C. A. Snow & Co., Solicitors of Patents at Washington, D.C., unsurpassed success in obtaining patents for all classes of invention. They make a specialty of rejected cases, and have secured allowance of many patents that had been previously rejected.

The convention of the Good Roads association at North Yakima is naturally an event to excite interest throughout the state, and the attendance of good sized delegations from the various sections is not surprising. The Commercial Club and business men of North Yakima are to be commended for their efforts to give all present a good view of one of the state's best and most fruitful districts. Every effort that is Made for the betterment of the roads of the north is worthy of the warmest and most enthusiastic encouragement, and it is a promising indication that general interest is taken in the subject. It is a matter in which the people of all parts of the northwest are vitally concerned, and the suggestions which are made and plans that are outlined will assuredly bear good results. Local energy and enterprise in different localities have accomplished much in the way of improving the highways, and with every step taken, the farmers and businessmen reap prompt and appreciable benefits. The Good Roads association, through its officers and those of its members who are giving the subject constant attention, is doing a work the effects of which will be manifest for years to come, and the more closely local communities keep in touch with what is being done by the central organization with state and federal assistance, the better will it be for themselves and for the state as a whole. — Spokesman. Destroy the Thistles. Attorney General Atkinson rendered the following opinion to G. W. Sutton, of Bickleton, Wash. "Your favor making inquiry as to the proper method in which to proceed against parties who refuse to cut down all the Canada thistles growing upon their land received, and in reply thereto personally we would say that it is the duty of the road supervisor, according to the provisions of section 3313, Pierce's code, to give notice to the owner of any land on which Canada or Russian thistles are growing to have same cut, and if such owner fails so to do within 10 days it is the supervisors' duty to enter upon such land and cause the same to be cut, sending the bill in to the owner of the land, and in his failure to pay same in 30 days, to present the said bill to the county commissioners, whose duty it is to pay same and to collect the same by levying an additional tax upon the land in question. "The act also provides that the owner of any land upon which Canada or Russian thistles are permitted to go seed shall be guilty of misdemeanor, and on conviction shall be liable to a fine of not to exceed $20. Criminal actions of this nature may be instituted by swearing out a complaint before some justice of the peace of the county in which the land is located, or by swearing out an information before the prosecuting attorney of said county. Justices of the peace have concurrent jurisdiction with the superior courts in such matters." Blacksmith Shop French is still at the old stand prepared to shoe any horse going. General and Impair Work Good quality in Good quality. A. B. FRENCH "Prosser Did It." Harry Vaughan was up from Richard yesterday, having the following to say about his defeat for re-election as assessor: "I attribute my defeat to the fact that I did my duty here in 1908 by raising the valuations of property, as required by law and as I was advised to do by the leading business men, the values also being listed throughout the county. I am not so certain of my friends and, in the future, when I can do any thing for the republican party in the county, will always be there with the goods I wanted to be elected, of course, but it is probably a good thing." For me that I was defeated, as I can make more money at something else." — Bulletin. Yes, Piosser did it. After all, factions there had profess undying friendship and unswerving loyalty to Mr. Van Horn, on election day they knifed him, running him over coffee behind his ticket. That's the kind of Indians they are. "The thing for Kennewick and the east ends to do now is to be re publicans," says the Bulletin. A study of the figures of the official count in another column will show that Kennewick was "fairly" re publican. This precinct gave practically the party vote or better to every nominee on the ticket. This of the other east end precincts. We gave a line vote to Marsh but Rattlesnake did not return the favor but cut and slashed every man on the ticket. Yet we are satisfied. We won nine out of a possible thirteen places. The east end was a unit on Tiavis and he was elected in spite of a solid west end opposition. This was the test vote and we WON. It was never the intention of the east end to make the vote a test for lighting strength on county seat removal, but since the Press press he came so nervous about the matter, east enders have given the matter some attention, and they are not surprised to find by the recent vote that this part of the county has votes enough to defeat Prosser. It is a matter of general comment since election that the east end holds the power, and in united action can outvote the county seat at the present time. They also point to the fact that this end of the county is receiving from three to five new settlers to every one that goes into the west end of the county. Interesting developments may take place inside of the next two or four years, so Prosser may as well continue to be scared. A united east end may make things interesting for the county seat, since the Prosser people have been so insistent in challenging the east end to a test vote. One fact is assured—this part of Benton County will not permit Prosser to forget that it begged for a test vote on the removal of the county courthouse from Prosser to Kennewick. —Sunshine.

(RE), Information Extraction (IE), biodiversity research, gold standard New information In this paper, we present two gold-standard corpora for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
and Relation Extraction (RE) generated from biodiversity datasets metadata and abstracts
that  can  be  used  as  evaluation  benchmarks  for  the  development  of  new  computer-
supported tools that require machine learning or deep learning techniques. These corpora
are manually labelled and verified by biodiversity experts. In addition, we explain the
detailed steps of constructing these datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate the underlying
ontology for the classes and relations used to annotate such corpora. Background Biodiversity is the assortment of life on earth covering evolutionary, ecological, biological,
and social forms. To preserve life in all its variety and richness, it is imperative to monitor
the current state of biodiversity and its change over time and to understand the forces
driving it. This need has resulted in numerous works being published in this field. With this,
a large amount of textual data (publications) and metadata (e.g. dataset description) has
been generated. To support the management and analysis of these data, two techniques
from computer science are of interest, namely Named Entity Recognition (NER) and
Relation  Extraction  (RE). While  the  former  enables  better  content  discovery  and
understanding, the latter fosters the analysis by detecting connections between entities
and, thus, allows us to draw conclusions and answer relevant domain-specific questions. To automatically predict entities and their relations, machine/deep learning techniques
could be used. The training and evaluation of those techniques require labelled corpora. Abdelmageed N et al Abdelmageed N et al 2 2.
Github Repo for the scripts: https://github.com/fusion-jena/BiodivNERE 2. Github Repo for the scripts: https://github.com/fusion-jena/BiodivNERE Background Biodiversity research is a sub-research domain of the Life Sciences that comprehends the
totality and variability of organisms, their morphology and genetics, life history and habitats
and geographical ranges (Shanmughavel 2007). Scientific data generated in biodiversity
research are very heterogenous and can occur in multiple formats. This is an obstacle for
machine processing, which needs additional information for data integration, data search
or data visualisation. Therefore, primary research data are described by metadata and
descriptive information along the W-questions (what, who, when, where and why). Such
metadata are mostly provided in structured formats, such as JSON or XML. Natural Language Processing (NLP), with its sub-task Information Extraction, is a research
field that uses these structured data or scientific publications. The aim is to develop
systems that automatically identify important terms and phrases in the text. That supports
scholars in obtaining a quick overview of unknown texts, for example, in search or allows
improved filtering. In the Life Sciences, Information Extraction has a long history (Thessen
et  al. 2012). Driven  by  a  series  of  workshops  and  shared  tasks,  such  as  BioNLP, 
BioCreative and BioASQ in the scope of CLEF, multiple corpora and tools for various
purposes were developed to extract main entities from text and relations amongst them
automatically. However, determining what a relevant entity or relation in a document or
data depends on the domain of focus. While scholars looking for biomedical data are
mainly interested in data types, such as diseases, biological processes and organisms (
Roberts et al. 2017) and related entities, such as genes and proteins, in biodiversity
research, other categories are of relevance, namely: organisms, environmental terms,
geographic  locations,  measured  data  parameters,  materials,  biological,  physical  and
chemical processes and data types (Löffler et al. 2021). BiodivNERE: Gold standard corpora for named entity recognition and relation ... BiodivNERE: Gold standard corpora for named entity recognition and relation ... 3 Our contribution is threefold: Our contribution is threefold: •

Github Repo for the scripts: https://github.com/fusion-jena/BiodivNERE 1. The data DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6575865 Introduction The increasing amount of scientific datasets in public data repositories calls for more
intelligent systems that automatically analyse, process, integrate, connect or visualise data. An essential building block in the evolution of such computer-supported analysis tools is
Information Extraction with its sub-tasks, Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation
Extraction (RE). That process aims to automatically identify important terms (entities) and
groups of terms/expressions, which can fall into a certain category in the data (NER), as
well as relationships between these entities (RE). However, the advancement of such tools
is applicable if gold standards, manually labelled test corpora, are available. This supports
the training of machines (for machine-learning approaches) and allows an evaluation of the
developed tool. For applied domains, such as biodiversity research, gold standards are
very rare. In this work, we present a novel gold standard for biodiversity research. We provide a NER
corpus,  based  on  scientific  metadata  files  and  abstracts  with  manual  annotations  of
important terms, such as species (ORGANISM), environmental terms (ENVIRONMENT),
data parameters and variables measured (QUALITY), geographic locations (LOCATION),
biological, chemical and physical processes (PHENOMENA) and materials (MATTER), for
example, chemical compounds. In addition, we provide an RE corpus, based on a portion
of the same data that consists of important binary and multi-class relationships amongst
entities, such as OCCUR_IN (Organism, Environment), INFLUENCE (Organism, Process)
and  HAVE/OF  (Quality,  Environment). We  also  added  these  identified  entities  and
relationships to a conceptual model developed in our previous work (Abdelmageed et al. 2021a). 1.
The data DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6575865 1. The data DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6575865 Biodiversity Questions The biodiversity question corpus consists of 169 questions provided by around 70 scholars
of three biodiversity research-related projects (Löffler et al. 2021). Concerning the topics
and granularity, the questions are very diverse and reflect different information needs. While some questions ask for facts, such as "What butterfly species occur on calcareous
grassland?", others are more complex and aim to obtain an answer on associations, for
example, How do autotrophic microorganisms influence carbon cycling in groundwater
aquifers? The noun entities of these questions were manually labelled (including nested
entities, such as adjectives, for example, autotrophic microorganisms). Nine biodiversity
scholars grouped the labelled nouns and phrases into 13 proposed categories. Each
annotator classified all 169 questions, which resulted in 592 total annotations. It turned out
that seven categories (entity types) were mentioned very often (at least 89 times per
category):  ORGANISM  (e.g. plants,  fungi,  bacteria),  ENVIRONMENT  (environments
species live in), QUALITY (characteristics to be measured), MATERIAL (e.g. chemical
compounds),  PROCESS  (re-occurring  biological  and  physical  processes),  LOCATION
(geographic location) and DATA TYPE (research results, e.g. lidar data). All annotations for
which the inter-rater agreement was larger than 0.6 (representing a substantial agreement
(Landis and Koch 1977)) were exported to a final XML file. The  identified  relevant  entity  types  from  this  question  corpus  were  aligned  with  the
detected categories of classes from BiodivOnto in several discussion rounds. The final
outcome (see Table 1) was used to inspect the annotated questions again. This inspection
consists of manually detecting the relations between the already annotated entities in each
question. We omitted questions that do not possess any annotation of the final classes or
provide only one class. We only considered questions that contain at least two annotations
of the entity types in Table 1. In total, 91 questions were utilised for the relation detection in
the question corpus. The main idea for the relation detection process was to come up with categorisation for
relations similar to the categories for noun entities. The detection process was conducted
in several rounds. In the first pilot phase, three scholars analysed only a few questions
about  the  existence  of  relations. The  initial  instruction  was  to  manually  inspect  the
questions and to identify binary relations between the occurring entities. Scholars were
also advised to inspect the given verbs (which mainly describe a relation) and to think
about suitable categories for the relations. Previous Resources Analysis In the first step, we had to figure out which categories (or entity types) are relevant for
biodiversity research. In addition, we also had to explore occurring relations amongst these Abdelmageed N et al 4 entities. Therefore, we selected two sources from our previous works: 1) BiodivOnto
(Abdelmageed et al. 2021b) and a biodiversity research-related question corpus (Löffler et
al. 2021). In this section, we describe how we decided on the classes and relations to be
used  in  the  annotation  process. We  also  elaborate  on  how  we  came  along  with  a
reconciled model representing the final conceptual model we used in this work. In addition,
we introduce the underlying data sources for the development of the novel gold standards. Biodiversity Questions In a second round, the proposed relation
categories were discussed. The outcome was used for the final detection round. The final
agreed relation categories are: BiodivNERE: Gold standard corpora for named entity recognition and relation ... 5 Tag

ENVIRONMENT Data Sources To construct our corpora, we re-used our previous work's collected metadata and abstracts
(Abdelmageed et al. 2021b). Thus, metadata files are gathered from two data sources with
very different characteristics (BEFChina and data.world). The Semedico search engine
(Faessler and Hahn 2017) retrieves relevant abstracts from PubMed, a source with more
than 32M abstracts. To ensure the relevance of the crawled data from Semedico, we have
followed an iterative way of revision. We started with the initial keywords set that we used
to  crawl. Then,  we  manually  revised  it  to  guarantee  relevance. More  details  on  the
collection  and  crawling,  license  verification,  and  biodiversity  relevance  checking  are
already explained in (Abdelmageed et al. 2021b) and go beyond the scope of this paper. Initially, these collected data were meant to extract biodiversity-related keywords. However,
in this work, we use them for the purpose of developing NER and RE corpora. BiodivOnto However, we do not include them in the new ontology version since the most common
relations in the Biodiversity Questions lack them. We picked on the relations that appear in
both sources only. Fig. 2 illustrates the reconciled version of BiodivOnto, based on the old BiodivOnto model
and the Biodiversity Questions. It consists of six classes and 17 relations we used in the
annotation process. Figure 2. Updated version of BiodivOnto. Dashed lines are relations from the original BiodivOnto, while

solid lines are the new ones, based on the Biodiversity questions. BiodivOnto BiodivOnto is a conceptual model of the core concepts and relations in the biodiversity
domain. The first version of BiodivOnto (Abdelmageed et al. 2021b) was developed in
2021, whereas the most recent ontology version is given by (Abdelmageed et al. 2021a). Such core or general concepts represent the classes of annotation utilised. The proposed
class names were discussed with two biodiversity experts who are also authors of this
paper. We finally agreed on, for example, ORGANISM, PHENOMENA and MATTER as Abdelmageed N et al 6 6 tags  for  the  NER  corpus. However,  BiodivOnto  contains  subclasses  as  well,  like
Ecosystem and Landscape, which are subclasses of the Environment class. To facilitate
the annotation process, we decided to use the top-level classes only. In this case, both
Ecosystem  and  Landscape  are  substituted  by  the  ENVIRONMENT  class. The  same
applies to Trait and Quality, where only QUALITY was used as an annotating class. LOCATION has appeared as a common concept in the Biodiversity Questions (see above);
we included it as well as a core concept in the BiodivOnto. Table 1 summarises the final
selected classes of interest that were used in the NER annotation. Figure 1. Occurrence frequency of relations in questions related to biodiversity research. BiodivOnto initially had the following relations: •

(Butchart et al. 2010, Cardinale et al. 2012). Research in this domain has recently seen
accelerated growth, leading to the big data scenario of the biodiversity literature. For Abdelmageed N et al 8 instance, the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) currently holds over 55 million digitised
pages of legacy biology text from the 15 -21  centuries, representing a huge amount of
textual content (Nguyen et al. 2019). Extracting core knowledge, i.e. entities and relations
between these entities, from myriads of available resources, allows a better overview of the
data and thus supports fact discovery. In this section, we outline the state-of-the-art related
work towards building such gold standards in the Life Sciences, focusing on biodiversity
research. th
st Named Entity Recognition (NER) Corpora BiodivNERE: Gold standard corpora for named entity recognition and relation ... 9 9 The existing datasets have several limitations. They focus on species only, like the case of
BioFid and COPIOUS. They are based on legacy data, as in COPIOUS and BioFID. They
rely on only Pubmed abstracts like the case of Species800 and Linnaeus. They miss one
important concept in the field, like the case of QEMP; it does not contain species. In this
work, we create an NER corpus that contains various biodiversity classes for abstracts and
metadata files. The existing datasets have several limitations. They focus on species only, like the case of
BioFid and COPIOUS. They are based on legacy data, as in COPIOUS and BioFID. They
rely on only Pubmed abstracts like the case of Species800 and Linnaeus. They miss one
important concept in the field, like the case of QEMP; it does not contain species. In this
work, we create an NER corpus that contains various biodiversity classes for abstracts and
metadata files. Relation Extraction (RE) Corpora Identifying the important entities is the first step in creating an RE gold standard. Based on
this information, relationships amongst the entities in a sentence can be determined in a
second step. There is a variety of approaches in the biomedical domain to identify relations
amongst genes, diseases, proteins and drugs BioInfer (Pyysalo et al. 2007), BioRelEx
(Khachatrian et al. 2019), EU-ADR  ( van  Mulligen  et  al. 2012)  and  its  successor  GAD
(Bravo et al. 2015). All of them use biomedical abstracts or full articles from PubMed as
data sources. In contrast, some approaches do not identify the exact mention of relation
but only determine the existence of a binary relation between entities (van Mulligen et al. 2012,  Bravo  et  al. 2015,  Khachatrian  et  al. 2019). Other  gold  standards  distinguish
between four main relation types, such as "causal", "is_a", "part_of" and "observation"
(Pyysalo et al. 2007). They also developed a large ontology to describe the entities and
their relations semantically. There  are  only  two  approaches  for  relation  extraction  in  the  biodiversity  domain:
BacteriaBiotop (Delėger et al. 2016) and COPIOUS (Nguyen et al. 2019). The former
defines a binary "lives_in" relation between Taxons and Habitats. The latter uses a pattern-
based  system  that  can  identify  any  binary  relations  between  entities  within  a  single
sentence  to  detect  four  relations:  Taxon  "occur"  Habitat,  Taxon  "occur"  Temporal
Expression, Taxon "occur" Geographic Location and Taxon "seen by" Person. To the best of our knowledge, there is no gold standard with relations also from dataset
metadata. The introduced corpora only have the main focus on species, habitats and
locations. However, biodiversity research is a diverse research field with other important
categories, such as data parameters, processes, materials and data types (Löffler et al. 2021). Therefore, we aim to develop a gold standard that supports both multiple and binary
relations and goes beyond the annotation of species, habitats, and geographic locations. General description Purpose: This project aims at constructing two corpora for NER and RE tasks, based on
abstracts and metadata files from Biodiversity datasets. Named Entity Recognition (NER) Corpora BIOfid (Ahmed et al. 2019) is a Specialised Information Service for Biodiversity Research
launched to mobilise valuable biological data from printed literature hidden in German
libraries for the past 250 years. First, historical literature was converted into text using OCR
and plants, birds and butterfly occurrences were annotated. A training dataset was then
generated for named entity recognition and taxa recognition from biological documents. After that, this training dataset was used to create a global standard for taxa recognition in
the German biodiversity literature. Even though BIOfid represents a global standard, it is a
limited  resource  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  input  resources  are  limited  to  German
literature only, (ii) the entity identification process focuses only on taxa and other more
generic categories, such as person and location. COPIOUS (Nguyen et al. 2019) is another gold standard corpus covering a wide range of
biodiversity entities. The corpus has 668 documents downloaded from the Biodiversity
Heritage Library with over 26K sentences and more than 28K entities. Only two annotators
manually  annotated  the  corpus  with  five  categories  of  entities,  i.e. taxon  names,
geographical locations, habitats, temporal expressions and person names. The proposed
gold  standard  supported  the  development  of  named  entity  recognition  and  relation
extraction using two different machine-learning techniques. Species-800 (Pafilis et al. 2013) is based on 800 PubMed abstracts, such as 100 abstracts
from journals in eight categories: bacteriology, botany, entomology, medicine, mycology,
protistology,  virology,  and  zoology. Similar  to  (Nguyen  et  al. 2019),  Species-800  is
annotated with taxon entities and normalised to the NCBI Taxonomy database. Linnaeus (Gerner et al. 2010) is a 100 full-text documents from the PubMed Central Open
Access (PMC OA) document set randomly selected and annotated for species mentions. The corpus was only annotated for species (except for the cases where genus names were
incorrectly  used  when  referring  to  species). Same  as  the  case  with  COPIOUS  and
Species-800, all mentions of species terms were manually annotated and normalised to
the NCBI taxonomy IDs of the intended species, except for terms where the author did not
refer to the species. QEMP (Löffler et al. 2020) is the only corpus that is based on biodiversity metadata files. It
provides  annotations  for  four  main  categories:  Organism,  Material  for  chemical
compounds, Process for chemical, biological and natural processes, Environment that
represents the habitat of organisms, Quality for data measures and Location. Additional information:  Methodology In this section, we describe the process of constructing the NER and RE corpora. BiodivNER Construction Pipeline BiodivNER Construction Pipeline Abdelmageed N et al 10 In this section, we explain the construction pipeline of the NER corpus as shown in Fig. 3. Our process consists of seven steps. It starts with the annotation guidelines to describe
what we annotate and is followed by the data preparation step in which the originally
collected data is transformed into the required data format used for annotation. In the pilot
phase, we carry out an initial annotation task to check whether we have to modify the
annotation guidelines or whether we have to invest more time in the annotators' training. Afterwards, the actual annotation task takes place. The outcome is evaluated with the
computation  of  the  inter-rater  agreement. Finally,  we  discuss  the  mismatches  with
biodiversity experts in the reconciliation phase. Figure 3. Our proposed NER corpus construction pipeline following (Pustejovsky and Stubbs 2012). Our proposed NER corpus construction pipeline following (Pustejovsky and Stubbs 2012). •
Annotation Guidelines We followed a modified version of our previous project guidelines to construct the QEMP
corpus (Löffler et al. 2020). We set the current sentence as the only available context to
annotate. We did not consider the entire document as in the gold standard construction
process in NLP. Since the main purpose of this work is to develop a corpus for NER, we
consider only noun entities and discard adjective entities. In addition, we gave higher
attention to the complex words and minimised the chance of having two valid annotations
for one term. Thus, we followed the longest span annotation and avoided nested entities
annotation. For example, "benthic oxygen uptake rate" is annotated as [QUALITY], while
we ignored any simple word annotation inside such span. Conjunctions are handled as two
separate  entities. For  example,  "(phylogenetic  diversity)[QUALITY]  of  (bacteria)
[ORGANISM]". We included more existing external resources than the ones used in QEMP
to find proper annotations. For example, we considered the following ontologies that were
used  for  constructing  the  original  version  of  BiodivOnto:  ECSO and  ECOCORE for
environmental-related terms, BCO and CBO for phenomena-related keywords. In addition, BiodivNERE: Gold standard corpora for named entity recognition and relation ... 11 we utilise NCBITaxon and FLOPO for species and phenotype annotation, respectively. Moreover, we used the SWEET ontology to capture any missing terms from the previous
ontologies. Our last option to find annotations from existing sources is a reference to the
ontological issues detected and summarised by (Löffler et al. 2020). Such a mixture of
selected resources facilitated the detection of a wide range of terms that vary in their
granularity (too specific vs. too general terms). •
Data Preparation We parsed the original data collection into sentences. For each sentence, we tokenised it
into a set of words using ntlk library. Since our used annotation format is BIO-scheme,
where a word is annotated either with B-tag as a beginning of an entity or, I-tag as an
inside of entity or, O as outside of the entity, each word is initialised with an O tag. Each
sentence as a set of words with O tags is stored vertically in a CSV file, as shown in Fig. 4
a. Afterwards, we split the entire corpus into two halves to enable the double annotation
process. Figure 4. NER annotation process a initially prepared data; b while annotating data. NER annotation process a initially prepared data; b while annotating data. NER annotation process a initially prepared data; b while annotating data. •
Pilot Phase and Participant Guidance •
Pilot Phase and Participant Guidance Four authors of this paper were responsible for annotating the corpus. Two authors have
previous  experience  with  biodiversity  text  annotation. The  four  annotators  received
periodical guidance from two biodiversity experts. Initially, we established a trial or a pilot
phase before the actual annotation process took place. The purpose of this phase is to
ensure  the  training  of  the  annotators  (participant  guidance)  as  well  as  to  revise  the
annotation guidelines. Around 2% (450 sentences) of the entire corpus is assigned to each
annotator pair. Each annotator labelled a local copy of the pilot phase data in an Excel file. During this process, each annotator was asked to annotate a relevant term with one and
only one tag from the provided tags. The results of this process are represented in Fig. 4b. After the end of the Pilot Phase, we held a "Share Thoughts" meeting to discuss the Abdelmageed N et al 12 outcome. At this stage, we realised that we need a modified version of the guidelines. For
example, at the beginning, not all annotators followed the 'longest span' rule and annotated
every single word separately. Thus, we have settled on the longest span sequence to avoid
or  minimise  such  inconsistencies. In  addition,  we  have  decided  to  add  the  SWEET
ontology to include missing terms from the other used ontologies. •
Reconciliation We  have  extracted  the  mismatches  in  a  separate  sheet  per  annotator  pair. A  sheet
contained the actual sentence with each of the annotator's answers. The task of each
annotator pair was to reconcile their mismatches and to reach a final annotation that the
two agreed on. We noticed that a significant cause for the mismatches was the rule of
longest text span consideration in the annotation guidelines. For example, one annotator
labelled the entire phrase "Secondary Metabolites" as MATERIAL, while the other tagged
only "Metabolites" as MATERIAL. Such cases were the easiest to solve. However, other
cases, where an annotator pair could not agree on one correct annotation were discussed
with the biodiversity experts. For example, "Soil lipid biomass" seemed to be confusing as
it could be either classified as MATTER or QUALITY. In such a case, we followed the
biodiversity expert's opinion and settled on MATTER. BiodivNERE: Gold standard corpora for named entity recognition and relation ... BiodivNERE: Gold standard corpora for named entity recognition and relation ... 13 BiodivRE construction Pipeline In this section, we describe our pipeline of constructing the binary and multi-class RE
corpus on top of the BiodivNER. Initially, we transformed the annotated data for NER to
suit the RE annotations process. Then, we tried to sample a subset of sentences to obtain
a reasonable size of the RE corpus to be annotated. For each sampling method, we
detailed  its  advantages  and  disadvantages. Afterwards,  we  explained  the  annotation
process for the RE corpus. Figure 6. Team B Agreement Scores. Figure 6. Team B Agreement Scores. •
Annotation Process and Agreement •
Annotation Process and Agreement After  the  pilot  phase,  we  familiarised  ourselves  with  the  annotation  process  and  the
guidelines. Each half of the corpus was assigned to an annotator pair. We followed the
same procedure as in the pilot phase. Each annotator from the annotators' pair worked
blindly on a local copy of the sheet. We refer to blindly as without access to the annotation
of the other colleague. This procedure ensures the higher quality of annotated data and
allows the calculation of the inter-rater agreement. Each annotator was asked to complete
the annotation of half of the corpus. This annotation process was time-consuming and
lasted for several months. Annotating a term is considered to be done if the annotator
found the target tag in the selected existing data sources. However, if the annotator was
unsure about the correct annotation, the term with a suggested tag was kept in a separate
sheet named "Open Issues". We held various meetings with the biodiversity experts during
this stage to solve the open issues. Since we had two annotator pairs, let's say, team A and
B for two different sheets, where each sheet represented half of the corpus, we were able
to calculate the inter-rater agreement for each team. We used Kappa's score for the
agreement computation since it is one of the most common statistics to test inter-rater
reliability (Berry and Mielke 2016). The scores are 0.76 and 0.70 for teams A and B,
respectively, with an average score of 0.73. In addition, we calculated both precision, recall
and F1-score for both teams, as shown in Figs 5, 6. Team A reached an average precision,
recall and F1-score of 0.73, 0.65 and 0.67 respectively. However, Team B gained average
scores: 0.66, 0.74 and 0.67 for both precision, recall and F1-score respectively. Figure 5. Team A Agreement Scores Figure 5. Team A Agreement Scores Team A Agreement Scores Team A Agreement Scores •
Random Sampling In the pilot phase of BiodivRE construction, we used a random sampling mechanism
amongst  the  created  corpus. We  did  not  consider  any  selection  criteria. We  directly
stacked the entire corpus in a list, shuffled it and randomly picked "n" sentences. We
started annotating the resultant smaller corpus and, by doing so, we encountered two
issues. At first, we found long sentences with too far tags, i.e. have many words between
them, which makes the existence of a relation between the two tags impossible. Second,
some of the relation pairs in the ontology have not appeared in the corpus at all. There are
two reasons for the second issue. Either such kinds of relations do not appear in the
original corpus or they are missed by the sampler since it depends purely on the random
selection. The conclusion from the pilot phase is the need for changing the sampling
strategy. •
Initial Construction We considered the final NER corpus as an input for the RE corpus construction. We
prepared the data in such a way to be more readable. Each sentence is represented by Abdelmageed N et al 14 one row, followed by its corresponding NER annotations in the following line. The NER
corpus contains sentences with multiple tags. However, an RE corpus should be designed
in  a  way  that  each  sentence  contains  exactly  two  tags. We  generated  all  possible
combinations for sentences with more than two tags, including exactly two tags. Fig. 7
illustrates an example where one sentence with three tags generates three sentences with
two labels. This operation generated a large-scale corpus with more than 52K sentences. We  expect  a  high  rate  of  FALSE  (no  relation)  statements  in  the  generated  corpus. However, our task aims at creating an RE corpus with a good balance between TRUE
(existing relation) and FALSE sentences. To achieve this, we have to choose a suitable
sampling strategy to achieve the best balance amongst the selected sentences. Therefore,
we have explored two different sampling methods. We discuss them in the following
sections. Figure 7. Creating sentence variations from a sentence containing more than two tags. Figure 7. Creating sentence variations from a sentence containing more than two tags. •
Annotation Process We directly referred to BiodivOnto and limited the accepted relations to those supported by
the ontology. On the one hand, for each sentence, we checked whether there is a relation
between its two named entities. On the other hand, whether this relation has a semantic
correspondence in the BiodivOnto. For example, a verb relation "has an impact on" is
considered a synonym for the ontological relation "influence". FALSE examples would be
either the relation is not supported by the BiodivOnto or it has a different meaning than the
ontological relation. For example, "Climate change (B-Phenomena I-Phenomena) impacts
the carbon dioxide (B-Matter I-Matter)" is a FALSE sentence since there is no ontological
relation between PHENOMENA-MATTER. Such a sentence would appear since we also
choose from the "Other" group in the selected sampling method. Another FALSE example
might occur between two entities with a relation in the BiodivOnto. "Trees (B-Organism)
with extrafloral nectaries (B-Matter I-Matter)" is a FALSE statement since the word with
does not imply the relation influence between ORGANISM and MATTER. Similar to our procedure to construct the NER corpus, we also applied a pilot phase for RE
annotation. Two of the authors annotated the same 50 sentences that were randomly
picked. Afterwards,  we  calculated  the  inter-rater  agreement  (Kappa's  score),  which
resulted in 0.94. Due to this high score, we decided to split the corpus and individually
continue the annotation. During  the  real  annotation  phase,  we  encountered  issues  regarding  the  entity  tags,
especially for the longest span annotation. This rule does not seem to be correctly followed
during  the  annotation  of  the  NER  corpus. For  example,  "earthworm  invasion"  was
annotated as "B-Organism" "B-Phenomena", instead of "B-Phenomena" "I-Phenomena". For those cases, we fixed them to follow the rule of the annotation declared originally in the
NER guidelines. Fig. 8 shows samples from an annotation sheet. The first column holds
the actual relation label from BiodivOnto that will be used for the multi-class RE corpus. Then, it is followed by a binary relation tag (0- no relation, 1- existing relation). Yellow cells
highlight the relation between the two entities of interest in the text. Red cell indicates that
there is a relation based on the sentence, but not supported by  BiodivOnto. In this
sentence, the verb "degrade" has an "influence" meaning implicitly. However, we expect to
have a relationship that semantically means "have"; thus, the sentence is tagged with a
"0". •
Balance-Biased Sampling We developed a Balance-Biased sampler to have more control over what to include in the
final RE corpus. It is inspired by the Round-robin scheduler. We grouped the sentences
from the initial construction by tag-pair, where a valid pair is the one appearing in the
BiodivOnto  and  the  unsupported  co-occurrences  were  grouped  into  a  new  category,
"Other". At this stage, we handled the relations bidirectionally between entities of interest to
cover  cases  like  ENVIRONMENT  have  QUALITY  and  QUALITY  of  ENVIRONMENT. Afterwards, we iterated over the groups, including the entire set of tag-pairs, as well as the
"Other" group. We picked one sentence from each group until a threshold was reached. By
this means, we avoided any bias that could be caused by a random sampler. In our case, BiodivNERE: Gold standard corpora for named entity recognition and relation ... 15 we selected 4000 sentences as a threshold. An additional criterion is that we limit the
number of words between the two entities of interest to a certain value, for example, 30
words. In this way, we solved the two problems that appeared using the random sampling
method. At first, we guarantee that we cover all the relations of the BiodivOnto, if it exists in
the text, in the final corpus. Second, we avoid cases with FALSE sentences due to too far
entities, since it is clear that no relation could exist between them. •

the actual sentence with two anonymised entities that are supposed to have (have not) a relation. BiodivNER Characteristics QEMP  has  four
categories  derived  from  the  biodiversity  domain  (Environment,  Material,  Process  and
Quality). As there is already a variety of corpora for species, we only concentrated on
missing categories in QEMP. BiodivNER also covers such an essential category in addition
to the same closely-related classes as QEMP and a general domain LOCATION category. COPIOUS has two categories closely related to biodiversity (Habitat and Taxon) and two
general  Categories  (TemporalExpression  and  GeographicalLocation). QEMP  has  four
categories  derived  from  the  biodiversity  domain  (Environment,  Material,  Process  and
Quality). As there is already a variety of corpora for species, we only concentrated on
missing categories in QEMP. BiodivNER also covers such an essential category in addition
to the same closely-related classes as QEMP and a general domain LOCATION category. BiodivNER Characteristics The final version of the NER corpus consists of three folds: train, dev and test because our
corpus mainly addresses various tasks in NLP that could be solved, based on machine-
learning techniques. We followed the split of 80%, 10% and 10% for the train, dev and test
sets, respectively. All files are given in a CSV format, each of which consists of three
entries Sentence#, Word and Tag, as shown in Fig. 4b. Fig. 9 provides an overview of the
category  distribution  inside  the  BiodivNER  corpus  in  the  tree  data  folds. QUALITY
represents  the  most  occurring  mention  in  the  corpus,  followed  by  ORGANISM  and
ENVIRONMENT, respectively. However, LOCATION is the least frequent one. The overall
distribution reflects a diverse corpus of the most important classes in the biodiversity
domain. Moreover, we compare our BiodivNER to the existing common corpora. Table 2 shows the
comparison overview. We compared in terms of the used data source, collected data type,
number of annotated documents, number of statements, words, categories and mentions. Mentions represent how many words are annotated. We also provide the number of unique
mentions. COPIOUS corpus is the largest in terms of all aspects, except the number of
categories. However, BiodivNER covers the greatest number of categories. In addition,
BiodivNER is the largest corpus that is based on metadata files of biodiversity datasets as
a data source. Figure 9. Category distribution of BiodivNER corpus. 18

the frequencies in a bidirectional order. For example, ORG-ENV represents the total of
such a pair and ENV-ORG as well. Since QUALITY is the most frequent class in the NER
corpus, this is also reflected in the category pairs ORG-QUA and ENV-QUA. The self-
relations that appear in ENV-ENV and PHE-PHE are the least frequent in our corpus. Other category pairs that the BiodivOnto support do not appear in the text used for creating
the RE corpus. For example, ORG-ORG and ORG-LOC. The "Other" group represents any
co-occurrences that appear in the text and do not exist in the BiodivOnto. In addition, Figs
11, 12 depict the binary and multi-class annotation distribution of the BiodivRE in the three
folds of the benchmark. Such that "have" followed by "occur_in" are the most common
relations in the corpus. Fig. 10 shows the category pairs distribution of the BiodivRE corpus. We have calculated

scope of the annotation is limited to only one sentence, as was the case of our BiodivRE
corpus. For example, the COPIOUS corpus discusses the RE part, but the data are
unavailable. BiodivRE Characteristics Similar to BiodivNER, we created three folds in a CSV format for both binary and multi-
class RE corpus. The files consist of two columns: (1) the relationship either in a binary or
label form and (2) the sentence where the actual named entities are encoded with their
tags. An example line in the file of binary relations: "1 Our study shows a significant decline
of the @QUALITY$ of @ENVIRONMENT$.". However, it would be in the multi-relations
files  as:  "have,  Our  study  shows  a  significant  decline  of  the  @QUALITY$  of BiodivNERE: Gold standard corpora for named entity recognition and relation ... 19 @ENVIRONMENT$." This format will facilitate the training procedure for any machine-
learning technique. We followed the same split setting for 80%, 10%, 10% of the train, dev
and test sets, respectively. @ENVIRONMENT$." This format will facilitate the training procedure for any machine-

context of annotation and, thus, we skip it here. For BioRelEx, in the original dataset paper,
they have -1, 1 and 0 classes. We use them here as the former two classes map to TRUE,
while  the  latter  maps  to  FALSE  classes. BiodivRE  has  a  second-place  amongst  the
existing corpora concerning the number of sentences (4K) with a higher rate of FALSE
sentences. There are two reasons behind this high number of FALSE statements. On the
one hand, we found that most metadata sentences have a listing format of entities and we
could not guess the relation amongst them (the most frequent sentences). On the other
hand, BiodivOnto is still incomplete; some relations are missing from it. For example, Abdelmageed N et al 20 "Trees  (B-ORGANISM)  with  extrafloral  nectaries  (B_MATTER,  I-MATTER)"  holds  a
meaning of contains, but we look for influence. Figure 10. Category pairs distribution. For display purposes, category names are abbreviated to three

from  the biodiversity  domain. For  example,  we  restore  the  dropped  relations  from
BiodivOnto, for example, "part_of" and "is_a". In addition, we include more data sources to Abdelmageed N et al 22 cover a broader range of the domain. Moreover, we evaluate them in terms of the quality of

Senator O'Gonnan of New York, the toastmaster, had at his right "!' ; Speaker Champ Clark, one of Mls- ''M ,irl'c nsiilrantc for tho presidential - nomination. To the right of Mr ' V Clark was Alton 13. Parker of New $ ' York, defeated candidate for the Dc ", I mocracy in 1904. Beside Mr. Parker -..? lJ sat Senator Kern of Indiana, former iA 1 candldato for vice president, who ap - 4 peared as tho champion of Governor ' Thomas R.

Between rail' Mr. Bryan and Governor Woodrow t Wilson of New Jersey, "who also seeks ', tho presidential nomination, sat Sen S j, ator Newlands of Nevada. At Gov a T ernor Wilson's left was Joseph W. fJj .'.. Folk of Missouri, who received the i$f : ' endorsement of his state convention - ' ; In 1910 for presidential honors. Next $ : was Senator Pomerene of Ohio, who ;j ; appeared as the representative of K '. Governor Harmon. $J -J Mr Bryan's cntranco was signalled $. by loud cheers. n r Mr Bryan and Speaker Clark ex- 4 changed cordial greetings but it was notlceablo that the Nebraskan was U anxious to confer with Governor Wil- mm& son, whom ho joined after a short ; 1 talk with the speaker. Ml Former Governor Folk was the last P of 'the presidential possibilities to m enter the banquet hall, and although 1- ho passed Speaker Clark's chair, there Ij was no sign of recognition from ei- PM 1,ier Missourian. fB WASHINGTON, Jan. S. Speaker ,A 4 Champ Clark's speech at the Jack Jj son Day dinner here tonight was an M X appeal to all those who are opposed a to "standpatteis" and to "standpat" J i policies to "stand together, pull to ll ; gethev and work-together." Tne l - only hope of the country for pro 5 ; gressho legislation, he declaied, lies ,3 ' in the Democratic party because tho g -"standpatters" are in the majority m ' among the Republicans Referring to fl ' ' the split of the Republican party, the 3 i ! speaker said it looked as though, noth fls -: lng short of a miracle could bring 1 ! ' the warring factions together, but at & I the same time he warned against de 28 ; pending for succoss upon opppnents' 2 dissensions. M "Democrats desire progressive leg- ji . ilation," said Mr. Clark- "Indepen- M dents and divers Republicans want it. jf I The majority of tho American people a favor it. The only way to achieve it 'S ! is at the hands of Democrats. The (M ! Insurgent Republicans would, no doubt, enact some remedial legisla- .1 tlon if they could, but the Standpat- J ' tors are in the majority in that par- V ' ty and it looks as though they will 1 ' continue to dominate it indefinitely. , J ' It may bo for years and it may be forever.

As the Insur gent Republicans can achieve nothing except when working In conjunction with Dcmocrnts they would mont easi ly and moat certainly accomplish their purpose by voting for Democrats all along the line. Wo are politically somewhat In the same condition which wleo old Ben Franklin described him self and his compntrlola to be in when, after signing the Declaration of Independence, he exclaimed: "Now, we must all hang together or wo will all hang separately.' "One thing Is elenr as crystal'' con tinued the speaker "In order to win wo must hold all the voters tv had In 1008 and draw to ua about 800, 000 who Tvore against us then. Con sequently It Is of euprcmo Importance that wo enter tho impeudlng contest thoroughly united In purpoeov in prin ciple, in policy and In hearL "We owe the present Demooratic house to tho splendid record of tho iouee Democrats of the Gist congress and we owe our present Improved vastly improved status in tho coun try to that record, plus the magni ficent rclcord of the Democrats lu both house and senato at tho extra ordinary session of tho present con gress. It was a record glorified bv unparalellod unity of purposo and of action and by constructive (States manship of high character. Wo set tho pace for futuro congresses as to quantity and quality of legislative work done. It detracts nothing whatsoever from our record that the president nullified by his vetoes the bonoficient results which would have flowed from our enlightened and pa triotic endeavors. "We made our record; he made his. The people the court of last reBort in politics must decide the case upon thoso records next November, Wo await their decision with confidence and hone, believing that as we stand their friends here, they will provo to be our friends at the ballotbox. "Theio is no reason why we should not make as superb a record at this regular session as we made at the extraordinary session. Tn that faith we have entered upon our arduous, important and multifarious duties to the end and In the expectation that if we present a united front during this session and go on redeeming our promises as wo did at the extraor dinary session, Democrats everywhere will present a united front in the campaign and on election day and thereby win a sweeping victory in the cause of good government "Rome was not built in a day and it is impossible in the very nature of things to enact into law in a few days, a few weeks or even in a few months all tho reforms for which wo declared in the Denver platform. Some Umoious persons fear we have traveled too fast; some Impatient ones assert that we are too slow Judging, however, by expressions of individuals and of the public press, It may be reasonable concluded that we not only receive but what is far better that we deserve the approba tion ot nearly an uemocrats ana in dependents, as well as the endorse ment of jnany patriotic Republicans. "Tho results of the November elec tions demonstrate conclusively that tho Republicans campaign canaid which has been overworked many times to the effect that Democratic supremacy breeds panics has been ex ploded forever for the places where national Issues and national issues alone were considered were the very nlnccs where Democrats did the best This was notnbly tho case in Massa chusetts and in Joe Taggart's Con gressional district in Kansas and in Dan V. Stephens district in Nebras ka "Evidently the people "believe that tho plan we agreed upon and pro ceeded upon to reiso tho tariff sched ue by schedule is wise That being tho case we will go on as we have begun, revising tho tariff on Demo cratic linos, proceeding as rapidly as it Is possible to revise it in a care ful, scientific and painstaking way. In performing this patriotic and diffi cult task and in performing other patriotic and difficult tasks we Invite tho aid ,comfort and assistance of all Democrats and of all who love justico and who desire tho prosperity of the people and of all tho people "On matters of principle there Bhould be absolutely no compromise even to secure and retain unity but each and every one should be willing to yield on non-essentials which are not matters of principle for the gen eral good In the efforts which we are making for better government "The Renublicans seem to bo utter ly demoralized and split to pieces. It looks as though nothing short of a miracle will reunite them. It is not, however, the part of wisdom for us to rely for success upon their dis sensions, for they may accidentally get together. That their quarrels, unless composed, will help us there can be no question. Our chief reli ance for success is to give to the peo ple such a record for honest, intel ligent, courageous constructive states manship as to convinco the country Voyond the shadow of a doubt that wo are worthy of the continued and en larged confidence of the public. That is the stralghtest, plainest, shortest and easiest road to complete success Pursuing that line of conduct, victory will porch upon our bannors whether tho Republicans natch up their differ ences or not. We hold our own for tunes absolutely in our own hands. I ot us not lose our golden onDortunitv LEGAL.

He started early In tho day to fly from Buelle, Hampshire to Eastbourne, on tho sea coast. Ho was driven out to sea by a galo and his aeroplane wa plunged into tho water. RICHARD CRANE OlESjjIODEILY CHICAGO. Jan. S. Richard T. Crane, head of tne Crane company, and foe of universities and higher ed ucational Institutions, died at his homo here tonight alter a three dayB' illness of la grippe. Mr. Crano's illness had not been considered serious. Nearly SO years old, Mr. Crane, uu iii iu ijuoii wjiuouL uavaniages or disadvantages, as he characterized It of training iu universities and had worked his way to tho head of a large Iron working company, contended all his life that tho college and tho uni versity was a worthless fixture and that the money devoted to higher cQ ucation could bo spent moro profit able in extending industrial educa tion and aiding persons who had met with adversity. His death occurred within a fow hours of tho issue of his last at tack on schools an attack called forth by repudiation of his theory by college professors and presidents. Richard Teller Crane was born In Patterson, N. J., In 1S32. Martin Ryorson of Chicago gave him his start when he set aside a piece ot land on which Crano could start a brass foundry. From that grew the Crane company Mr. Crane's philanthropy was de voted chiefly to his efforts to have school boards supplant high schools with manual training schools, "to give tho student a knowledge of how to use his head and hand In con junction with each other and to glvo him a means of doing that thing for which all education Is Intended, earn ing a living for himself and for the family he will or should have." To 'point the way he founded Crane Technical institute, a school designed to carry out his idea, and supported it generously. His Last Attack-. CHICAGO, Jan. 8. Concluding a detailed announcement of investiga tion of his work accomplished by graduates of the University of Illinois, Richard T. Crane said tocjay: "The farther I go into this educa tion question, the more firmly am 1 convinced that" 1 was right whou 1 took tho ground that .some years ago that this university, as well as ail others, ought to be burned down, and money spent on them expended where it would do some gooa " Tho statement of Mr. Crane was in tho nature of an answer to articles which disputed his -statements that technical school graduates wore not In demand by business" men. Mr. Crane said his efforts wcic to learn the employment' and renumera .tlou of ciiil and-electrical. engineering graduates, graduates from -the aca demic department and the school for business training and also the agri cultural school. 'Ho declared he found only a small percentage of the civil engineers working for representative firms and they for a "remuneration of about one-third' of that commanded by a skilled mechanic." Similar conditions, ho asserts, pre vail in the case ot tho graduato from other departments. This erbal warfare against higher education has been conducted for several -vcars, most of tho timo in a pamphlet he iss'ued. Later he wrote a book in which his views were con tained , Of "his two sons, the elder, Charles Richard Crane, "was appointed minis tor to China In 1909, but resigned be fore leaving America, aftor his recall to Washington. He is not a college graduate. Ho worked In his father's mill and learned the technical engi neering in the drawing rooms and at tho lathes. Richard T. Crane, Jr., was a pro duct of tho Chicago Manual Training school and the Sheffield Scientific school, Yale university The success of the second son. who also became a department head in the company, Mr. Crane always contended, was in spite of and not as a result of his higher schooling A grandson. Richard T. Crane III., now is a student at an eastern uni versity, the views of the cider Crane not being held by his second son. BURGLARY THEORY o UouKllU IU GJDU'UIlLsJflolLy HELENA, Mont., Jan. 8. Sherill Martin lligglns and Deputy County Attornej Ed Phelan returned tonight from Marysillc, a rich mining camp 20 miles from hero, where they had gone to investigate a reported burg lary of tho postoffice, in which dna mlte was used. The officials dis credit the theory of burglary, since one door of the postoffico and all the windows were blown out, but neither safe por the stamp drawer were molested, and nothing was taken from the building. Tho dynamite charge was exploded in a hallway di rectly above the room occupied by the postoffice Tand within a fow feet of the entrance to a hall used by the minors' union and several fraternal prganizations. A hole was blown through tho ceillpg of the postoffico, but a large tauk of gasolino in a near by room on the upper floor w-ns not exploded. It Is believed that the ex plosion was a "bungling attempt to wreck the whole building, which is the largest in Marysville. t uu MONTANA OFFICER, HELD FOR SHOOTING MAN, RELEASED HELENA, Mont, Jan.

JO WORD M UN CALHOUN WASHINGTON, Jan. S. The ah senco of a reply from Minister Cal houn to the last inquiry from tho state department as to the necessity for the presence of American troops in China and a complete silence for the last 48 hours leads state depart ment officials to fear that communi cation has been cut off between Pe king and the cable station at Taku. Tho department is determined to make no move until it hears from Mr. Calhoun and consequently another message of inquiry was directed to him today. Meanwhile, the Ameri can troops at Fort McKinley, Manila, are being kept in readiness for im mediate embarkation on tho army transport as soon as Minister Cal houn gives tho word. Armistice Not Renewed. PEKING, Jan. 8. The armistice be tween the opposing imperialists and revolutionary forces has not been re newed, and negotiations between the leaders have reached a deadlock. The government expects and hopes that the revolutionary troops will move northward from Nanking and glvo opportunity for a pitched battle on ground favorable to the imperialists. The lack of funds prevents the im perial government from dispatching to the south a force strong enough to assure tho victory on which the imperialists count for command of tho situation, oo SHEEPSHEAD BAY TO BE AMPITHEATER FOR SPORTS Ir4 H "ffEW YORK, jan.

Article: Am I correct about this standard matrix and other definitions?
I have this linear transformation $T:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^3$ such that $T\left[\begin{matrix}1\\0\end{matrix}\right]=\left[\begin{matrix}2\\3\\1\end{matrix}\right]$ and $T\left[\begin{matrix}1\\5\end{matrix}\right]=\left[\begin{matrix}-3\\3\\21\end{matrix}\right]$ and I need to find the standard matrix of $T$ and I need to determine if $T$ is onto and is one to one. However I'm a little unsure of my reasoning for each one.
So, if I'm correct here, the standard matrix $A_T=(T(\vec e_1)\quad T(\vec e_2)...T(\vec e_n))$ and if we said $\vec e_1=\left[\begin{matrix}1\\0\end{matrix}\right]$ and $\vec e_2=\left[\begin{matrix}1\\5\end{matrix}\right]$, then the standard matrix $A_T=\left[\begin{matrix}1&1\\0&5\end{matrix}\right]$. Is this right? Something seems strange about it. And then since the matrix $A_T$ is linearly independent and the columns span $\mathbb R^2$, then the matrix is one to one and onto.
This is just what I have. I have a feeling it's not correct though.

Categorical error: it makes no sense to say that a matrix is (or isn't) linearly independent; that a matrix is (or isn't) one to one; that a matrix is (or isn't) onto.

You need to capitalize the second i.

@Gerry: That said, it is rather practical to conflate a matrix with the linear transformation it represents or with an ordered set of vectors as desired.

Language is a wonderful thing to abuse...

@Hurkyl, yes, once you know what you're doing --- but at the intro level I think it's most likely a sign of underlying confusion.

Despite the impression my flip remark above might leave, I would strongly second Gerry's comment. Walk before you run...

If $$T\left(\begin{matrix}1\\0\end{matrix}\right)=\left(\begin{matrix}2\\3\\1\end{matrix}\right)$$ and $$T\left(\begin{matrix}1\\5\end{matrix}\right)=\left(\begin{matrix}-3\\3\\21\end{matrix}\right)$$ so by setting $\epsilon_1=\left(\begin{matrix}1\\0\end{matrix}\right)$ and $\epsilon_2=\left(\begin{matrix}0\\1\end{matrix}\right)$ you have $\left(\begin{matrix}1\\5\end{matrix}\right)=\left(\begin{matrix}1\\0\end{matrix}\right)+5\left(\begin{matrix}0\\1\end{matrix}\right)$ and then $T(\epsilon_1)=\left(\begin{matrix}2\\3\\1\end{matrix}\right)$ and $$T(\epsilon_2)=T\left(\begin{matrix}1\\5\end{matrix}\right)-5T\left(\begin{matrix}0\\1\end{matrix}\right)=\left(\begin{matrix}-3\\3\\21\end{matrix}\right)-5\left(\begin{matrix}2\\3\\1\end{matrix}\right)=\left(\begin{matrix}-13\\-12\\17\end{matrix}\right)$$

@amWhy: good to see you. :-)

\ddot\smile @amWhy .......

$\ddot\smile;$ for you! Thanks!!

I presume by standard matrix, you mean with respect to the standard basis $e_1, e_2$?
Note that $e_2 = \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{5}\left( \begin{bmatrix}1\\5\end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} \right) $, so you can compute $T e_2 = \frac{1}{5}\left( T\begin{bmatrix}1\\5\end{bmatrix} - T\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} \right) $.
Then the standard matrix is $\begin{bmatrix}Te_1 & Te_2\end{bmatrix}$.
To see if $T$ is one to one, you need to check if $\ker T = \{0 \}$. One way is to check if $T e_1, T e_2$ are linearly independent. This also tells you the dimension of the range space, which will let you determine if $T$ is onto or not.

@ThomasAndrews: Thanks for catching that. I use cut and paste heavily to compensate for dire typing skills. If only cut and paste would compensate for memory...

Could you elaborate on why you can do what you did with the second sentence there? I'm not sure I follow.

If I understand your question properly, it is because $T$ is linear, so $T(x+y) = Tx + T y$, and $T(\lambda x) = \lambda T x$.

You're right maybe that isn't very clear. I guess I'm wondering why it is that you can compute $Te_2$ like you did.

Actually, copper did answer your question. You compute $Te_2$ the way copper did using those formulas in copper's comment.

I know, I understand that copper told me how to do it, I'm interested in why we can do that. Why is it that we can find $Te_2$ the way he did?

Well, I know what I am looking for, that is, a way to combine the two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ to get the $(0,1)$ vector. Basically solving $a v_1 + b v_2 = e_2$ and getting $a=\frac{1}{5}$ and $b=-\frac{1}{5}$.

You started out fine, but then you went wrong by redefining the standard basis vectors! $e_2$ is not the vector $\binom{5}{1}$: it is the vector $\binom{0}{1}$. If you really need to find the standard matrix, then you'll have to think about how one might go about using the information you have to figure out $T e_2$ -- e.g. by solving for $e_2$ in terms of $e_1$ and $\binom{1}{5}$.
Or, you might instead try to organize the information you're given in a fashion that's easy to do matrix arithmetic with:
$$ T \binom{1\ \ 1}{0\ \ 5} = \left(\begin{matrix}2 & -3 \\ 3 & 3 \\ 1 & 21 \end{matrix}\right)$$

Article: Apparatus and method for controlling luminance of display device

ABSTRACT

Provided an apparatus and method for controlling luminance of a display device. The apparatus includes an analog digital converter (ADC), a video processor, a control unit, and a display unit. The ADC converts input image data into a digital signal. The video processor converts the digital signal output from the ADC into a format suitable for a display module. The control unit receives the formatted signal from the video processor and converts a luminance level of the formatted signal into modified luminance levels so as to reduce differences between output luminance levels across pixel regions of the display module. The display unit displays the input image data using the formatted signal according to the modified luminance levels.
TECHNICAL FIELD

Embodiments relate to an apparatus and method for controlling luminanceof a display device.
BACKGROUND ART

LCD (liquid crystal display) devices are used for various devices suchas a television and a mobile device for displaying images using electricand optical properties of liquid crystal molecules.
Recently, more image display devices having a large size as well assmall-sized mobile devices are manufactured using LCD devices.
However, even when data of an image having a uniform luminance are inputto a large-sized LCD device, the luminance of the image can be variedaccording to pixels of the large-sized LCD device.
FIG. 1 is a view for illustrating the luminance characteristics of anLCD device.
When a current and image data are input from an inverter 10 to an LCDmodule 20, the LCD module 20 displays an image using light emitted froma lamp according to the luminance information of the image included inthe image data.
 For example, if the LCD module 20 has a 1280*1024 resolution, theluminance of each pixel of the LCD module 20 varies in the range of 0 to255 luminance levels according to the luminance of an image.
However, even when the LCD module 20 displays an image having a uniformluminance level, the luminance levels of the pixels of the LCD module 20can be different according a path of a current supplied through theinverter 10, and characteristics of the lamp and the LCD module 20.
That is, even when data of an image having the same luminance level areinput to the LCD module 20, the luminance of a first region 21 of theLCD module 20 can be different from that of a second region 22 of theLCD module 20.
For example, when image data having a luminance level corresponding to aluminance level of 250 of the LCD module 20 is input to the LCD module20, the luminance level of the first region 21 can be 250, and theluminance level of the second region 22 can be 230.
Owing to these incorrect luminance characteristics of the LCD module 20,the luminance level of the LCD module 20 can be different to theluminance level of an image by one and half times. These incorrectluminance characteristics of the LCD module 20 result in usercomplaints.
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION Technical Problem

Embodiments provide an apparatus and method for controlling luminance ofa display device so that variations of an output luminance level of thedisplay device can correspond to variations of a luminance level of aninput image when the display displays the image.
 Embodiments also provide an apparatus and method for controllingluminance of a display device so that the display device can display animage at a uniform luminance level regardless of characteristics of aliquid crystal display (LCD) module and a lamp when an input imagehaving a uniform luminance level is input to the display device.

FIG. 2 is a view illustrating a display device according to anembodiment.
FIG. 3 is a view illustrating exemplary regions of an LCD module definedaccording to pixels of the LCD module.
FIG. 4 is a view for explaining a method for controlling luminance of adisplay device according to an embodiment.
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION

Hereinafter, an apparatus and method for controlling luminance of adisplay device will be more fully described with respect to theaccompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments are shown.
FIG. 2 is a view illustrating a display device according to anembodiment.
Referring to FIG. 2, the display device includes an analog digitalconverter (ADC) 110, a video processor 120, a display unit 300, and acontrol unit 200. The ADC 110 converts R, G, and B analog signals intodigital signals using a horizontal synchronization signal. The videoprocessor 120 receives the digital signals from the ADC 110 and convertsthe digital signals into an image signal having a format suitable for aliquid crystal display (LCD) module 320 of the display unit 300. Thedisplay unit 300 displays an image using the image signal processed bythe video processor 120. The control unit 200 controls the display unit300 to operate at predetermined luminance levels according to the imagesignal processed by the video processor 120.
 The display unit 300 includes an inverter 310, lamps 330, and the LCDmodule 320. The inverter 310 applies a driving current to the lamps 330(backlight lamps) according to a control signal transmitted from thecontrol unit 200. The lamps 330 emit light according to the drivingcurrent received from the inverter 310. The LCD module 320 displays animage corresponding to the image signal transmitted from the videoprocessor 120.
The control unit 200 includes a memory unit 210 and a microprocessor220. The memory unit 210 stores luminance level conversion values forpixels of the LCD module 320. The microprocessor 220 controls the videoprocessor 120 and the luminance of the LCD module 320 using the inverterADC 110 according to the luminance level conversion values stored in thememory unit 210.
In an embodiment, the luminance of the LCD module 320 is controlled byvarying the luminance levels of pixel regions of the LCD module 320according the luminance of input image data.
In the memory unit 210, the luminance level conversion values can bestored in a lookup table for the pixels of the LCD module 320. An inputluminance level can be different from an output luminance level of theinverter 310 according to the luminance level conversion values.
In detail, when R, G, and B analog signals are input to the ADC 110, theADC 110 converts the R, G, and B signals into digital signals andoutputs the digital signals to the video processor 120.
The video processor 120 converts the digital signal into an image signaland outputs the digital signal to the LCD module 320. Furthermore, thevideo processor 120 sends information about luminance levels of theimage signal to the microprocessor 220.
The microprocessor 220 converts the luminance levels of the image signalinto modified luminance levels by calculation or using the lookup tableof the memory unit 210.
 The microprocessor 220 provides the modified luminance levels to theinverter 310 such that the inverter 310 can apply a current to the lamps330 according to the modified luminance levels.
FIG. 3 is a view illustrating exemplary regions of the LCD module 320defined according to the pixels of the LCD module.
The LCD module 320 can be divided into N regions according to the pixelsof the LCD module 320. In FIG. 3, the LCD module 320 is divided intoregions A, B, C, and D.
For example, when image data having a luminance level of 255 is input tothe LCD module 320, the luminance levels of the regions A, B, C, and Dof the LCD module 320 can be 255, 251, 248, and 245, respectively.
That is, although the luminance level of the image data is unique (255),the luminance of the LCD module 320 can vary across the A, B, C, and Dregions.
Therefore, the control unit 200 modifies the luminance level of theinput image data to operate the LCD module 320 at modified luminancelevels (luminance compensation).
For example, when the luminance level of input image data is 255, theLCD module 320 can be operated according to modified luminance levels:245 for the region A, 247 for the region B, 250 for the region C, and255 for the regions D.
In this case, the regions A, B, C, and D can have the same luminancelevel of 245. In this way, variations of luminance across the regions A,B, C, and D can be compensated.
In Table 1 below, modified luminance levels of the regions A, B, C, andD for the inverter 310 are shown according to luminance levels of inputimage data.
 TABLE 1 Luminance Level Region A Region B Region C Region D 255 245 247250 255 250 240 242 245 250 245 236 238 241 245 240 231 233 236 240 235227 229 232 235

The luminance level conversion values shown in Table 1 can be stored ina lookup table of the memory unit 210 or can be calculated by themicroprocessor 220 in real time.
For example, when the luminance level of image data received from thevideo processor 120 is 250, the microprocessor 220 can allocateluminance levels of 240, 242, 245, and 250 for the regions A, B, C, andD, respectively, by calculation or using the lookup table of the memoryunit 210. As a result, output luminance levels of the regions A, B, C,and D can approach to about 240 when the luminance level of input imagedata is 250.
The inverter 310 applies a current to the lamps 330 according to theluminance levels output from the microprocessor 220 so that the LCDmodule 320 can display an image at a uniform luminance level in responseto an input image data having a uniform luminance level.
Although the image displayed on the LCD module 320 does not have exactlythe same luminance level as that of the input image data, the differencebetween the luminance levels of the display image and input image datacan be kept constant and minimal, and luminance errors (distortions) canbe prevented.
In the case where luminance levels are modified using a lookup tablesuch as Table 1, all luminance levels of 0 to 255 can be expressed.Therefore, gray levels can be expressed without a problem.
Meanwhile, when image data having a uniform luminance level is input tothe LCD module 320, the luminance level of the LCD module 320 candecrease in a certain direction.
 For example, when the LCD module 320 is imaginarily divided into theregions A, B, C, and D as shown in FIG. 3, and image data having auniform luminance level is input to the LCD module 320, the outputluminance level of the LCD module 320 can decrease from the region A tothe region D.
For this reason, referring to each row of Table 1, the luminance levelconversion values for the regions A, B, C, and D increase from theregion A to the region D for a given luminance level of input imagedata.
In another embodiment, the uniformity of the luminance level of the LCDmodule 320 can be controlled using measured luminance level of the LCDmodule 320.
For example, when image data having a uniform luminance level of 255 areinput to the LCD module 320, the luminance levels of the regions A, B,C, and D of the LCD module 320 can be 255, 251, 248, and 200,respectively.
That is, although the input image data has a uniform luminance level,the luminance levels of the regions A, B, C, and D of the LCD module 320are largely different. Particularly, the luminance level of the region Dis much lower than that of the region A.
In this case, if the luminance level conversion values of Table 1 isallocated for the regions A, B, C, and D, the output luminance level ofthe LCD module 320 may vary largely across the regions A, B, C, and D.
 Therefore, when image data having a uniform luminance level is input tothe LCD module 320, the output luminance levels of the regions A, B, C,and D of the LCD module 320 are measured to calculate a ratio of themaximum luminance level (e.g., of the region A) to the minimum luminancelevel (e.g., of the region D) and compare the calculated ratio with acritical value. If the calculated ratio is equal to or larger than thecritical value, another lookup table such as Table 2 below can be used.
For example, the critical value can be 1.2, and when the calculatedratio is equal to or larger than 1.2, input luminance levels areproperly modified.
As explained above by example, when the output luminance levels of theregions A, B, C, and D of the LCD module 320 are 255, 251, 248, and 200,respectively, for input image data having a uniform luminance level of255, modified luminance levels of 210, 217, 220, and 255 can beallocated for the regions A, B, C, and D, respectively.
In this case, although the regions A, B, C, and D of the LCD module 320do not have an output luminance level equal to the luminance of theinput image data, the difference between the maximum output luminancelevel and the minimum luminance level is not large, and thus the outputluminance level of the LCD module 320 can be uniform. In other words,the output luminance level of the LCD module 320 can be uniform withouta region having a relatively much lower luminance level than those ofother regions.
In Table 2 below, modified luminance levels of the regions A, B, C, andD for the inverter 310 are shown according to luminance levels of inputimage data.
 TABLE 2 Luminance level Region A Region B Region C Region D 255 210 217220 255 250 205 212 215 250 245 200 207 210 245 240 195 202 205 240 235190 197 200 235

Like the case of the luminance level conversion values of Table 1, theluminance level conversion values illustrated in Table 2 can be storedin a lookup table of the memory unit 210 or can be calculated by themicroprocessor 220 in real time.
The inverter 310 applies a current to the lamps 330 according to theluminance levels output from the microprocessor 220 so that the LCDmodule 320 can display an image at a uniform luminance level in responseto an input image data having a uniform luminance level.
Here, if the luminance level of the input image data is 255, the outputluminance levels of the regions A, B, C, and D of the LCD module 320 maybe in the range from 200 to 210.
Meanwhile, applications of lookup tables such as Tables 1 and 2 can bedetermined according to the characteristics of the LCD module 320 andthe inverter 310. Although two lookup tables (Tables 1 and 2) areexplained, more lookup tables can be stored in the memory unit 210 andselectively used according to the situations.
FIG. 4 is a view for explaining a method of controlling luminance of adisplay device according to an embodiment.
Referring to FIG. 4, R, G, and B analog signals are input to an ADC 110(S410), and the ADC 110 converts the R, G, and B analog signals intodigital signals (S420).
The digital signals are converted into an image signal having a formatsuitable for an LCD module 320 (S430).
 Luminance levels are read from the image signal and are converted intomodified luminance levels for pixel regions of the LCD module 320 byusing a lookup table stored in the memory unit 210 (S440).
Then, the inverter 310 is driven according to the modified luminancelevels (S450).

Article: How to use multiple tools in one Gitlab CI job without custom docker images?
I have a couple of Gitlab CI jobs that use multiple cli tools. For example I might need to use java, nodejs, python, docker and git in the same job. This means I have two options:

Use one of the official images (node, openjdk, python, docker:dind, git) and download+install the other tools in the container every time the job runs.

I don't like this because the process of downloading and installing these tools is really redundant, slow and a waste of resources.


Create a custom image based on one of the official images and install the other tools in the image.

I don't like this because maintaining such a custom image takes a lot of time and effort especially if you want to keep everything at the latest version and it gets worse and worse the more tools you try to jam into a single image. Stability can also be an issue because some tools prefer running on an Ubuntu-based image and others might prefer an alpine base image.



Ideally, there would be a way to use multiple docker images in the same job that share a volume and arbitrarily run commands in the context of any container you want.
I know that I can specify service images on a job like this:
my_job:
  image: node:latest
  script:
    - echo "Hello World"
  services:
    - name: mysql:latest
      alias: mysql
    - name: redis:latest
      alias: redis

and then access them over the network, addressing them by using the alias as the domain.
But that wouldn't be of much help in case of an official image like node because these images don't host any network services.
Any ideas how this can be done? Is there some sort of best practice?
(I know that in some cases it would be possible to split that one job into multiple jobs that each run a single command, passing the output as an artifact to the next job, but that can quickly become inefficient and hard to read.)
Edit: Moved some of the ideas I had into the answer.

It's pretty common to build and maintain your own image. You even have a CI server there to do it.

That is true and you are totally right about that, but if you want to always use the latest versions for most of the tools and you are using a lot of tools within one image, you will end up having to do a lot of manual maintenance work (for example because new dependencies are required for later versions or dependencies are conflicting).

This page is likely very relevant for you... particularly: What services are not for and Shared /builds directory

@Attie Thank you, that is very valuable information!

I came up with a complex workaround that covers most of the basics. If you add this to the top of your .gitlab-ci.yml, you can run commands in the context of any service:
.remote_exec_server: &remote_exec_server
  - "sh"
  - "-c"
  - |
    mkdir -p "$CI_PROJECT_DIR" && cd "$CI_PROJECT_DIR"
    while true; do
      nc -l -p 83 -e sh -c '{
        IFS="|" read -r stdin_base64 cmd_base64
        stdout_file=$(mktemp)
        stderr_file=$(mktemp)
        echo -n "$stdin_base64" | base64 -d | sh -c "$(echo "$cmd_base64" | base64 -d)" > $stdout_file 2> $stderr_file
        echo "${?}|$(cat $stdout_file | base64 -w 0)|$(cat $stderr_file | base64 -w 0)"
        rm -f $stdout_file $stderr_file
      }'
    done

.remote_exec_client: &remote_exec_client |
  # Usage: svc_run SERVICE_NAME COMMAND [COMMAND_PARAMS]... # (Supports stdin, stdout, stderr and exit code)
  svc_run() {
    local stdin_base64=$(base64 -w 0)
    local host="$1"; shift
    local cmd_base64="$(echo "$*" | base64 -w 0)"
    echo "${stdin_base64}|${cmd_base64}" | nc $host 83 | {
      IFS='|' read -r exit_code stdout_base64 stderr_base64
      echo "$stdout_base64" | base64 -d
      echo "$stderr_base64" | base64 -d 1>&2
      return $exit_code
    }
    return $?
  }

Data is shared via the /builds directory automatically. (Thanks to @Attie for pointing that out.)
Now you can create jobs that can access any of the services. Here is a proof of concept demonstrating the use of python, nodejs and java from the same job:
(Note the use of command: *remote_exec_server on every service.)
variables:
    CI_DEBUG_SERVICES: "true" # Show services output in GitLab CI log

before_script:
  - *remote_exec_client

helloworld:
  image: alpine:3.17.3
  services:
    - name: node:18.16.0-alpine3.17
      alias: node
      command: *remote_exec_server
    - name: python:3.11.3-alpine3.17
      alias: python
      command: *remote_exec_server
    - name: amazoncorretto:8-alpine3.17-full
      alias: jdk
      command: *remote_exec_server
  script:
    # Python test
    - svc_run python python --version
    - echo 'print("Hello, world from python!")' | svc_run python python

    # Java test
    - svc_run jdk java -version
    - echo "public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(\"Hello, World from Java!\");
        }
      }" > HelloWorld.java
    - svc_run jdk "javac HelloWorld.java && java HelloWorld" # compile and execute a java program from the given source file

    # NodeJS test
    - svc_run node node -v
    - svc_run node npm -v
    - echo 'console.log("Hello, world from nodejs!")' | svc_run node node

    # Advanced NodeJS test
    - echo '{"scripts":{"test":"mocha test.js"},"devDependencies":{"mocha":"^10.2.0"}}' > package.json
    - echo "const assert = require('assert');
      describe('My Test Suite', () => {
        it('should pass the test', () => {
          assert.strictEqual(2 + 2, 4);
        });
      });" > test.js
    - svc_run node npm install
    - svc_run node npm run test

Limitations

One disadvantage (due to my limited shell scripting knowledge) is that stdin and stdout/stderr aren't streamed in real time, meaning a long running command will not produce any output, until it completely finished execution.
The remote execution server/client relies on netcat (nc) which unfortunately isn't preinstalled in all docker images. I've only tested it with alpine-based images and that seems to work fine so far. One way to work around that might be to copy a statically built version of nc into the builds directory in the before_script and tell the server to wait for it to exist.

Please note that GitLab CI services are not officially meant to be used that way.

Donnerstag Nr. 5. 15. Jänner 1870. Feldkirch, 24. Januar. Es wetterleuchtet, donnert und blitzt drüben, wir sprechen heut nur von der Art und Weise, wie die Resolutionen des "Vereines der Verfassungsfreunde", d.h., seine in der Verfassungsfrage gefassten Beschlüsse, und über andere Gegenstände wurde nicht verhandelt, beantwortet werden. Man will Vorwürfe zurückweisen, gibt sich aber keine Mühe, die Gründe der Gegenpartei auch widerlegen, Politisieren wir also nochmals, obwohl es uns bald zum Überdrusse wird, Antworten zu verlangen, die entweder nicht gegeben werden oder nur aufweichend ausfallen. Ihr Führer eines Teiles einer deutschen Bevölkerung in einem kerndeutschen Lande steht im Bunde mit den leidenschaftlichsten Gegnern des Deutschtums in Österreich. Das ist eine Wahrheit, und so lange Ihr uns nicht haarscharf das Gegentheil beweisen könnt, bleibt es eine Wahrheit, und wird es auch bleiben; denn gegen offenkundige Tatsachen sind keine Beweise möglich. Als Führer werdet Euch zwar auf Leugnen und Verdrehen verlegen, womit Ihr immer etwas ausrichtet bei Jenen, welche Ihr an der Nase herumzuführen gewohnt seid. Dennoch erheben wir unsere Stimme, um Euch den Vorwurf in's Gesicht zu schleudern, büßt Ihr alles besudelt und beschmutzt, was in Österreich der deutsche Geist geleistet und begründet hat; wir erheben unsere Stimme, um Euch zu sagen, dass Ihr den Eurigen dazu beitragt, um die Deutschen in Österreich zu "schmachbedeckten Heloten" zu machen. Leute, die aus dem schon oft genug amputierten österreichischen Staats-Körper noch weitere unabhängige Staaten heraus schneiden wollen, die den Deutschen in Böhmen verbieten möchten, Österreicher zu sein; Leute, die einen durch deutsche Waffen schon vor Jahrhunderten zertrümmerten Staat wieder aufrichten wollen, um ihn von Österreich so viel als möglich loszureißen und mehr als zwei Millionen Deutsche zu unterjochen, sind Eure Bundesgenossen. Ist das nicht Aller? Ist Eure Stirne frech genug, das zu leugnen? Thut, was Ihr wollt. Die Tatsache steht fest, dass Ihr jenen gehörig, welche unsere Stammesbrüder mit der Vernichtung bedrohen. Während jedes Nationalen, sei es auch noch so klein, rühmsüchtig auf seine Erfindung ist, treibt Ihr, deutsche Männer, ein sauberes Handwerk. Verzeiget uns, wenn wir Euch deutsche Männer nennen, es geschieht bloß deshalb, weil Euch deutsche Mütter geboren. Was Ihr anstrebt, was Ihr tut, haben wir Euch gesagt, geht fragen wir aber: Wollen Eure Leute, dass in Österreich Attentat auf ihre eigene Nationalität gelinge? Nein - das wollen sie nicht, so gewiss nicht, als die Liebe zum eigenen Volke, diese so natürliche Liebe bei unseren Landsleuten nie mehr unterdrückt werden kann. Wir kommen nun zum zweiten Teil Eurer politischen Thätigkeit, indem wir die besondere Stellung Vorarlbergs zu Österreich genauer ins Auge fassen, eine Stellung die ganz die gleiche Geltung, wenn seine Bewohner nicht deutsch, sondern irgend ein Anderes redeten. Klein sind wir einmal, ein Vorarlberger Staatsrecht nützt uns nichts, eine Vorarlberger Staatsbürgerschaft ebenso wenig. Ist es nun nicht zu unserem offenen Schaden, wenn der Umfang des Gebietes der österreichischen Staatsbürger immer kleiner wird, wenn außer dem ungarischen noch ein schweizerisch oder gar ein böhmischer Staat entstehen? Droht uns nicht die größte Gefahr, wenn nach ungarischem Beispiel noch ein weiterer Ausgleich geschaffen wird, der Jenen, die man dazu zwingt, den größten Teil der Schulden überlässt? Kann es uns gleichgültig sein, wenn wir nach einer weiteren Zersplitterung der Reichsvertretung nicht mehr in der Lage sind mitzuraten und unser Votum abzugeben, wenn über Angelegenheiten entschieden wird, die unsere Zukunft, unsere Existenz tief berühren? Soll es uns gleichgültig sein, wem in Österreich, das wir unser Vaterland nennen, die Freizügigkeit beschränkt wird, wenn Böhmen und Polen die Deutschen als Ausländer betrachten? Antwort ist uns doch auf alle diese Fragen. Wenn Ihr es aber nicht könnt, so beschweret Euch nicht darüber, dass Eure Tätigkeit den Unwillen der Patrioten hervorruft. Doch wir sind mit unseren Fragen noch nicht zu Ende. Da Ihr Euch als Volksmänner gebärden, so sagt uns einmal: Was habt Ihr für das Volk geleistet? Es ist Euch jüngst der Vorwurf gemacht worden, dass Ihr zu jener Zeit Euch wohl befunden habt, wo man mittels eines allumfassenden Polizeiapparats unsere Herzen und Nieren prüfte, ob nicht eine Spur von Freiheitsdrang darin zurückgeblieben. Ja, Ihr waret die Anwärter der Gewalt, Eure Leute waren es, die damals regierten. Der große Bach und der jetztige Wühlhuber Tunn waren und sind Ultramontane vom reinsten Wasser. Beide haben die zarte Freiheitspflanze von 1843 entblättert, zerschnitten und zuletzt mit ihren Wurzeln aus der Erde gerissen. Die Liberalen mussten unter unsäglichen Schwierigkeiten das Saamenkorn wieder in die Erde legen und sie ruhten nimmer. Wir fürchten nicht, dass sie die Oberhand gewinnt und sind deshalb sicher, dass sich Heide Hänser mit Mehrheit im Sinne des Adressentwurfs des Herrenhauses von Graf Auerfeld aussprechen werden. Wir müssen uns darauf beschränken, die hervorragendsten Stellen desselben zu bringen, welche auf das Bedauern der Thronrede über die Oppositionen der Nationalitäten Antwort geben. Es sind die bedeutsamen, kräftigen Worte, welche die gewissenlosen Gleichspieliker mit vernichtender Wucht treffen. Es sind die nämlichen Gedanken, welche die Verfassungsfreunde von Vorarlberg in ihrer letzten Versammlung ausgesprochen haben. Die Stelle in der Adresse lautet wörtlich: Das Herrenhaus teilt das lebhafte Bedauern, dass den Grundlagen des legislativen Schaffens in der Verfassung die tatsächliche und allgemeine Anerkennung von mancher Seite noch verweckt wird, aber es darf seine Überzeugung nicht unausgesprochen lassen, dass es sich bei dem Bestehen und auf dem Standpunkt einer nach reiflicher Erwägung mit voller Rechts-giltigkeit zu Stande gekommenen Verfassung wohl nicht mehr darum handeln könne, für deren tatsächliche und allgemeine Anerkennung erst zu werben, sondern nur darum, dieser Verfassung durch ausdauernde Handhabung und sorgfältige Durchführung, durch treue beharrliches Festhalten und Übermachung des in ihr gewonnenen Rechtsbodens allenthalben Achtung und Geltung zu verschaffen. Eine vom Geiste der Verfassung durchdrungene, einheitlich in sich geschlossene Regierung, die dabei auch die Mittel in sich selbst, um widerstrebenden Elementen wirksam zu begegnen, besitzt, hiebei auch die Mittel in sich selbst, um widerstrebenden Elementen wirksam zu begegnen. Auf diesem Wege allein wird aber auch jene allgemeine tatsächliche Anerkennung, insoweit sie überhaupt erreichbar ist, allmählich erworben werden. Den Ansprüchen der Königreiche und Länder, ihre besonderen Verhältnisse auf eine ihnen entsprechende Weise selbst ordnen zu können, ist, unseres Erachtens, durch die Bestimmungen der Verfassung jeder mit dem Bestand und der Machtstellung des Reiches vereinbarer Spielraum bereits gegeben. Es ist insbesondere bei der erst in der letzten Session stattgehabten Verfassungsveranstaltung in dieser Richtung mit Zugeständnissen weittragender Art bis an den äußersten Rand jener Grenze vorgegangen worden, welche bestehen muss und nicht überwindlich werden darf, wenn die Gewalt der Gesetzgebung nicht zu Gunsten von Sonderstellungen einzelner Königreiche und Länder empfindlich geschwächt, die allgemeine Wohlfahrt nicht tief erschüttert und der Reichsverband selbst nicht weiterer Lockerung und allmählicher Auflösung preisgegeben werden soll. Erfüllt von dem lebhaftesten österreichischen Gefühl, spricht das Herrenhaus es daher offen an, dass es für Veränderungen der Verfassung in der bezeichneten Richtung nicht das Wort zu führen vermag. In der bayerischen Kammer hat der Zweikampf zwischen den Liberalen und den Patrioten wieder begonnen. Die letzteren verfügen über acht Stimmen mehr als die Gegner und benutzen dieses Übergewicht, um insoweit es geht, die für die Fortschritts-Partei günstigen Wahlresultate anzufechten. Die Patrioten wollen keinen Pardon geben. Der nochmalige Ausbruch einer Minister-Krise in München gehört somit nicht zu den unmöglichen Dingen. Die Präsidentenwahlen fielen selbstverständlich ultramonarchistisch aus. Paris ist in ungeheurem Aufruhr in Folge eines traurigen Ereignisses. Prinz Peter Bonaparte hat den Journalisten Viktor Noir gelöwen. Der „Constitutionnel" teilt folgende Details über den Vorgang mit: Der Prinz warf Nochefort in einem Briefe vor, ihn vermittelst der Feder eines seiner Werkzeuge persönlich beleidigt zu haben. Am 11. d.J. begaben sich Viktor Noir und Ulrich Fonvielle zum Prinzen, als Kartellträger Pascal Grousset's, welcher den betreffenden Artikel der „Marseillaise" unterzeichnet hatte. Als jene Herren eingetreten waren, fragte sie der Prinz: ob sie die von Nochefort geschickten „Werkzeuge" seien. Hierauf schlug Viktor Noir dem Prinzen heftig ins Gesicht, und Fonvielle, der ohne Zweifel eine Erwiderung von Seiten des Letzteren vorhersah, zog einen Revolver aus seinem Paletot. Gegen einen so gewaltigen Angriff gegenüber nahm der Prinz rasch eine Pistole von einer Waffen-Etagere und gab Feuer auf Viktor Noir, welcher verwundet noch die Treppe hinabging und dort umfiel. Der Justizminister ordnete die unmittelbare Verhaftung Peter Bonaparte's an, und der Kaiser hat diese Maßregel gebilligt. Die gerichtliche Untersuchung hat bereits begonnen. — Das offizielle Journal veröffentlich ein Dekret, das den höchsten Gerichtshof zusammenberuft, um über Peter Bonaparte wegen der gegen ihn erhobenen Anklage auf Tötung ab zu urteilen. Von der Sprache, die der bekannte Nochefort in seinem Blatt „Marseillaise" führt, wollen wir unseren Lesern als Probe das mittheilen, was er über diese Affäre schreibt. Es heißt: „Mord, begangen durch den Prinzen Peter Napoleon Bonaparte an dem Bürger Viktor Noir. Mordversuch, begangen durch den Prinzen Peter Napoleon Bonaparte an dem Bürger Ulrich v. Fonvielle. Ich hatte die Schwäche zu glauben, dass ein Bonaparte etwas anderes sein könnte als ein Mörder. Ich hatte gewagt mir einzubilden, dass ein loyales Duell in dieser Familie möglich wäre, wo der Mord und der Hinterhalt Tradition und Brauch sind. Mein Mitarbeiter Paschal Gronsset hat meinen Irrtum geheilt, und heute beweinen wir unser armes und liebes Freund Viktor Noir, den der Bandit Peter Napoleon Bonaparte ermordet hat. Seit 18 Jahren befindet sich Frankreich in den blutbefleckten Händen dieser Gurgelabschneider, welche, nicht damit zufrieden, die Republikaner in den Straßen niederzukämpfen, sie in schmutzige Fallen locken und sie zu Hause zu erwürgen. Französisches Volk! Findest du nicht, dass es jetzt genug ist? Henri Nochefort. Die zweite feierliche Sitzung des Concils ist nicht ganz nach dem Wunsch der päpstlichen Curie ausgefallen, und die da bei von derselben erwarteten Resultate sind keineswegs zur praktischen Geltung gekommen. Vor einigen Tagen hielte nämlich Pius IX. die Patriarchen der orientalischen Riten um sich versammelt und ihnen mit Aufwand vieler Beredsamkeit ausgemacht, wie ungemein nützlich für das Seelenheil ihrer Sprenger es wäre, wenn sie sich sämtlich der allgemeinen römischen Kirche anschließen und gleichsam in derselben, als ihrem gemeinschaftlichen Mittelpunkte, aufgehen würden. Zugleich enthielt er ihnen als Oberhaupt dieser allgemeinen Kirche den väterlichen Willen, vor Allem freiwillig und im Angesicht des jetzt tagenden ökumenischen Concils auf das Recht zu verzichten, die Bischöre im ganzen Umfang ihrer patriarchalischen Diözesen selbstständig zu wählen, welches ihnen bekanntlich nach den orientalischen Satzungen von uralten Zeiten her zusteht. Mit dieser vom Papst Pius in seiner üblichen salbungsvollen und einschmeichelnden Weise vorgetragenen Proposition stieß er aber einmal an einen energischen Widerstand, der ihn so aus der Fassung brachte, dass er sich, wie im Vatikan die Sagen geht, mehrere Stunden nach dieser ansregenden Szene nicht erholen konnte. Der Patriarch von Konstantinopel erklärte sich nämlich, gleich nachdem der Papst seine Ansprache beendet hatte, mit erhobener Stimme auf die entschiedenste Weise gegen ein so unerwartetes Ansinnen, welches, wenn es zur Ausführung käme, die von den Altvornehmern ererbten Institutionen der morgenländischen Kirche gänzlich über den Haufen werfen müsste. Auch die anderen bei der Audienz anwesenden Patriarchen schlossen sich den von ihrem ehrwürdigen Mitbruder geäußerten Überzeugungen unbedingt und einstimmig an und gaben die einhellige Erklärung ab, dass sie sich dem Fall in gar keine weitere Erörterung mehr einzulassen gesonnen seien, worauf sie sich mit lauten Ausrufungen der Missbilligung sämtlich aus dem päpstlichen Gemächer entfernten. (Silbersechser.) Zufolge Ministerial-Bestimmung werden die Sechser-Kreuzerstücke vom Jahre 1343 und 1349 im Wege der Zahlung oder Verwechslung noch bis Ende Jänner 1370 bei den Steuerämtern angenommen. Diese Münze strömt noch zahlreich aus dem Auslande, wo sie einen echten Silberklang halten, nach dem heimatlichen Boden zurück und ist auch noch hierlandS häufig im Publikum verbreitet, da der ErziehungStern ein wohl zu kurz gegriffen sein mochte. Geschäftsleute dürften daher kein Risiko auf sich laden, wenn sie diese Münzsorten wenigstens noch im Semester, ohne Provisions-Verlangen im Verkehr annehmen, und so der Staatsverwaltung in ihrem Streben entgegenkommen, durch den UmlagerungSorte unsere Monarchie mit der neuen klin genden Scheidemünze in hinreichendem Bedarf zu versehen. Übrigens wäre eine Erinnerung zur Einziehung der genannten Silbersechser (keineswegs aber auch der abfälligen Papierzehner) um einen oder zwei Monate sicher im Interesse des allgemeinen Verkehres gelegen (Aufhebung des Zeitungsstempels in Ungarn). Das königlich ungarische Ministerium hat von Neujahr 1870 an den Zeitungsstempel im Gebiet der ungarischen Krone aufgehoben, dagegen die Stempelpflicht andlicher Zeitungen aufrecht erhalten. Werden die in Ungarn erscheinenden Zeitungen, Ankündigungs- oder Anzeigeblätter in die vom Reichsrat vertretenen diesseitigen Königreiche und Länder eingeschrieben, so müssen sie beim Grenzübertritt, unter Haftung des Empfängers, mit dem österreichischen Stempel von 1 Kreuzer für jedes Exemplar versehen werden. Wir begrüßen die erstgenannte Auflassung des Zeitungsstempels, welcher die literarische Tätigkeit auf dem Gebiete der Tagespresse so sehr hemmt, als einen wohlbegründeten Ausfluss einer zeitgemäßen Gesetzgebung in Ungarn und knüßt daran die Erwartung, dass auch die diesseitige österreichische Monarchie auf dieser Bahn ehestens nachfolgen will und uns die Schranken, die uns auf ungünstige Weise von Ungarn trennt, wobei wir bei dieser Stempelfrage wie das Ausland behandelt werden, vergessen lässt. Hoffen wir auf günstige Entscheidung unseres Reichsrates, dem bereits eine hierauf hinzielende Petition vorliegt. Auch für die Auflassung oder wenigstens für eine bedeutende Herabmindrung der mit 31 kr. unverhältnismäßig hoch gegriffenen Zeitungs-Inscinationsebieth hier ist ein Platz, der sich als ein Hemmschuh nicht nur für die Presse, sondern auch für den Verkehr darstellt, muss entschieden das Wort ergriffen werden, zumal es scheint, dass die diesseitige Gesetz in einzelnen Provinzen verschieden streng gehandhabt wird. (Fabrik-Inspektoren.) Nach dem Gesetzentwurf betreffend die Regelung des Verhältnisses zwischen Arbeitsgebern und Hilfsarbeitern, werden Fabrikinspektoren vom Staat als überwachende Organe bestellt werden, die die Einhaltung der zum Schutz der Arbeiter gegebenen Gesetze sicherzustellen haben. Die Fabrikinspektoren werden jedoch nicht einseitig als Vertreter der Arbeiter sein, sondern auch die Interessen der Arbeitsgeber wahrzunehmen und beiderseits wohlthätig vermittelnd zu wirken haben. Der Fabrikinspektor hat die Überzeugung zu verschaffen, ob das Gesetz wirklich durchgeführt wird und hat auf Beseitigung vorkommender Übelstände sofort einzudringen. Deshalb genießt er in Ausübung seiner Funktionen die Rechte der öffentlichen Beamten. Er ist berechtigt, sämtliche Fabrikslokationen und die Fabrikschule zu besichtigen, in die im Gesetz bezeichneten Verzeichnisse, Arbeitsbücher und Reglemente Einsicht zu nehmen, alle ihm geeigneten Personen zu vernehmen, nötigenfalls unmittelbar einzuschreiten und Hilfe der politischen Behörden anzurufen. Jeder Fabrikinspektor wird wenigstens einmal im Jahre sämtliche ihm unterstehende Fabriken besuchen und jährlich einen Hauptbericht an den Handelsminister erstatten. Diese Berichte sollen veröffentlicht werden. Ausdrücklich ist den Fabrikinspektoren untersagt, von den Fabrikbesitzern oder deren Stellvertretern ein Nachtlager oder eine Mahlzeit anzunehmen. In Götzen, 13. Jänner. (Zur Ergänzung) Entweder Herr Pfarrer oder es haben die „Schmutzblätter" wie die meisten Zeitungen, das „Vorarlberger Volksblatt" natürlich Ausgenommen zu nennen pflegt, gelogen. Er sagte nämlich am 2. Jänner von der Kanzel: „An der Geschichte von Barbara Bryk ist kein Körnchen Wahres, wie sie in solchen Berichten worden ist". Dem Pfarrer muss man glauben; denn was der von der Kanzel sagt, ist heilig. Etwas muss doch hinter jener Geschichte stecken; es ist keine Zeitung so schlecht, als sie eine so schauderhafte Begebenheit als reine Erfindung in die Öffentlichkeit gäbe. Wer lügt hier? (Wenn auch die gerichtliche Untersuchung für die Klosterfrauen einig schwer Gravierendes ergeben hat, als man anfänglich annehmen musste, wo sogar der Bischof von Krakau sich bei Anblick des armen Geschöpfes zum bekannten Ausdruck: „Ihr seid Fürien und keine Weiber" hinreißen ließ, so steht die Tatsache fest, dass eine Person ohne Vorwissen des Gerichtes jahrelang in einem abscheulichen Loch eingesperrt war, und es ist erklärungsreich, dass so etwas nur möglich ist. Weniger gegen die Klosterfrauen, als gegen die schreckliche Ordensregel empört sich das Rechtsgefühl. In Götzen, 12. Jänner (Schulwesen). In der hierigen Schule werden die Kinder verhalten, die Stoffsammlung von Künste anzuschaffen. Da die Zulassung der Lehrbücher Sache der Landes Schulbehörde ist, kommt es nur seltsam vor, wie man das katholisch-pädagogische Machwerk so ohne weiteres ohne Bewilligung einführen darf. In Bregenzerwald, 12 Jänner. (Lehre ränge ich genheit.) Mehr als 30 Lehrer aus Vorarlberg waren bei dem Lehrertage in St. Gallen und Alle gingen mit dem Entschlüsse heim: „Ein Verein von Lehrern muß auch im Vorarlberg sein. So der Rechenschaftsbericht des kath. pävag Vereines. Fürwahr, es war ein herrlicher Gedanke! Wir besprachen denselben auf unserer Heimreise aus der Schweiz mit der vollsten Begeisterung. Denn wir hatten dort gesehen, was die Lehrerschaft ist und sein soll. Es war eben in der freien Schweiz, wo sich alle Teile derselben, die Lehrer ohne Unterschied des Ranges, der Konfession und der Gesinnung zu einem und demselben edlen Zwecke vereinigten. Auch von uns Österreichern sprach man dort und Vorarlberger sprachen auch und zwar in einer Weise, daß wenigstens die Tendenz ihrer Reden den ausgezeichnetsten Belohnung verdiente. Und wie wurde nun jener herrliche Gedanke ausgeführt? Leider nicht in dem Sinne, wie er dort geherrscht. Wir haben keinen Lehrerverein bekommen. Die, die es unternommen, einen solchen zu gründen, ließen sich zu sehr von einer Partei leiten, und es entstand vielmehr ein Verein von Pfarrern und Kaplanen und durch ihn ein Mittel, dass die Lehrer, die durch das neue Gesetz von der alten Botmäßigkeit befreit wurden, auch noch sorgen getreue Knechte jener Herren zu sein das Vergnügen haben. Das Prinzip eines Lehrervereins ist und kann nur das sein, Schule und Lehrerstand zu haben. Wie es diese Leute aber in der Beziehung meinen, ist bekannt genug. Wer es noch nicht weiß, der soll sich in solchen Herren nur ein Gespräch einlassen und er erfährt, dass unsere Lehrer genug Bildung, unsere Schule so gut wie die im Auslande, das neue Schulgesetz aber ein Unsinn sei. Gewiss Beweis genug, dass ihnen am allerwenigsten um Verbesserung der Schule, um Hebung des Lehrerstandes zu tun ist. Denn wem es um Erneuerung der Schule, um Hebung des Lehrerstandes zu tun ist, der muss auch dessen Mängel, nicht im Inneren dessen Vorzüge hervorheben. — Aber natürlich, an Mängeln glaubt man gar nicht. Oder soll vielleicht das in neuerer Zeit vielbesprochene Aussatzbuch alle dies Gesagte Lügen strafen? Nun, denn wir leben in einer Zeit, wo es gediegene Schulbücher gibt. Ich genaue mir die Versicherung zu geben, dass der, welcher z. B. Kleins Werke lenkt, keine Anwandlung empfindet, die Künstliche „Stoffsammlung" zu wählen. „Ein Verein von Lehrern soll auch im Vorarlberg sein". Dao iolte nun nach dritten Hälften wieder Lösung werden; aber diesmal sollte sie sich bewähren. Es sollte ein eigenlicher Lehrerverei gegründet werden. Viele, viele Lehrer Vorarlbergs sind voll Erwartung, dass diese recht bald geschehen möge. Zu versichtlich wäre zu erwarten, dass die tüchtigsten Kräfte des Landes betreten würden und dass er daher mit gutem Erfolge jeder Art wirken könnten. Und wäre ein solcher Schritt wohl zu einer Zeit wünschen wertiger als gerade jetzt? Jetzt, wo es sich darum handelt, den neuen Gesetzen Eingang und volle Geltung zu verschaffen, wo jene so thätig sind, die nicht für Schule und Lehrer sind. Berufstreue Lehrer können da unmöglich dem Indifferenzsinndigen huldigen, es muß ihnen an der Sache gelegen sein und wird sich solches auch zeigen. Also vorwärts! Innsbruck, 11. Jänner. (Gegen die Landtags-Majorität) haben sich neben den Gemeindeverwaltungen von Salzburg, von Wilen und der großen Gemeinde Ampezzo ausgesprochen. (Über den Weiberrummel in Tarrenz) berichtet der T. Bote folgendes: Bekanntlich sträubten sich die Tarreiner gegen die Einführung der Lesebücher in die Schule. Da ließ die Bezirkshauptmannschaft die betreffenden neuen Schulbücher nach Tarrenz schaffen, wo sie in einem Hause an der Imst entgegengeleitet wurden. Am 7. d. M., kam der Amtssdiener der k.k. Bezirkshauptmannschaft dorthin, um die Bücher zu verteilen. Schon Tage zuvor soll dort eine auf den Empfang des Amtssdienern bezügliche Parole ausgegeben worden sein. Im Dorf wurde er von einer Schaar Volk, zunächst Weiber, mit Gejohle und argen Drohungen empfangen. Er flüchtete sich in die Schule; als er über die Treppe hinaufstieg, wollten ihn noch Einige bei den Rockschößen von derselben herunterreißen, doch gelang es ihm glücklich in das Schulzimmer zu kommen. Dort traf er den Herrn Kooperator und einigen Kindern und als er gesagt hatte, weshalb er von der Bezirkshauptmannschaft geschickt worden sei, wie es ihm der Herr Koordinator die Tür mit dem Bedeuten, der Amtsdiener habe hier nichts zu schaffen. Er mußte sich daher nun wieder auf die Gasse unter die beehrte Menge begeben. Unter dem gleichen Geheul und den gleichen Drohungen des Pöbels gelangte er endlich in die Schule nach Obertarrenz. Dort fand er den Herrn Kurer und einen Gemeinderat. Er richtete seinen Auftrag aus, und die Beiden geleiteten ihn sodann bis außerhalb des Dorfes, von wo er unbehelligt den Rückweg nach Imst antrat. Die gerichtliche Untersuchung soll bereits eingeleitet sein. Ob sie die Aufwiegler finden wird? Schweiz, Bern. (Das Gotthard-Committee) sieht sich von Schwierigkeiten aller Art von allen Seiten umringt, wie der „Bund" schreibt und das voreilige Frohlocken nach dem Bekanntwerden des Concurrenzprotokolls, dass jetzt das große Unternehmen als gesichert zu betrachten sei, dürfte nicht zumindest dazu beigetragen haben, ihm seine Stellung zu erschweren, wenigsten in der Schweiz, wo Unverstand und Selbstsucht vielfach, und namensreich in Tessin, die egoistische Sicht geltend machen: die Gotthardbahn werde so wieso hergestellt, man habe jetzt nur dafür zu sorgen, so wenig als möglich an dieselbe bezahlen zu müssen. Wenn demnach die Gotthardbahn-Frage nicht unter so günstigen Anspängen in das neue Jahr eintritt wie viele noch im Oktober hofften, so bieten andererseits die Persönlichkeiten, welche an der Verwirklichung der großen Verkehrsidee arbeiten, die Gewähr, dass sie das Projekt, bei dem nicht bloss ihr Interesse, sondern auch ihre Ehre beteiligt ist, nicht aufgeben werden ohne das Äußerste versucht zu haben. Unter solchen Umständen wäre es ebenso vorhinein vor dem Gelingen des Unternehmens zu verzweifeln, als es verfrüht war, dasselbe im Oktober schon als gesichert zu erklären. Lokales. Wenn auch die „Feldkircher Liedertafel" schon seit Jahren durch ihre Tüchtigkeit sich eine hervorragende Stellung unter den Gesangvereinen erworben hat und ihre Aufführungen stets dem wohlverdienten Beifall sicher sind, so hat der am 13. d. M. von derselben veranstaltete Sängerabend alle Erwartungen weit überliefert. Sämtliche Nummern des auserlesenen Programms wurden mit außergewöhnlicher Präcision und Sicherheit, mit Wärme und Verständnis ausgeführt und es war nur eine Stimme des Lobes und der Anerkennung, mit dem anwesenden Publikum, welches, angeregt durch die vorzüglichen Darbietungen, in bester Stimmung war und derselben milenter durch stürmischen Beifall lauten Ausdruck gab. Aus den einzelnen Nummern übergehend, sind wir in Verlegenheit, welcher wir den Vorrang zuzusprechen sollen. Wenn wir das hinreißende Spiel der viel über unser Heimatland hinaus gekannten und gewürdigten Collovini, Herr Chorleiter PH. Schmutzer, bewundern, der seine schwierige Aufgabe mit staunenswerther Kunstfertigkeit löst und einen wahren Sturm von Beifall erzielte, weln wir der Herr Costenzer und Hagg, welche die zwei Duette: „Sonntagsseiler" v. Spohr und „Frühlings-Wiederkehr" v. Reißinger glänzend zur Geltung brachten, erwähnen so können wir nicht unterlassen, der beiden Chöre „Maiennacht" v. Abt und „Ständchen" mit Tenorsolo v. Nicht den letzten Platz in der Reihe nimmt das Volkstheater „der Vorwurf" von Schulz - Weida ein, dessen zarte, innige Weise mit richtigem Verständnis vorgetragen, zum Herzen des Hörers drang. Die Walzer „Wein, Weib und Gesang" von Johann Strauß, von der Liedertafel schwungvoll und mit Feuer gesungen, wirkte auf die erregte Tanzlust in solchem Grade, daß man sofort daran ging, den Saal zu räumen, und sich dann bis nach Mitternacht dem Tanzvergnügen hingab. Dieser Sängerabend wird jedem Theilnehmer in freundlicher Erinnerung bleiben, die Liedertafel aber darf sich zu demselben gratulieren, denn sie hat sich ein neues Blatt in ihre Ruhmeskränze eingefügt, das dem tüchtigen Chormeister derselben, Herrn Dr. Dessel, die größte Ehre gereicht. An die Verlassungsgesellschaften in Feldkirch und Umgebung. Nachdem die Versammlung des Vereins der Verfassungsfreunde am 21. Dez. 1869 die Zweckmäßigkeit, ja Notwendigkeit von liberalen Lokalvereinen ausgesprochen hat, so werden die Herren Mitglieder des Vereins der Verfassungsfreunde aus Feldkirch und der Umgebung eingeladen, Samstag den 25. d. M. abends 8 Uhr im Saal zum Ochsen zu erscheinen, um sich über die Gründung eines solchen Vereins zu besprechen. Es braucht wohl kaum gesagt zu werden, dass jeder liberale, der Verfassung anhängliche Bürger herzlich willkommen gegeben wird, und ist eine um so zahlreichere Beteiligung zu erwarten, als bei den äußerst geringen Kosten, die einem solchen Verein zufallen, voraussichtlich von der Einhebung einer Geldbeilage ganz abgesehen werden kann. Also nicht gesämt, wo es gilt, die Sache der Freiheit und des liberalen Bürgertums zu fördern. Wir ersuchen auch, Kommentare wegen verspäteter oder unregelmäßiger Zusendung der Zeitung uns sofort mittels offener unfranzösischer Schreiben mit der Aufschrift "Zeitungs- Kommentar" anzuzeigen. Zugleich bemerken wir, dass Nr. 1 und 2 bereits vergriffen sind und neue eingetretene Abonnenten nicht mehr nachgeliefert werden können. Die Redaktion. Der ergebenst Unterzeichnete beehrt sich anzuzuzeigen, dass er während der Faschingszeit sich hier im Gasthaus „zum Bären" aufhalten werde und sich den Herrn Gastgebern sowie verehrten Privatgesellschaften mit einer wohlbesetzten, tatfesten Streichmusik, bestehend aus 5 Personen, zu Bällen, Kränzchen oder sonstigen Unterhaltungen. Besonders macht er darauf aufmerksam, dass er sowohl Quadrillen, als auch die neuesten Walzer und Polkas in großer Auswahl aufzuführen in der Lage ist. Hochachtungs voll Josef Ripper samt Gesellschaft gegenwärtig im „Bären" in Feldkirch. 6. Mann, der schon mehrere Jahre in größeren Fabrikgeschäften als Comptoirist tätig war, der eins, und dopp.

Article: Zahlreich sind die Ströme, welche dem Ti|i!Tiö von beiden Sei- ten ziifliessen, wir können von ilinen nur die wichtigeren an- geben. Aus den Qarajabergen kommt der Devc gecid, der ost- wärts zum Tigris eilt und dessen rechtes Ufer erreicht. \an der linken Seite kommt der KaCman-su, an einem Neben- Hiisae desselben liegt die Stadt Maiafarcqlu, die alte Martyro- polia , in deren Nähe wahrscheinlich auch die alte Tigrano- eerta lag, obwol die Stelle noch nicht genau nachgewiesen ist 'j . Weiterhin mündet der Pluss von Kitlis , der sieb mit ilem von Sert geeinigt hat und- dessen aus den Gebirgen kom- mender Lauf noch nicht in allen Theilen erforscht ist. Am Tigris seihst sind an dieser Strecke seines Laufes nur Hisn Keif zu nennen und weiterhin Jesiret ibn Omar, das alte Kezabde. Der vollständige Name der Stadt ist Jeztret abd-ul azfz ibn omar, weil Abd-ul Aziz der Sohn Omars, de& !4. Chalifen der Omniayadendynastie nie erbaut haben soU^i. Den Namen Jeztre (Insel: hat nie daher erhalten, dass sie den Moyet SaqlfLn an der einen Seite, auf der andern den Tigris hat und diese beiden Flüsse im Februar und März den Hü- gel, auf welchem sie gebaut ist, in der Weise umgeben, dass er in Wirklichkeit zur Insel «-ird. Auch in ihr giebt es eine nicht unbedeutende Anzahl von ('bristen. Unterhalb Jezlra kommt aus dem Seitenthale Zakho der Khabär und mündet auf der linken Seite in den Tigris. Dieser Fluss von Zakfao ist nur ein kleiner Bach , bis er den weit betleutenderen Ha- zer-su in sich aufnimmt, der ihn zu einem Strome anschwellt. Weiterhin finden wir am Tigris das nexicre Mosul und das ältere Ninive, erstere Stadt liegt auf der rechten, die letztere auf der linken Seite des Tigris. Die Stadt Mosul scheint sehr neu und kommt erst in den Zeiten des Tsläm vor, aber Niuive mit seinen Palästen war schon zerstört als Xenophoii an ihnen vorüber zog und es scheint darum wahrscheinlich, dass die .\u8iedelungen an diesem Orte den Niinica Ninive behielten bis in die Zeit des Islam.

Uabei muss mau bedenken , dass die Wichtigkeit der Strasse über Ninive im Alterthume eine viel bedeutendere war als g^enwärtig, wo sich durch die Unsidierheit der Wege ein groHter Theil des Handels nach Abäshehr gezogen hat, es ist aber immerhin mißlich, dass Mosul später seine alte Bedeutung wieder erlangen könnte, wenn die gegenwärtigen MissstäiiJe beseitigt sein werden. Von MoBul abwärts sind uns die Ufer des Tigris ^v()lll bekannt. Uer Strom wendet sich gegen Süden. Das I^nd zu beiden Seiten des Flusses ist fruchtbar und grün, daher auch reichlich mit Dörfern besetzt, zwischen ihnen liegen die Ruinen assyrischer Städte, welche mit Mosul binnen und zwar bi^ finden sich die Ruinen von Ninive und weiter stn)niabwärtB die von Nimriid auf dem linken Ufer des Flusses, die von Uala Sherghat dagegen auf dem rechten. Die bedeutenden Zuflüsse, welche der Tigris iu diesem Theile seines Laufes aufnimmt, kommen fast alle von der linken Seite aus <len iranischen Gebilden imd sind uns schon aus der früheren Be- schreibung jener I^änder bekannt. Abgesehen von kleineren Bächen ist es der grosse '/Ah, welcher bei dem neueren Orte Keshaf seine blauen wild tobenden Gewässer mit den schmutzig gelben Wogen des Tigris veriiinigt.

Mündung des groesttn Zäb in der Nähe der Ruinen von Nim- röd, so liegt die des kleinen Zäb in der Nähe der Kuinen von Qala Sherghat. Diese Mündung hat nur eine Breite vtm 25 F., während der Tigris an der Stelle, wo der kleine Zäh mündet, wohl 500 Schritte breit ist. Auch in der Nähe von QaU Sherghat ist wieder von einem Hache die Rede, der aus den Sinjärbergen kommen und auf dem rechten Ufer des Tigris münden soll, doch ist die Sache noch nicht ganz klar. Der einzige neuere Ort von Bedeutung, welcher zwischen Moaul und Baghdäd li^, ist die Stadt Tekrlt am rechten Ufer des TigriB. Gegenwärtig ist die Stadt nur klein, früher aber war sie bedeutender. Noch sieht man dort Ruinen eines früheren Schlusses und zahlreiche Trümmer von Moscheen und Häusern aus der Blütezeit der arabischen Herrschaft'). Unterhalb Te- knt b^innt das ebene T^and und der Strom breitet sich dess- halb weiter aus, auch beginnen jetzt auf der rechten Seite die Canäle, welche den Tigris mit dem Euphrat verbinden. Bis zur Mündung des Adhem bleibt das Ostufei steinig, dann geht es in Alluvialboden über, so dass der Strom in einer voll- kommenen Ebene dahinzieht. Zahlreiche Ruinen, zum Theil aus vormuhammedaniseher Zeit, bedecken auch auf dieser Strecke seine Ufer, namentlich auf der Ostseite. In der Nähe von Baghdäd erreicht die Annäherung des Tigris an den Euphrat ihre höchste Höhe. Die Chalifenstadt Baghdäd ist neueren Ursprungs und berührt uns «tarum hier nicht weiter. Es genüge zu sagen, dass das Clima gesund und dass die Ebene, in wel- cher die Stadt liegt, nur selten ansteckenden Krankheiten unterworfen ist. Das Wasser des Tigris ist zum Trinken sehr wohl gee^pet und eine bessere Benutzung der Canäle müsste das r.and weithin sehr fruchtbar machen. Die Gegensätze des Climas theilt Baghdäd mit anderen Orten Mesopotamiens: die Hitze steigt im Sommer bis zu 3ö Gr.

Dieee Eigenthümlichkeiten der Stadt Kaghdid und ihrer Umgebung theilen auch die alten Städte Ktesiphou and Seleucia, welche nicht sehr weit von ihr entfernt liegen. In kleiner Entfernung stromabwärtB bezeichnen Ruinenhügel die ehemalige Stadt Ktesiphon auf dem linken und ihr gegen^ aber Setencia auf dem rechten Ufer des Tigris. Aber nur Ktesiphon weist in dem sogenannten Palaste des Khosru (Täq-i- Keera) ein Baudenkmal von einiger Bedeutung auf, die Ruinen Ton Seleucia, obwol ziemlich ausgedelint, scheinen nichts Merk- würdiges zu enthalten, doch sind sie kaum noch genau genug untersucht. Unterhalb Ktesiphon wendet sich der Tigris wieder mehr g^en Osten, wodurch die Breite der mesopotamischen Ebene zunimmt, diese Ostwendung hält an bis nach Kut el Ammära. Von Ktesiphon an zeigt sich auch wenig Anbau mehr am Ufer, die Ansiedelungen werden spärhcb, aber das Tamariskengebüsch und die Kriechpflanzen am Ufer sind fast undurchdringbar. Kut el Ammära liegt im geraden Abstände 97'/i engl. M, von B^hdäd, die vielen Krümmungen ver- grossem den Weg auf dem Flusse um nicht wen^er als S1 engl. M., SU dass die Entfernung auf dem Flusse 178 engl. M^len beträgt. Von Kut el Ammära an beginnt der grosse Wechsel, dass der Tigris, statt durch die Canäle Zuwachs aus dem Euphrat zu erhalten, wie dies auf seinem bisherigen Laufe der Fall war, nun vielmehr von seiner Wassermasse an den Guphrat abgiebt. Mit dieser Zuführung, des Tigriswassers in den Euphrat macht der grosse Caiial Shatt ul Hai den Anfang, an ihm liegt die im Mittelalter bedeutende Stadt Wäsith, g^enwärtig in Ruinen. Bei Kut el Ammira beginnt auch das persische Gebüge sichtbar zu werden, das rechte Ufer ist flach und ohne alle Abwechslung. Unterhalb der Einmündung des Nahreväncanals bei Imäm Gharbl wendet sich der Lauf des Tigris gegen Süden und die von den Bergen im Osten abflies- senden Gewässer verwandeln die Landschaft im Osten des Flusses in eine Sumpfgegend, nicht viel anders ist es auch auf dem rechten Ufer, hier durch vemachlSssigte Canäle. So weit das Auge reicht ist Alles eine einförmige traurige SfiiEel.erta. lltaittBiaikude. 12 ■zec.y Google 17d Eritei Buch: Oeogrtphie- VI. Anneuien.

Etwa eine Stunde oberhalb Qoma beginnen die Dattelhaine nnd bei Qoma mündet der Tigris selbst in starker Strömung in den Euphrat ein, mit welchem er fortan nur einen einzigen Pluss bildet. 6. Der Shatt ul Arab. Jeder der beiden grossen Strome, welche sich bei Uoma vereinigen, ist an 300 Schritte breit und nachdem sie sich lu einem einzigen Strome gesammelt haben , erhält dieser einen Wasaerspi^el von etwa 600 Schritte Breite uuil einer anhalttm- den Tiefe von etwa 20 Fuss, welche er bis zu der gegen &<i Stunden entfernten Mündung in das Meer beibeluilt. Noch lange ifit das wüdreiasende trübe Wasser des Tigris von dem weisslichen Euphratwasser zu unterscheiden, aber die Namen Euphrat und Tigris verschwinden, es kennt sie niemand mehr im I>unde und der vereinigte Strom führt überall den Gesammt- namen Shatt ul Arab. Der directe Abstand Qomas von Kasra iet IT Stunden und die Fahrt dahin geht ohne Schwierigkeit von Statten. Zwei Stunden unterhalb Qoma vereinigt sich mit dem Shatt ul Arab auch noch der Hauptarm des Kerkha und unterhalb Hasca tritt bei Mobammera schon ganz in der Nähe der Mündung auch noch der Hafararm des Kardn hinzu, nur etwa 10 Stunden unterhalb Ba«ra. Bis nach Basra Sieaat der Strom durch herrliches (Kulturland und seine Ufer sind mit den schönsten Uattelwaldungou bedeckt, vor seinem Ausgange in die See bildet er mehrere Deltas und die Ufer werden eine wüste braungebrannte Ebene. Von wie grosser Bedeutung dieser mächtige Strom für den Handel sei, da ihn nach seiner Yereinigung selbst die grössteu Kri^^schiffe befahren können, bedarf keiner weitem Bemerkung und erhellt selbst noch aus dem heutigen Verkehre, obwol dieser nur ein schwaches Bild des Treibeub guben kann, welches im Alterthume an diesen Ufern geherrscht haben muss, als Niuive und Babylon noch ,zec.yGüOg[f 7.

Sie bilden die Wasserscheide für den Euphrat gegen Westen, deuu nur die von ihrem Ostrande ablaufenden Uewässer führen sie diesem Strome zu, während die Wasser iler Westseite ihren Weg in das Mittelmeer finden. Nach der (Gestaltung der Entrinde zu ttchliessen, hätten wir hier die west- liche Gränze Armeniens und Eiäns erreicht, denn jenseits dieser Berge finden wir ein gei^raphisch vollkommen neues Gebiet: die kleinasiatische Gliederung ') . Allein gec^raphische Rück- üichten dürfen uns hier nicht auKschltesslich bestimmen, <lenD sowohl in ethnographischer alc politischer Hinsicht sind die Eränier noch weiter gegen Westen vorgedrungen und wir sind daher genöthigt, auch lüe Flussläufe auf der westlichen Seite dieser Gebirge zu verfolgen und das an ihnen liegende Land lu hetracliten. \'orübergehend haben wir bereits dieses Gebiet betreten , als wir oben den (!orokh als die nördliche Gränze .Armeniens betrachteten. Die Flüsse, welche nun ausserdem noch zu betrachten wären , sind der Je:jhil Irmaq und der Uizil Irmaq. Diese beiden münden in das schwarze Meer. Die VVssserscheidehöhen dieser drei Stromgebiete grauzen an ein- ssder in dem Khanzlr-dägh, der unter 39 Gr. n. Br. und M ö.

Seine Quellen liegen auf dem Cämly-däglk (Fichtenberg) , der an 5000 F. hoch und unter dem 40. Gr. n. Br. nur etwa 16 geugr. M. vom Meere entfernt ist. Seine Quelle ist mit Gewissheit noch nicht entdeckt, li^t aber keinenfalb weit von der Quelle des Halys uitferut, sein oberer Lauf, ehe er in die Ebene eintritt, ist gleichfalls wenig bekannt; am diesem fiihrt er den Namen Tuzanly-su. Die Gegend am oberen .Laufe des Flusses ist rauh und nur selten trifft man in ihr auf Dörfer, die nach armeni- scher Art unter der Erde gebaut sind; der ganze Landstrich ist sehr dnnn bevölkert. Erst von Tokät an beginnt er uns besser bekannt zu werden. Diese Stadt liegt etwa 1600 F. Qber dem Meere, befindet sich aber bereits in der Ebene, in einem schönen Thale voller Landsitze und Gärten. Sie ist gross und bedeutend durch ihren Handel mit Erzeräm, wohin Caravanen in 16 Tagen gelangen können, aber eine alte Stadt ist sie nicht, sie ist erst in der christlichen Zeit nachweisbar. Jedoch in ihrer nächsten Nälie liegt Gümenek, das (^mana Pontica der Alten, woselbst ein berühmter Tempel der Anaids gelegen war, dem die ganze Umgegend gehörte, an dessen Spitze ein Oberpriester stand, welcher mit Ausschluss des Rechtes über Leben und Tod zu verfügen hatte. Bei dem Tempel lebten an 6000 Hierodulen und der Cultus der Anaitis in sehr lasciver Form wurde noch unter der Herrschaft der Römer geübt und verschwindet erst in der christlichen Zeit. Alter- thiimer hat indesa Giimenek ausser einigen Krückenresten aus der iranischen Zeit keine mehr aufzuweisen und ohne die genauen Angaben Strabos würden wir Mühe haben, die I'age des Ortes aufzufinden. — Von Tokät aus fliesst der Iris eine Strecke von 8 Stunden g^en Westen, durch eine Ebene, welche die Alten Daximonitis nannten, die aber bei den Neueren Qäz-ovä [Cränscebeue] heisst. Weinberge, welche einen guten Wein liefern, bedecken die Berge an der Seite der Ebene. Weiterhin engen die Herge von Turkhal den Fluss mehr ein und in der Nälie des jetzigen Städtchens Turkhal muss eine weitere pontische Königsstadt, Gaziura, gelten haben. Eine halbe Tagereise westwärts von derselben Stadt liegt Zela, heut- tizec „Google 7. Die weRtlichen Grftntea. ISl zutage Zilleh genannt, gleichfalls der Sitz änen alt«n Tempels der Anaitis, welchem das umli^ende Land zu eigen war; auch hier stand an der Spitze des Tempelgcbietes ein Priester. Nachdem der Ina aus der Verengung herausgetreten ist, welche ihm die Beige von Turkhal bereiten, tritt er in eine Ebene ein, die jedoch an ihrem £nde wieder von Bergen geschlossen vird, deren Engpässe der Strom durchbrechen muss, gerade in dieser neaeii Verengung li^ die Stadt A.maeia, über welche lieh Kalksteinrosssen von über 1000 P. Höhe emporthürmen. Ehe indesG der Iris die Stadt Amasia nocik erreicht, nimmt er auf seiner linken Seite zwei Zuflüsse auf, deren erster Tschykryk-su genannt wird und dessen Quelle nur fünf Stunden von Tokät am Westabhange des Cämly-dügh liegen soll. Ueber seine Quelle ist nichts Näheres bekannt, wir wissen aber, dass er anfangs seinen Lauf gegen Südwesten nebtet, 8 Stunden später aber bei Sulu Serii sich plötzlich nach Norden und Nordwesten wendet und fünf Stunden oberhalb Amasia auf einer Höhe von 1384 F. über dem Meere in den Iris fallt. Der eweite linke ZufluRs ist der Tschötürlü-su, der sich dicht neben dem Tschy- kryk-su in den Iris ei^esst. Die verschiedenen Bäche, aus denen dieser Fluss entsteht, sind in ihrem Laufe noch nicht genau untersucht, er scheint der Srylax der Alten zu sein. An einer seiner Quelläüsse li^t <\ie Stadt Ts<rh«rum am Ost- abhänge des KÖse-dikgh (Eckbeigl, kaum eine halbe Tage- rrise von der Wasserscheide des Iris und Halys entfernt ; nahe bei ibr hat man ein altes Grab entdeckt, das bis in die Zeiten «ler persischen Herrschaft zurückzugehen scheint. Nur wenige Stunden unterhalb der Mündung des Tschötürlü-su liegt die fitadt Amasia in einem reizenden Thalkessel. Sie hat einträg- liche Gärten und Maulbeerpflanzungen, besonders aber ist sie ein Stapelort grosser Seiden vorräthe. Im Alterthume kennen wir sie als den Geburtsort Strabos, doch wird sie zuerst von Pbnius [H. N. VI, 3, 4) und Ptolemäua (V, 61 erwähnt. Gleich- wohl ist nicht daran zu zweifeln, daas die Stadt iilt ist, Pet- ^engraber, die man auf dem Berge gefunden hat, welcher die- ^Ibe Überrest, sind längst wegen ihrer Aehnlichkeit mit den Giabern bei PeiEepolis aufgefallen und rühren wahrscheinlich aus einer älteren Zeit her als die der pontischen Könige, aus izec.y Google ]g2 Entee Buoh: Geographie. VI. Anneoien. der Zeit der persUchcn Satrapen *). — Eine kurze Strecke unter- halb Ämafiia erhält der Irin einen neuen ZuflusB, welcher der Pluss von Tcrschan, auch Suaacamlii-su genannt wird. Auch er entsteht nicht blos aus einer einzigen Quelle, sondern aus mehreren, eine derselben entspringt aus dem See Ladik und flieBSt aus dem nördlichen Ende hervor, von wo sie sich in einem Halbkreise gegen Westen und Süden wendet. Den be- deutendsten Zufluss erhält aber der Mr auf seiner rechten Seite. Er nimmt denselben etwa tli — 18 Stunden unterhalb Amasia in sich auf und nimmt durch ihn an Umfang bedeutend zu, vorher ist er nicht über 75 — 90 F. breit und selten mehr als 3 Fuss tief. Dieser grösste Zuflut<s ist der Lycus der Alten, er ergiesst sich bei Suniea in denselben , in der Landschaft, welche Strabo Phaneroea nennt. Der Lycus oder Germeili-cii kommt weit vom Osten her und seine Quelle ist noch nicht ganz genau erforscht, wir wissen blos, dass sie innerhalb der Höhenzuge liegt, in die man im Nordwesten von Erzing^ gelangt, in der 'Sähe, eines armenischen Ortee Satagh, in dem Kiepert mit grosser Wahrsclieinlichkeit das alte Satala wieder erkannt hat. Auch der Lauf von der Quelle bis Qarä Hisär, der etwa 10 — 12 Stunden in Anspruch nimmt, ist noch nicht genau aufgeklärt, besser ist das Thal abwärts bis Niksär be- kannt, der Name dieses Ortes ist aus Neocaesarea entstanden. Es gehört dieses Flussthal zu den wohlhabenderen in Klein- asien, da es noch nicht von den Verheerungen der Kurden heimgesucht worden ist, die sich mehr südlich halten. Altern thümer hat man jedoch in diesem Thale nicht gefunden, ebenso wenig sind noch Spuren von der Stadt Magnopolis zu ent- decken, welche in der Nähe des Zusammenflusses des Iris imd Lycus gelegen haben muss. Nachdem sich der fris mit dem Lycus vereinigt hat, durchbricht der Gcsammtstrom das Gebirge, um in die Ebene von Themiscyra einzutreten, wo er dann durch fruchtbare Gegenden dem schwarzen Meere zueih. Nur im Vorübergehen kann hier eines kleinen Flusses gedacht werden, wdcher östlich vom Iris sich in das schwarze Meer ergieest : es ist der Therraodon der Alten, der in seinem heutigen Namen Terme-su noch Spuren des früheren erhalten 1] Die Belege a. m. hei Kitler XVin, 172. „,, _,..,y Google 7.

Für das Alter* tbum hatte er eine Kedeutunf^, denn da seine Mündung nur 10 Meilen von der Mündung des Irie und dieser wieder nur 14 Meilen von der Mündung des Halys entfernt ist, so bilde- ten diese drei Strome eine natürliche dreifache Vemchanzung g^en die von Osten kommenden Angriffe. Zudem knüpfl sich an diesen Fluss und an die Ebenen zu seiner ijeitc die Stge von den Amazonen an. , Mit dem Qixil Irmaq oder Ilalys ') «ind wir an der äusiter- sten Gränze des iranischen Reiches angekommen. Dieser Fluss tnldete, wie uns schon Herodot berichtet (i, 72], die Gränze zwischen dem medischeu und lydischcn Reiche, und auch in späterer Zeit hat er noch diesen volkerscheidenden Charakter beibehtdten , den er erst seit dem Auftauchen der Türkenherr- sehaft veiioren hat. Diese Eigenschaft ist e«, welche den Halys bedeutend macht, denn sonst hat dichter Strom nichts was ihm Anfimerksamkeit verschaffen könnte. Der Halys ist kein mäch- tiger Strom wie der Euphrat und Tigris, sondern wasserarm und nicht schiffbar. Seinen Lauf von der Quelle bis zum Meere kann man mit Eioschluss der Krümmungen auf löO geogr. M. anschlagen, so daes er die I^nge des Rheines ziem- lich erreicht. Allein da die Bei^e, denen er Meinen Ursprung verdankt, sich nicht über 4000 F. erheben ^nd mithin die gewaltigen ächneemassen der Hochgebii|je fehlen, welche die Flnsee Armeniens nähren, da ebenso die kaukasischen und pontischeu Nebel nicht soweit vordringen, i« eiche dem ost- lichen armenischen Taurus reichliclies Wasser zufuhren und den Corukb bilden helfen, so kann die WassermaMSe des tialys niidit sehr bedeutend sein.

Die Quelle des Flusses liegt 6200 F. über dem Meere, die Gegend ist rauh, die Wintei lange und svhneereich, die Summer zwar kurz aber heiss, da- rum gedeiht auch in den Thäleru Weizen und Geret«; die Hauptbesclütftigung der EinTrohuer, die meistens Armenier sind, bildet die Viehzucht und Mästung von Schlachtvieh, das auf den iicrgen seine Nahrung findet. Die Wohnungen liegen hier noch, wie in Armenien, groasentbeils unter der Erde. Nicht lange hält sieh indess der Halys auf solcher Höhe, bei dem nur 5 Stunden von seinem Ursprünge entfernten Doife Zara fliesst er nur noch 4204 F. über dem Meere, von da an fangt die türkische Bevölkerung an zahlreicher zu werden und überwiegt die armenische. Noch, ehe der Fluss Zara erreicht münden mehrere Hache in denselben, seinen ersten bedeuten- den ZuflusB erhalt er aber sechs Stunden unterhalb Zara auf seiner linken Seite. In der Ebene von Siwis {38S0 F. übet dem Meere) ist sein Lauf reissend, der Fluss macht grosse Krümmungen und ist daher voller Inseln und Sandbänke. Siwis, d. i, Sebaste wird zuerst von Plinius (H. N. VI, 3) genannt und ist keine sehr alte Stadt, in deren Nfthe sich Salzquellen und Steinsalz finden. Die Einwohnerzahl soll sich auf 5000 türkische und 1300 armenische Familien belaufen. Der Weg den der Halys von Stwäs abwärts bis zur Mündung des Melas zu durchlaufen hat betragt 30 geogr. Meilen und bis zu seiner Nordweudung bei Yäräpasön noch 7 geogr M. mehr, so dass der Fluss bis zu dem zuletzt genannten Orte, wenn man die Krümmungen mit einrechnet, an 40 geogr. M. zu- rücklegen dürfte. Diese ganze Strecke ist einförmig, unfrucht- bar und daher auch mensclienann, selbst von den Keiseuden nur wenig b^angen, da dorthin keine Hauptstrasse fuhrt. Von den kleinen Flüssen, welche dem Halys auf dieser Strecke zufliessen, ist der Melas oder Sarym s4qlü-su {jjajiäiM^.Lad. i. Knoblauch Wasser) der westlichste. Dieser fliesst am Südufei des Halys in einer Entfernung von nur wenigen Stunden IS — 20 Stunden lang mit dem Hauptflusse parallel g^en Süd- westen, wendet sich aber dann, nachdem er einen andern Ge- ;,zec.y Google 7. Die weBtlichen OrftnieD. 185 biigsbach, den QanLsu, aufgenommen hat, bei Sazlyq nurd- wärte zum Halysthale, ehe et diesen erreicht vereinigen sich mit ihm noch viele Quellen und Bäche die vom Argaeue kom- men. Dieser Berg sowie die in Heiner Nähe gelegene Stadt Caesarea 'j U^en von den Ufern des HiJys nicht weit entfernt. Der Argaeus (Arjish dägh) ist ein Bei^ der seine Erhebung vtilkanischen Einflüssen verdankt, ähnlich wie der Demävend oder Ararat, er erhebt sich bis 13000 F. absolut über das Meer oder 9 — tOOOO P. über das ihn umgebende Plateau, das von vulkanischen Eiuflüssen noch sattsame Spuren zeigt. Aucli der mittlere Lauf des Halys in einer Länge von 55 — 60 M. und vielen Krümmungen ist uns nur sehr unvollständig und besonders nur an den Orten bekannt, wo Strassen denselben durchsetzen. Die Gegend au seinen Ufern ist unfruchtbar weil sie wassetlos ist und man den Halys wegen seines Salz- gehaltes für ungeeignet zur Bewässerung der Felder hält. Die Bevölkerung ist demnach auch stromabwärt« vun C'äsarea nur unbedeutend , man sieht meist nur die Zelte umherziehender Nomaden. Das Wasser des Flusses ist trübe und schmutzig, es steigt im April durch die Schneeschmelze und dann ist der Flufls nur mit Gefahr zu durchsetzen , das Wasser fällt aber im Juni und bleibt dann niedrig bis zum Ortober, wti es durch die in den Gebirgen fallenden Regen von Neuem ansteigt. Bei Cäsarea hat der Halys eine Breite von nur 60 Fuss, aber nach der Mündung des Flusses von Kirshehr erweitert sich das Bett desselben bis auf 120 F., an einzelnen Stellen sogar bis auf 200 Schritte ; später verengert sich dasselbe wieder durch Felsen, welche an das Flussufer treten und bei Osmän- jyq ist die Brette nur 70 Schritte, weil die Felsen die Ebene am Ufer ganz verdrängt haben. Die iiit^ht sehr bedeutenden Zuflüsse des Halys auf der linken Seite sind nicht einmal alle dem Namen nach festgestellt, als einer der wichtigem mag der Akajyq-su genannt werden, der aus dem Akajyr]-dägh ent- I) Ueber die Stadt C&sarea cf. 6t Martin I, INä flg.

Uiese Höhlen setzen sich theilweise auch noch jenseits des Flusses auf dem rechten Ufer fort. Auf die- sem rechten tifer des Halyf sind wir etwas besser bewandert als auf dem linken, da auf diesem die Hauptstrasae von Cäsa- rea nach Angora führt. .Der W^ führt zum Tlieil durch fruchtbare Gegenden , als solche wird namentlich die Umge- gend von Kirshehr hervorgehoben und dieser Ort würde durch Fleis- lind Aufinerksamkeit meiner Bewohner eine ganz andere Bedeutung erlangen können als er gegenwärtig hat. Die Höhen, welche sich in nicht weiter Entfernung vom rechten Ufer des Halys erheben, scheinen auch seine Wasserscheide gc^en sei- nen Nebenfluss an dieser Seite zu sein , den bedeutendsten den er überhaupt empfängt. Dieser Nebenfluss ist der Dehje- SU , der nicht weit vom Nordufer des Halys bei Horan ent- springt, ;iM7 F. über dem Meere und nach einem Laufe von 60 Stunden in den -HauptHuss mündet; sein Lauf ist mit dem des Hauptflusses parallel. Auch der Delije-su hat mehrere Nebenflüsse, unter denen der Konok-su der bedeutendste ist; dieser entspringt im Norden von Slwäs unweit der Halysquel- len und legt eine (Strecke von 40 Stunden zurück, che er sich mit dem Delije-su vereinigt. Am bekanntesten ist aber der nördliche NehenfluBS, der kleine Delije (Rücük Delije) genannt, auch der Strom von Izygat, weil an ihm die bedeutende Stadt Izygat liegt. Drei Stunden nordwestlich von dieser gelangt man zu dem Dorfe Nefesköi mit Inschriften und Altertilümeni aus der Zeit der Kyeantiner, und nur vier Stunden von da, gegen Nordwesten, sind die berühmten Denkmale von Kt^haz- köi, die zu den wenigen in Kleinaaien gehören, welche aus sehr alter Zeit stammen und von weh itun wir später ausführ- lich reden werden.

Der untere !>auf des Halys von Osmänyjq an bis^' zum Meere ist noch nicht genau erforscht worden, obwol derselbe mancherlei Interesse bieten würde. Durch die Kette des Tan- shan-dägh (ob ^JJiyh^ Hasenberg) welche von Osten uach We- sten streichend dem Ufer des Fhisses sich nähert, wird dieser gezwungen sich auf einer Strecke von t4 — 15 Stunden gegen Westen zu wenden , kehrt aber hei Dauran und Wezir-kÖpri wieder in seine normale Richtung zurück. im geraden Ab- stände von Osmilnjyq würde die Entfernung vom Meere nur noch etwa 3.S Stunden betragen , durch den Ht^en den der Halys gegen Westen zu machen gezwungen ist, wird diese Entfernung auf 50 Stunden erweitert. Die Zuflüsse des Halys auf der rechten Seite sind auf dieser Strecke unbedeutend, aber auf seiner linken Seite erhält er zwei nicht unbedeutende Zuflüsse. Der eine ist der Dowrek cäi'}, welcher am Ende eines 30 Stunden langen Thaies ents))ringt, wolohe^ vom Halys aus bia zum Ursprung de« Flusses ohne bedeutende Krüm- moi^en sich erstreckt und fruchtbar und gut angebaut ist.

Wir haben in den vorigen Capiteln die verschiedenen Län- derstrecken kennen gelernt, die man unter dem Namen Er4n in weiterem Sinne zu8ammenfa»sen muss, wie sie nich nach ihrer naturlichen Beschaffenheit darstellen ; nicht ohne Interesse ist es auch, die Eintheilungen zu kennen, welche die alten Be- wohner in ihrem Lande machten. Ehe wir uue aber diesen Eintheilui^en zuwenden , wird es passend sein , zuerst mit einigen Worten der Anschauung zu gedenken, welche sich die alten Bewohner Erins von der sie umgebenden Welt im All- gemeinen gebildet hatten. Ueber sich glaubten die Erinier nicht einen, sondern zwei Himmel zu haben, von welchen der innere (&smiu) als ein Wall von blauen durchsichtigen Steinen gedacht wurde, welcher aufgeworfen war, um die bösen Gei- ster vom Eindringen in die gute Geisterwett abzuhalten. Ein- geschlossen wurde dieser so wie die übrige Welt von dem jür &dl!UHde I, 42.1) ist llkis-il4gh lu achieiben Uie eine wie die andere Form i"t wol Entstellung den alten Namens.

Wir werden von diesen beiden Wesen, welche wichtige mytholo- gische Beziehui^D haben, später ausführlicher rcdeu müssen, wenn wir die mythologiachen Vorstellungen der ErjUiier be- handeln. Nach spateren Mittheilungen ist die Krde dem Kie eines Vogels zu Teigleichen, in der Art nämlich, dass die bei- den Schalen des Eis den äussern Himmel, der Dotter aber die Hrde vorstellt. Es ist sehr m<^lich, dass diese Vorstellung schon in die alt« Zeit zurückgeht, da wir sie auch bei andern al(«n Völkern wieder vorfinden. Die Erde selbst nun wird von den Eriniem wieder bald in drei'), bald in sieben Ab- theilungen oder Kareshvares gctheilt, nicht Mos insofern als die Erde seihst öfter die aus sieben Kareshvares bestehende genannt wird^i, es werden auch die Namen derselben an meh- rereo Stellen aufgezäldt'), dieselben lauten: Arczahe, ^avahd, Fradadhafshu , Vldadhofshu , Vöuru-barsti , VAuru-jarsti und Qaniratha. Eine befriedigende Erklärung aller ilieser Namen aus den iranischen Sprachen giebt es bis jetzt nicht, nament- lich klingen die ersteren Namen ziemlich un^ränisch. Auffal- lend wird es jedem Leser des Avesta sein, dass das letzt« die- ser Kareshvare gewöhnlich durch das Beiwort imat, dieses, au^ezeichnet wird (so ist auch Vd. 19, 129 zu lesen], wäh- rend den übrigen Namen entweder gar kein Wort beigefügt oder das Pronomen ava), jenes, gewählt wird. Den Aufschluss über diese Sitte giebt uns der Hundehcsh, welcher sich übei die Lehre von den Kareshvares weiter verbreitet \v. Ti. 7.). Wir sehen aus den Mittheil iingen dieses Kuches, dass eigent- lich nur Uoniratha unserer Erde entspricht, die übrigen Karesh- I) Cf- Vd. 2, 37; Y?. 11, 21; Yt, n, S.

B. e. II.), die ganze Erde mit Wasser zu überschwemmen, damit die vuu Agtü - mainyuti geschaffenen schädlichen Thiere vertilgt würden, da brach die Erde in sieben Stücke auseinander, Qaniratha als das grösste dieser Stucke blieb in der Mitte, westlich von ihm liegt Arezahd, ostlich ^vahä, im Norden Vdui-u-barsti und Vöuni-jarsti , im Süden Fradadhafshu und Vidadhafshu. Wie das grosste, so ist Qaniratha auch daa voi^ züghchste unter allen Kareshvares, der Kampf zwischen Agrö- mainyuE und den guten Oenien wird besonders da ausgefoch- ten , mit den Bewohnern der übrigen Kareshvares bestehen natürlich keine Beziehungen, da man auf natürliche Art nicht mit ihnen verkehren kann, die Wesen daselbst scheinen auch ganz andrer Art zu sein als in Qaniratha, das Gesetz ist zwar auch in den übrigen Kareshvares verbreitet worden , aber auf übeniatär liehe Weise, nicht durch Menschen. Kurz, die Vor- stellungen von den Bewohnern der übrigen Kareshvares sind durchaus nebelhaft, auch greifen diese nirgends in den Gang der Welt ein, so dass wir vollkommen berechtigt sind une auf Qaniratha allein zu bescliränken, wenn wir von den Zustän- den dieser Welt reden. Um nun eine Vorstellung zu gewinnen, wie sich die Erik nier die Welt gedacht haben, werden wir am besten der Dar- stellung des Kundehesh folgen, welcher die verschiedenen An- schauungen zu einem Ganzen vereinigt hat, aus dem Avesta lässt sich durch beiläufige Erwähnungen folgern, dass das Bild, welches der Itundehesh eutH iift, ein getreues ist und auch die Verfasser der Avesta sicli ganz ähnliche Vorstellungen von der Welt machten. Zuerst müssen wir bemerken, dass man sich die Erde in der Art des menschlichen Körpers gebaut vorstellt«, die Berge bilden die Knochen, die Ströme das Blut, die Erde i) Vergl. hiena und iiun Folgenden überhaupt: Jutti, Sttträf >Hr aiUn Gtoi/raphU Persitnt f>. 3 ig. .zec.y Google VII.

Von den Itergen aber bildet die Hara-berezaiti oder der AlbuTJ gewissermaBseii das Rückgrat des ganiceu Kiiot^heu- oder Bc^ystems. Die Haia-bereeaiti ist nicht blos zuerst, Bondem auch am höchsten gewachseu, denn sie reicht bis su dem ewigen Licht« empor^j. Aus der Hara-berezaiti sind dann erst die übrigen Kerge der Erde herausgewachsen, die ^ahl derselben wird auf 2244 angegeben'';. Es ist aber die Hara-berezaiti nicht etwa ein einzelner Berg, sondem ein ganzer Gebii^nlcken , welcher um die ganze Erde herumgeht und, wie gesagt, bis zn dem Himmel reicht. Es hat dieser Ge^ biigszug Terschiedenc Gipfel, von denen jeder fieine besondere Bestimmung hat. Der Berg Taera oder Tire 'j ist derjiTnige, um den Sonne, Mond und St«me kreisen und an dem sie aus- und eingehen, denn an ein Auf- und Untergehen der Sonne denken die Eränier nicht. Der Gipfel Hukairya'*^ ist derjenige von dem die Quelle Ardvi-v^^iTi herabströmt. Ob auch ilendava oder Hovindnm und Arezilra grevaya oder Ar- KÜT grivak zu den Gipfeln der Hara-berezaiti zu ziehen seien, ist mir zweifelhaft. Dasselbe ^It von dem Berge ('ekät dtLi- tik, der in der Mitte der Welt stehen soll und von dem eine Brücke zum Himmel fuhrt. Die Hara-berezaiti ist also nach iranischer Vorstellung ein Itandgebii^e, welches, nicht blos die gesanimte Erde, sondern auch die See V&uru-kasha umgiebt und die letztere am Auslaufen verhindert. Die Berge der Welt hängen nun alle — natürlich unterirdisch — mit der Hara- berezaiti zusammen. Von einem der Gipfel dieses Gebirgs- zuges, dem Hukairya, wissen wie, dass er g^en Norden lag, denn die Quelle Ardvi-^iira kommt aus dieser Richtung und von diesem Berge.

Hier ist offen- bar nur von atmosphärischen ' Niederschlägen die R«de , von den Flüssen aber wird berichtet^), das« sie von der nördlichen Seite der Hara-berezaiti herahkommen und zwar strömen Ton dort zwei Flüsse aus, von denen der eine Ba^ha oder Arang- rät genannt wird und sich gegen Westen wendet, der andere heisst Vaguhi oder Veh-röt und wendet sich g^en Osten, lieber diesen letztem Fluss ist man längst im Beinen, denn der Kandehesh giebt an, er fliesse in das Land Sind und falle ins Meer, man nenne ihn auch Mehrva. Es ist ohne Zweifel der [ndus gemeint, der bei Masudi, Yäqüt und andern mos- lemischen Schriftstelleni den Namen Mehrän (q'**) fiibrt. Von dem Araiig-röt kennen wir wenigstens die Mündung , er fliesst nach Aegypten und wird der Nil genannt. Der I^uf der beiden Ströme war dem Verfasser dieser Darstellung offen- bar nur in der Nähe ihrer Mundung bekannt, von dem oberen Laufe des Indus wusate derselbe offenbar sehr wenig, noch weniger von dem des Nil. Deutlich ist aber hier, dass man sich beide in einem Oebiigslande entspringend dachte und ihre Quellen sehr nahe zu einander setzte. Ging man dem Laufe des einen oder andern Stromes bis zu seinen Quellen nach, so kam man nacli der Ansicht der Verfasser des Kundehesh und des Avesta auf die Hani-berezaiti. Auch scheint es mir klar zu sein, dass man sich das Veihältniss dieser beiden halb fabel- haften Strome zu einander in ganz ähnlicher Weise dachte, wie es zwisriien Euphrat und Tigris in Wirklichkeit besteht: von uahe an einander liegenden Quellen aufgehend, entfernten sich diese Weltatröme gegen Westen und Osten von einander mehr und mehr, aber nur um zuletzt im Meere Vduru-kasha sich wieder zu vereinigen.

Für die allge- meine Lage der verschiedenen Ijänder scheint mir eine AeuB- sening von Wichtigkeit') nach welcher der Ursprung des Winters in den Norden zu setzen ist, in die beiden Karesh- vares Vöura-barsti und VÄuni-jarsti , von da geht der Winter herüber auf den nördlichen Theil der Erde und zwar am Tage Anhoma, d. i. am ersten des Monat Apaiim (October-Novem- ber} ; am Tage Atun, d. i. den 9. des Monat IMn (December- Januar) kommt er mit grösserer Macht nach Erän-v^j, im Mo- nat ^endärmat (Februar-März) kommt er in die ganze Welt. Am ersten Tage des Monats Farvardtn (März-April) verschwin- det die Kälte wieder und der Sommer kommt herbei. Der Sommer hat seinen Sitz in den beiden südlich gelegenen Ka- reshvares in Fradadhafshu und VMadhafshu. Von den Län- dern dieser Erde ist Indien dem Sitze des Sommers am näch- sten, darum ist es dort am heissesten. Allein die Kraft des Sommers ist nicht so gross wie die des Winters, während es im äussersten Norden ganz kalt bleibt nnd keine Hitze dort- hin kommt, um die Macht des Winters zu mildem, dringt dag^en der Winter seiht in Indien ein, wo er in Gestalt von Regengüssen die iibergrosse Hitze mässigt. Diese Au&ssungs- weise scheint mir von grosser Bedeutung und ich stehe nicht an, sie dem Avesta selbst zuzuschreiben, obwot ich keine Stelle namhaft zu machen wüsste, wo diese Lehre bestimmt voi^e- tragen wird, mittelbar aber tritt sie hervor in einem der wich- tigsten geographischen Denkmale, welches uns das iranische Alterthom erhalten hat: in der Völkertafel im ersten Capitel des Vendtdäd. Man begreift nunmehr, warum diese ihre Aufzäh- lung mit Airyana-vaeja b^nnt und mit Hapta-hendu und mit Ragha endet.

Die Ansicht über die Lago der Länder in diceum llruchstücke des Aveeta ist bei mir ziem- lich dieselbe geblieben wie ich sie in einer früheren Ahhand- lung au^eetellt habe '] . Das nördliche Airyana-Taeja ist ge- wiss das spätere Arrän, die G^end die vom Araxes and Kur eingeschlosfien wird und zwar in ihrer grÖseten Ausdehnunii bis nach Tiflts am Kaukasus. Eine genaue KermtniBs äiesef^ Landes darf man freilich von den mehr im Innern und im Osten Krins lebenden Verfassern des Avesta und der übrigen Parsenbiiuher nicht erwarten. Es ist ein halb fabelhaftes Land, in dem nach späteren herichten die Menschen 30U Jahre alt werden, sie haben nicht das Gesetz des Zarathostra, sondern das der Paoiryd-lkaeehus (als diese Männer der Vorzeit dürften auch die Hewohuer Airyana- vaejas gedacht norden sein), ihr Oberhaupt ist der fabelhafte Gopatishih, der sich nur in spä^ teren Bücheren belegen tasst^). Der zweite, dritte und vierte Ort, den die VöUcertafel des Vendldid nennt, sind Gäu in ^ughdha, Mftum und B4kbdhi und es ist kein Zweifel darüber, dass man G&u in Sogdiana zu suchen hat, Möuru das äussejre Merv, Bäkbdbi das heutige Balkh ist, bei diesen Orten ist also die Richtung vom Norden nach Süden eingehalten. Der fünfte Ort ist Ni9Äya, aber er ist nicht mehr nachzuweisen, da uns jedoch gesagt wird, derselbe liege zwischen M&uru und B&khdhi, so wird man ihn etwa auf gleicher Höhe mit diesen Städten zu suchen haben, bei Andkhui, Shibergän und Meimana. Der sechste Ort, Haraeva, ist bekanntlich das heutige Herät, der siebente, Vaekereta, soll nach der ziemlich wahrscheinlichen Tradition in Kibul liegen, also beide südlicher als die firüher genannten Städte.

Article: — Der Geschäftsbericht der Deutschen Feuerversicherungs Actiengesellschaft in Berlin besagt , dafs das unmittelbare Geschäft günstig gearbeitet , die grofsen Ortsbrände in Schweden da gegen ungünstig eingewirkt hätten , infolge dessen die Gesellschaft sich veranlafst sah , ihre Thätigkeit in Schweden einzustellen. Die Gebühren einnahme beträgt 1089 270 oder 31 532 = 4 mehr , wovon 1010599c auf das unmittelbare und 78670c auf das mittelbare Geschäft entfallen ; an Schäden waren dagegen zu zahlen 146 29404 für das eigene und 132899. für das Rückversicherungsgeschäft. Der Reingewinn von 123 154 - / ( 1887 138696. 4 ) gestattet bei 30583. / Zuwendung zur Rücklage die Ver teilung von 14 % gegen 15 % im Vorjahre. — Von den Braunschwei gischen Kohlengewerken wurde ein Roh - Betriebsüberschufs von 523964 - A ( + 94634 - 4 ) erzielt , wovon als Rohgewinn 418312¼ und nach Abzug der Gesamtabschreibungen von 175000. ein Reingewinn von 243312 - 4 verbleiben ( + 41332 - ). Derselbe ermöglicht die Vertei lung von 5 % an die Vorrechts - und von 1½ % für die Stammactien. Auch im Berichtsjahre hat auf sämtlichen Betrieben eine erhebliche Steigerung in der Förderung bezw. der Prefskohlen - Anfertigung stattgefunden. Die Gesamtförderung der Gruben betrug 5882 557h1 ( + 1 078980hl ). Der Absatz war im ganzen Jahre befriedigend. □ Wiener Börsennachrichten. Wien , 1. April. Die Hauptver sammlung der Brünner Local - Eisenbahngesellschaft be schlofs , aus dem Reingewinne für 1888 , in welchem der Gewinn aus dem im Vorjahre eingeführten Frachtenverkehr nicht enthalten ist , 5¼ % Dividende zu zahlen. — Die Oesterr. Portland - Cementfabrik Gésellschaft zahlt für 1888 5 % Dividende. — Die Allgemeine österreichische Baugesallschaft erzielte für 1888 174801fl Reingewinn , sodafs einschliefslich des Gewinnvortrages im ganzen 287 153fl zur Verfügung stehen. Es werden 5 % Dividende gezahlt und 119673fl auf neue Rechnung vorgetragen. — Die Steigerung der Los werte nahm heute weitern Fortgang. Die starke Steigerung der Bodencreditlose und der Ungarischen Hypothekenlosc ist im Hinblick auf den namhaften Besitz der Bodencredit - Anstalt bezw. der Unionbank für beide Banken von namhaftem Vorteil. # # * Vom Antwerpener Platze wird uns mitgeteilt , dafs bei dem schon mehrfach erwähnten Zusammenbruche der Firma Ferd. van der Taelen sämtliche Bankanstalten Antwerpens für die dem Hause durch Auslieferung von Schiffsurkunden zur Entlöschung der Waren gewährten Vorschüsse beteiligt sind , und zwar die Banque de Wolf und Antwerpener Centralbank mit je rund 300000fr , die Banque ’ Anvers mit einem geringern Betrage ( 240000fr ) und die andern Anstalten mit kleinern Summen. Die Abschlüsse für das Jahr 1888 der erst - und letztgenannten Bank sind bereits erschienen ; die Centralbank , die teilt übrigens mit , des letzten Jahres eine reichliche Summe zu Forderung an die zahlungsunfähige Getreidefirma zu verwenden , und gleichwohl in der Lage sei , ihren Actionären in gewohnter Weise 6 % Dividende unter Vornahme der üblichen Rücklagen zur Verteilung zu bringen. Die angestellten Ermittlungen haben dagegen ergeben , dafs keine deutsche Bank an der Zahlungseinstellung beteiligt ist. * Vom Pariser Platze. Dem Journal Paris zufolge haben die Liquidatoren des Comptoir ’ Escompte dem Finanzminister Rouvier gestern Vormittag die Vertreter der verschiedenen Bankhäuser vorgestellt , welche eine Vereinigung zur Wiederherstellung des Comp toir ’ Escompte auf neuen Grundlagen zu bilden beabsichtigen. Die Verhandlung habe einen sehr günstigen Erfolg gehabt und es sei zu erwarten , dals das Comptoir ’ Escompte alsbald auf Grundlagen neu errichtet werde , welche den Beteiligten jede Gewähr böten. Die Liqui datoren sollten ferner noch gestern zu einer wichtigen Verhandlung mit den Vertretern der americanischen Kupfergruben zu sammentreten. — Dem „ Temps “ zufolge hat sich die Monatsab wicklung an der Börse ohne Schwierigkeiten vollzogen ; der Betrag der nicht bezahlten Wertpapiere übersteige nicht den Durch schnitt der vorausgegängenen Monate. § Vom New - Yorker Geldmarkt. London , 1. April. In den letzten Tagen sind an der New - Yorker Börse , wieder starke Schwankun gen namentlich in Union Pacific - und Atchison - Actien vorgekommen , zum Teil ohne Zweifel infolge erneuter Leerverkäufe , zum Teil aber wohl auch , weil Unternehmer , die Voranskäufe vorgenommen hatten , diese rückgängig machen mufsten. Bei der später folgenden Erholung waren Louisville - Nashville - Actien besonders fest. Der Wochenausweis der New - Yorker Vereinigten Banken zeigt eine Einbufse von 2¼ Millionen Dollars an bar und Regierungsnoten und eine Ab nahme des Ueberschusses der Rücklage über den gesetzlichen Mindest betrag um 1¼ Millionen. Dieser Ueberschufs beträgt jetzt 5½ Millionen gegen 9¼ Millionen in der gleichen Woche 1888. s Aegyptische Staatsschuld. London , 1. April.

In der Streitfrage wegen der Rückzahlun wandlung der Vorzugsanlerhe stützt sich eine Anzahl der hie sigen Inhaber bekanntlich darauf , dals bei der Neuregelung der ägyp tischen Schuld im Jahre 1876 die Regierung sich keine Befugnis zur Vermehrung des Tilgungsbetrages ( über den zur Einlösung in 65 Jahren notwendigen Satz hinaus ) ausbedungen habe und sie daher eine solche Befugnis nicht besitze , also eine raschere Einlösung bezw. eine Um wandlung der Vorzugsanleihe nur unter Zustimmung der Gläubiger vornehmen könne. Anderseits scheinen die ägyptische Regierung und die von ihr zu Rat gezogenen Rechtsgelehrten der Ansicht zu sein , dafs die Befugnis zur frühern Rückzahlung bezw. Umwandlung ihr auch ohne ausdrücklichen Vorbehalt zustehe. Mehr als um die Rechtsfrage wird es sich schliefslich darum handeln , ob die Mächte die Umwand lung gutheilsen werden oder nicht , und die Haltung der Mächte wird wieder zum Teil von dem Interesse der einzelnen Staatsangehörigen sowohl als von allgemein politischen Beweggründen beeinflufst werden. Es läfst sich daher schwer voraussagen , wie die Entscheidung ausfällt. - Lyon , 31. März. Rohseide.

Roggen eröffnete zwar auch ziemlich fest , die starke Kündigung von 7850t rief aber bald eine recht gedrückte Stimmung hervor. Hafer bewahrte ziemlich feste Haltung.

Ein an ziehender , durch Vorführung von Mustern unterstützter Vortrag des Herrn Ingenieur Bartsch von Siegsfeld in der letzten Vereinssitzung gab ein anschauliches Bild von der hohen Wichtigkeit dieses Planes , gegen 30 möglichst langwährende Auffahrten des Ballons sollen den nötigen Beobachtungsstoff liefern. Der Plau fand im Verein und auch außerhalb lebhafte Unterstützung. Aus der Vereinscasse wur den 500. 4 bewilligt. Einige der bedeutendsten Großindustriellen haben dem Verein für den Bedarf an Stahldrahtkabel , Ballonseide u. s. w. bedeutende Preisermäßigungen angeboten. So dürfte die Ausführ barkeit des wichtigen Unternehmens als gesichert erscheinen. ( Aus dem Kreise Kempen , 27. März. Obwohl die Eisenbahnstrecke Dülken = Waldniel = Brüggen längst genehmigt , abgemessen und abgepfählt ist , so ist mit dem Ausbau dieser Bahn , die den aufblühenden Dachziegelfabriken Brüggens neue Absatzgebiete erschließen wird , bis jetzt noch nicht begonnen worden. Die Stadt Dülken hat sich zur Zeit verpflichtet , den erforderlichen Grund und Boden frei herzugeben. Die Grunderwerbskosten , die man auf 30 000 A veranschlagt , befaufen sich aber auf 70000. / Darin liegt der Grund , daß diese Strecke noch nicht ausgebaut ist , denn weil die Kosten so bedeutend über die veranschlagte Summe hinausgehen , ist die Stadt Dülken in erneute Verhandlungen mit Grundeigentümern und der Eisenbahnverwaltung getreten , um allenfalls die Baulinie in ein billigeres Gelände zu verlegen. — Daß ein Bedürfnis zur Errich tung einer Gemüsebauschule im hartbedrängten niederrheinischen Weverbezirk zur Einführung eines andern Erwerbszweiges vorlag , beweisen die zahlreichen Anmeldungen , die zu dem am 1. April in Breyell beginnenden Lehren # # # s exfolgt sind. Die meisten Zöglinge sind aus dem Kreise Kempen ; aus allen Gegenden Rheinlands und Westfalens sind Gesuche um Aufnahme gekommen. — Da die Seiden stofffabriken in den letzten Wochen größere Aufträge erhalten haben , so finden viele arbeitslose Samtweber lohnende Beschäftigung in den Stofffabriken oder als Seidenweber auf dem Handwebstuhl. 5 Aus Westfalen , 30. März. Eine in diesen Tagen zu Gelsen kirchen stattgehabte , von etwa 1000 polnischen Katholiken besuchte Versammlung beschloß , an die bischöfliche Behörde zu Paderborn und an den katholischen Kirchenvorstand zu Gelsenkirchen eine Eingabe wegen Anstellung eines zweiten polnischen Geistlichen zu richten. — Auf dem westfälischen Antisemitentage soll nach neuerer Vereinbarung , damit der Parteitag nicht unter der Fehde „ Dr. König contra Dr. Böckel “ zu leiden hat , an Stelle des Dr. Böckel Herr Hof prediger Stöcker aus Berlin an den Verhandlungen teilnehmen. — Morgen wird die Dechenhöhle für den Besuch des Publicums wieder geöffnet und werden die Personenzüge daselbst halten. C Recklinghausen , Reg. = Bez. Münster , 30. März. Das drei Jahre alte Söhnchen eines Höfners zu Oer hatte sich vor etlichen Wochen beim Spielen in der Haardt , einer benachbarten weit aus gedehnten Heide , verirrt. Wiederholtes Durchsuchen der Heide blieb erfolglos. Gestern Abend endlich fand ein Jäger aus Gelsen kirchen die Leiche des Kindes , die zwischen dichtem , kurzen Gestrüpp halbverborgen lag.

Article: TV Südbaden war ein regionales TV-Vollprogramm für Südbaden, das von September 2001 bis Januar 2015 von der Funkhaus Freiburg GmbH & Co. KG in Freiburg im Breisgau (Baden-Württemberg), einer Tochtergesellschaft der Neue Welle Rundfunk-Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH & Co. KG, Nürnberg (Funkhaus Nürnberg), angeboten wurde.

TV Südbaden arbeitete im Funkhaus Freiburg eng mit dem Lokalradiosender baden.fm zusammen.

Geschichte 
Der Sender ging am 15. September 2001 unter dem Namen FR TV auf Sendung und heißt seit einem Programmrelaunch im Mai 2003 TV Südbaden. Im Jahr erreichte TV Südbaden nach Mediadatenanalyse durchschnittlich etwa 500.000 Zuschauer in Südbaden.

Am 16. Januar 2015 wurde der Sendebetrieb aus finanziellen Gründen eingestellt. Laut eigenen Angaben war es durch eine geringe Kabelabdeckung in Südbaden und damit einen zu geringen Durchdringungsgrad nicht möglich, kostendeckend zu arbeiten.

Im Frühjahr 2017 hat Baden TV das Sendegebiet von TV Südbaden, also die Stadt- und Landkreise Freiburg, Emmendingen, Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Ortenaukreis, Lörrach und Waldshut, übernommen.

So wurde denn beute (9. Auguft) Bievenfeld um 4 Uber Morgens ebenfalls ſtandrechtlich erſchoſ⸗ fen. &r batte feine, nicht die gerinafte politifhe Einſicht; Feis nerlei politiſche Gefinnung war die Triebfeder feiner Handluns gen, Er war ein Haudegen, ein alter Soldat, der nichtd kannte als fen Schwert; durch bobe Ungnade früh zur Rube gefcht, zief ihn die Revolution wieder zur Thätigkeit; dem Gebot der Wir find im Stand, das allein Wahre ' proviſoriſchen Regierung folgend, nahm er die Wabl zum Oberſt bed 3. Regimentes an, in dem er früber gedient batte, und machte mehrere Gefechte mit. Als er im Gericht darüber zur Rete geflelt ward, antwortete er: „Angegriffen babe ib die Preußen nit; ic wurde angegriffen, und bei Gott — wenn ih angegriffen werde, muß ich mich doch wehren!“ Sei einer ſolchen Gelegenheit, wo er ſich wehrte, blieben von einer Shwas dron preußifher Hufaren 46 Mann, die ihm und feinen Trup⸗ pen zu nahe gefommen waren, Preußiſche Hufaren, wenn auch nicht vom felben Regiment, haben ibn beute früb in die Ewig⸗ keit befördert. Darüber war man einig, daß, wenn ſtreng ges richtet werde, Biedenfeld den Tod ermarten müffe, wenn er au ohne alle revolutionären Grundfäße, obne zu wiſſen, was er that, allem Anſchein nah nur um wieder Pulver zu riechen und zu commandiren, fib den Empörern angeſchloffen batte; mit wen, für wen, gegen wen, das hat er wohl faum übers legt. Desbalb erſchien er zwar ſchuldig, aber minder ſchuldig, als die Andern; und als die erſten 24 Stunden vorüber war ren, freute fib doch Mancher für ihn, daß er begnadigt werde. Nun aber wurde er gegen dad Gefep, und nad einer zweima⸗ ligen Borbereitung zum Tode, der Hoffnung nicht zu gedenten, die man ihm wieder zum Leben gemadt hatte, mebr denn 60 Stunden nad der Publication des LUrtbeild erſchoſſen. Was muß den andern, viel ſchlimmern Rädelsführern geſchehen, wenn man Biedenfeld zweimcl getödtet bat? Seine legte Stunde war, in Gegenwart des Geiftliben, einer würdigen Worbereis tung zum Tode gewibmet; er lad ein ſchönes religidfes Gedicht, ebe er feine Zele verließ, umd folgte entfchloffen na der Nichts ſtãtte. Das beilige Abendmabl hatte er ſchon vor einigen Ta⸗ gen verlangt, ald er zum erften Mal die Erecution erwartete. Eifenband hat no vor feinem Tode an feinen Bott geglaubt. — Die andern Erecutionen werden ſich nun raſch folgen; man fpribt von Mojor Heilig, ald einem der nähften; auch Tiede⸗ mann’d Bertbeidiger ift angefommen und wird nicht viel Zeit brauden, um fich vorzubereiten, denn an Tiedemann iſt wenig oder nichts zu vertbeidigen. Derfelbe wird Morgen vor das Kriegögeribt geflelt werten. — Ueber Kinkel it noch nichts weitered bekannt, ald daß er zu Iebendlänglicher Feitungäftrafe verurtbeilt fei oder werden folle. Wiesbaden, 9. Aug. Heute Nahmittag um 1 Ubr rüdte die Batterie, welche bei Edernförde gefochten, in ihre bie, fige Garnifon wieder ein. Die Straßen, durch melde die tapferen Ranoniere zogen, waren geibmüdt und am @ingange der Kaferne hatten die Kammeraden der Heimfehrenden durch allerlei Schmuck von Krängen, Fadnen x. den frennblicen Empfang verſinnbildlicht. Der Mannſchaft voran wurde rine erbeutete bänifbe Fahne getragen. Die auf den Sieg bei Edernförde geprägte Medaille fbmüdte bereitd die Bruft der braven Soldaten. — Ihre königl. Hobeit die verwittwete Frau Herzogin, welcde am Sonntag erft bier eingetroffen if, reift beute Nachmittag wieder ab nad Gtralfund, um dort mit ber Großfürftin Helene von Rußland zufammenyutreffen. Berlin, 8. Auguf. ine bedeutfame Partei fbeint ſich unter Abgeordneten der zweiten Kammer unter Führung ber Abgeordneten: v. Bederatb, 9. v. Aurrömwald, G. v. Schwer rin, Sampbaufen (Bruder der früberen Minifterd), v. Viebahn N . ı Harkort und Riedel zu bilden. Es wird dieſe Partei die „deut ehemalige Major, fpäter Obrift bei ten Auflländifben, v. Bie | ſche“ genannt. Als Programm fteüt diefelbe auf: Revifion der Berfaffung vom 5. Deyember in dem Sinne der Sicherung der unverfürgten Theilnabme jeder der drei Staatägewalten an der Gefeßgebung. Sicherung der Rechte der Krone wie des Bolfed und unantafibare Aufrebtbaltung der üffentliben Ord⸗ nung. Nachdrückiche Unterlügung ded Minifteriumd bei Durds führung des von Preußen ausgegangenen deutſchen Berfaffunges Entwurfs. Gleichheit der Beteuerung, mithin feine Grundfteuers befreiung in einzelnen Provinzen. In der Parteiitellung der gegenwärtigen zweiten Kammer dürfte die eben bejeichnete Par⸗ tei dad Gentrum bilden und viedeiht die Stimmenmebrbeit er» langen. Diefem Gentrum gegenüber ſcheint fib unter Fübrung des frühern Minifterd Gr. v. Arnim⸗Boitzenburg die eigentliche Rechte zu bilten, die mit dem Gentrum vielleicht hauptſäch⸗ ih nur in der deutfchen Wnaelegenbeit nicht denfelben Gang geben wird. Die äußerſte Rechte, die indeffen ebenſo uns bedeutend if, wie die von den polnifhen Abgeordneten gebils dete äußerfle Linke, dürfte ihre Führer in Bidmart-Echons baufen und v. Kleiſt findeg. In melder Weife fib die Linke in der Kammer geftalten wird, ift noch nicht zu überſchauen. Ratürlih darf man dabei an keine Linfe denken, bei welder 887: die Aufrechthaltung des Königthums im Beringfien in Frage leben könnte. Der Abg. Ev. Simfon batfib beider „Deuts ſchen“ Partei noch nicht in fo hervorteetender Weiſe betbeiligt, daß er mit unter den Fübrern genannt werden konnte. Viele Abgeordnete diefer Partei beabfichtigen indeffen, ihn zum Präs fiventen der zweiten Kammer vorzufhlagen. Die Wabl deffels ihm zwei Sandidaten entgegenfteben, auf melde fib aus befons dern Rüdfibten gegenwärtig eher die Stimmenmebrbeit werfen tönnte. Diefe beiven in Borfhlag gebraten Candidaten find Graf v. Schwerin und Graf v. ArnimsBoißenburg. bei Bifteiz 30,000 Mann Ruffen unter Grotenbielm. Der ans dere Theil des Börgey den Gorpd wandte fib von Rima Szomdath nit nad der Tdeiß, fondern nördlich; zeigte ſich bei ‚ Yifalu und Kaſchau in dem Gomörer und Zipfer Gomitat oder im ' Zatragebirge. (Genauere Angaben fehlen. Die Kaſchauer Por iſt lyihal hinauf von Schemni aber feit 7 Tagen nicht nach Galizien gegangen, aud follen im: u Leutſchau ſich Mleinere Streifcorpsd der Infurgenten gezeigt haben.) ben dürfte aber eine zmeifelhafte genannt werden fönnen, da | Diefe Gtreitfräfte der Magyaren werden von General Grabbe verfolgt, der bei dem Marſche Görgey’s von Waiten das Ipos berbeigerüdt war.

Der Staatsanwalt zählte die Thatſachen auf, deren fib Tiedemann ſchuldig gemacht babe, mos rauf Tiedemann über alle Vorfälle, wobei er betbeiligt gemwefen, fi ausführlich verbreitete und im biefer Herzählung nict nur alle Sympathie für die Anſtiſter ded Aufftande, Struve, Brentano, Sigel u. f. f. verläugmete und berfelben oft in ſehr verächtlicher Weife gedachte, fondern auch allen feinen eigenen Handlungen entweder eine gute Abfit unterzus legen fuchte, als babe er die Sache des Aufrubrd auf geiehe | lihe Wege und zur conftitutionellen Monarchie zurüdführen | wolen, oder feine Dienftleiftungen ald die einer untergeordnes | ten Militärperfon darftellte, welche in Folge einmal eingegans gener Berpflihtungen blind den Befehlen höherer Borgefepten | babe folgen müffen.

Uedrigens babe er, wie dieß überhaupt im ganzen Feldzug auf Seiten der Preis beitöfoldaten oft der Fall geweſen, damals gar nicht gewußt, ges gen wen er feuern laffe; er habe nicht gewußt, wer vor ibm, mer auf feiner Seite war, ob Freund oder Feind.“ Diefe ein« zige fonderbare Behauptung ausgenommen, vertheidigte ſich Tier demann mit Ernft und Würde und erregte durch feine Haltung ein Gefühl von Achtung in der zubörenden Berfammlung. Nach allen Thatſachen befand ſich fein Bertheidiger, ein junger Ads votat, Levinger, auf ungünftigem Boden. Died vorandfühlend fuchte er die Competenz des Kriegs⸗ oder Gtandgerichtd anzus greifen. Aber der Präfed erflärte die Zufländigfeit ded Berichts und fomit mußte der Beriheidiger zur Sache ſelbſt übergeben, aber einmal ſprach fo wenig oder nichts für den Ungeflag- ten und dann mißglüdten Hrn.

Obſchon Tiedemann geftand, mie er ſich nicht verhehle, daß es ſich nicht metr um fein Leben handle, daß bereits hierüber befimmt zu fein ſcheine und daß er dem Tode oft genug ind Auge geieben babe, bier und in Griechenland, um auch jetzt nicht davor zu zittern, fo fuchte er ſich doch äußerft lebhaft zu vertbeidigen und den Ums fand, daß die Richter nicht ganz einflimmig urtheilten, bat Tiedemann wobl mebr ſich felbft, d. h. feinem eigenen Vortrag zuzuſchreiben, ald feinem Bertbeidiger, wiewohl diefer im Gans zen nicht fehler gefprocen bat.

Article: Am Nordpol, ober Reise-Erlebnisse im hohen Norden. 20. Mit einem Wort, jenes glänzende, mitternächtliche Licht war eines jener Nordlichter, die so oft die Oede der Polarregionen erleuchten und mitten in ihrer Finsterniß einen Strahl, hervorgehend aus der Größe Gottes, erglänzen lassen, um jene enterbten Flächen aufzuklären und über sie die Hoffnung des Lebens auszugießen. Martin, ben ber oftmalige Besuch ber Norbküsten an ben Anblick biefer meteorolo» zischen Phänomene unb all biefer Launen des Lichtes gewöhnt hatte, ben jeboch biefer Glanz in einer ungeheuren Gefahr und in tiefer Nacht überraschte, gcrieth gleichsam in Verzückung; er betrachtete all diese Golblreise, diese Scharlachflammcn, biese Spiegelungen, diese Funlen, diese Silberregen, als ob bas »lles Mitleib mit ihm fühlte, als ob biefes «länzenbe unb reine Licht ihm zur Rettung «strahlte. Die Strahlen, welche in bem Schaume ber Fluthen tanzten, steigerten ben Olanz dieses Schauspiels, unb inbem sie in l'en Eisspalten sich wieberspiegelten, schufen sie dort tausenb Regenbogen, fo baß man Wte glauben mögen, man fähe «us biefen enblose, gleich kostbaren Steinen schimmernde Strömungen hervorkommen. Doch wührenb bei unglückliche Schiffbrüchige bie» l«s glänzende Phänomen betrachtete, fah er «ach unb nach all biefen Glanz erblaffen, zuerst in orangenfarbige Tinte sich verwanbeln, bann in ein Rosa mit Vlaßblau ver» vermischt, bas allmählig sich verwischte, in» bem es mit den am Horizont auftauchenben Nebeln sich verschmolz, bie bereit ftanben, bas Meer mit einem büstern, feuchten, kalten unb sich mehr unb mehr verbichtenben Schleier zu bebecken. Mitten in biefeu nächtlichen Schrecken erinnerte sich Martin als Franzose unb Katholik ber frommen Erziehung, bie er von feiner Mutter in feinem Torfe im Loirethale er» halten hatte, am Fuße bes Gebirges von Louvesc, auf befsen Gipfcl bas berühmte Grab bes heiligen Franz Rezis sich besinbet, unb bas fo viele Taufcnbe frommer Alpen» bewohner jährlich als Wallfahrer ersteigen, um Gnaben unb Wunber zu erlangen. Er empfahl sich inbrünstig biefem Heiligen; unb inbem er ihn erinnerte, baß er von dem Al» ter von acht Jahren an bis zu feinem Jung» lingsalter nie ermangelt habe, im Monat Juni fein Fest mit feiner Mutter unb feinen Schwestern, bie fo fromm waren, zu feiern unb jeben Abenb beim Familiengebete zart» lich feinen Namen anzurufen, bat er ihn, nicht zuzugeben, daß er zwischen ben Eis» massen zermalmt, ober in bie Meeresabgrünbe velfenlt würbe. Gleichfalls gedachte er, wie er nach seinem Einzug in Rom im Juli 1849 mit der siegreichen Armee des Marschalls Oudinot oft zum Grabe des heiligen Petrus, zum wunderthätigen Bilde der Santa Maria Maggiore, zu den Basiliken und Gräbern der heiligen Märtyrer gegangen sei unb alle biefe Seligen um das Heil seiner Seele und für die Wohlfahrt Frankreichs angefleht habe; unb nun bat er sie von Neuem unb flehte instänbig, ihn nicht umkommen zu lassen. Zu Rom hatte er ben Pater Philipp angetroffen, einen eifrigen, französischen Mönch, bessen süße und ermuthigenbe Liebe ihn bähin gebracht hatte, eine gute Eeneralbeicht seiner Sünben abzulegen; als Andenken an seine tugendhaften Vorsätze hatte er von ihm eine schöne Medaille der unbefleckten Emvfängniß erhalten, die er stets liebend an seinem Halse trug; in dieser Lebensgefahr nun ergriff er sie mit beiden Hänben, lüßte sie mit kinb» licher Liebe, brückte sie wider sein Herz unb empfahl sein Leben ber Mutter bei Liebe.

Bei biefem Anblick dankte Martin bet Mabonn» aus tiefster Seele; hierauf krümmte er sich zu» sammen unb half sich mit Hänben und Füßen, und es glückte ihm, auf bie Eisbank hinab zu gelangen; von da wendete er sich, nachdem er Athem geschöpft hatte, dem Fest» lande zu, inbem er stets mit seinem langen, spitzigen Stocke den Pfad vor sich Prüfte, aus Furcht, er möchte in eine Spalte stürzen. Als er das Boot zur Erklimmung des Eisblockes verlassen hatte, um weithin schauen zu können, und in dem Gedanken, sogleich wieder zu seinen Gefährten zurückzukehren, hatte er seinen gezogenen Carabiner zurückgelassen.

Article: Fürst Stanisław Poniatowski (* 23. November 1754 in Warschau; † 13. Februar 1833 in Florenz) war polnischer Generalleutnant und Großkämmerer von Litauen.

Leben

Herkunft 
Stanislaw war ein Prinz aus dem polnischen Fürstengeschlecht Poniatowski. Seine Eltern waren der polnische General der Kronarmee, Fürst Kazimierz Poniatowski (1721–1800) und Apolonia Ustrzycka (1736–1814). Er war Neffe des letzten polnischen Königs Stanislaus II. August Poniatowski.

Werdegang 
Poniatowski war Senator des Sejm. Er war in die Ereignisse seiner Zeit durch die Nähe zum Königshaus natürlicher Weise eingebunden. So war er Mitglied der Konföderation von Targowica, seit 1784 Großkämmerer von Litauen und Kritiker der Verfassung vom 3. Mai 1791. Poniatowski war Starost in Podlachien, stand ebenfalls als Offizier in der polnischen Kronarmee, wo er bis in den Rang eines Generalleutnants beim Garde-Regiment zu Fuß avancierte.

Im Jahre 1773 erhielt er den Orden des Weißen Adlers, war ebenfalls Träger des Orden des Heiligen Andreas des Erstberufenen und trat 1797 auch dem russischen Großpriorat des Souveränen Malteserordens bei.

Poniatowski besaß einen Palast in Warschau in der Frascati-Straße, von wo aus er als ein Kunstmäzen, ein Förderer der Malerei und Sammler von Kunstgegenständen und Gemmen auftrat. Ebenfalls dort wohnte sein Freund, der polnische General und Gesandte Carl Friedrich Ernst von Cocceji. Ein weiterer Familiensitz befand sich seit 1789 in Korsuń, wo auch ausgedehnter Güterbesitz der Familie vorhanden war. 

Nach den Teilungen Polens emigrierte Poniatowski nach Rom und dann 1820 nach Florenz. 1830 veröffentlichte er einen Katalog mit der Zusammenfassung seiner Gemmen. Nach seinem Tod wurde die Sammlung bei Christie’s im Jahr 1839 verkauft und damit zerstreut.

Familie 
Poniatowski hatte mit Kassandra Luci di Tivoli (1785–1863) fünf natürliche Kinder, von denen die Söhne legitimiert wurden und 1847 bzw. 1850 eigene Erhebungen in den Grafen- bzw. Fürstenstand erfuhren.
Isabella Luci (1806–1896), ⚭I 1821 Graf Prospero Bentivoglio († 1821); ⚭ 1822 Graf Zanobi di Ricci († 1844); ⚭III Markgraf Filippo De Piccolellis
Anna Maria di Ricci, ⚭ 1846 Graf Alexandre Colonna-Walewski (1810–1868)
Carlo Poniatowski (1808–1887), Graf von Monterotondo (1847), Fürst von Monterotondo (1850), ⚭ 1831 Elisa Napoleone Montecatini (1808–1893)
Costanza Luci (1811–1851); ⚭ Graf Daniele Zappi
Giuseppe Michele Saverio Francesco Giovanni Poniatowski (1816–1873), Graf von Monterotondo (1847), Fürst von Monterotondo (1850), Sänger und Komponist, Gesandter des Großherzogs der Toskana in Paris, London und Brüssel ⚭ 1834 Gräfin Matilda Perotti (1814–1875)

Eine Studie, vorgetragen 6. Nov. 1877 in der medicinisch- chirurgischen Gesellschaft des Cantons Zürich. Von Prof« Dr« fidnt« Roiite^ Dlnetor der ohlmrg. KUnik in Zftrieh. Das Vorkommen krebsartiger Neubildungen in alten Kröpfen steht heut zu Tage ausser aller Frage. Schon Philipp von Walther unterschied ja eine besondere Art des Kropfes: die Struma carci- nomatosa, den Krebskropf. Im Gegensatz dazu wollte freilich noch Larrey den lymphatischen Kropf, eben so wie den scirrhösen, in die Lymphdrüsen am Halse verweisen, mit der Behauptung, dass die Schilddrüse in der Regel ganz unversehrt bei solchen Fällen bleibe. Allein schon 1841 hat dann Engel zwei Fälle von isolirtem Harkschwamm der Schilddrüse mitgetheilt, denen später zweifel- lose Fälle von malignen Neubildungen durch die Bemühungen von Virchow, Förster, Schuh, v. Bruns und so vielen anderen gefolgt sind. Lebert hat sich dann 1862 zuerst an die klinische Bearbeitung des Krebskropfes gemacht, der er zu seinem Erstaunen aus älterer und neuerer Zeit nur 23 Falle zu Grunde legen konnte. Und noch dazu sind unter diesen 23 Fällen noch 3 von secun- därem Krebs der Schilddrüse enthalten. Es ging daraus wieder hervor, dass, wie schon vor ihm Rokitansky ausgesprochen und noch jüngst wieder Virchow in seinen Geschwülsten ebenfalls be- tont hat, der Krebskropf zu den seltenen Afifectionen gehört. Ebenso scheint nach allen diesen Beobachtern ziemlich sicher, dass in kropffreien Gegenden, wie z. B. in Berlin, an den normalen Schild- f. Langenbeek, Archiv f. Chirurgie. XXIII. 1. 1 2 Dr. Edm. Rose, drüsen noch weniger von diesem Leiden zu sehen ist. Freiburg, Tübingen, Würzburg, Bern, vor allem aber Zürich, hat bis jetzt das grösste Contingent der bekannten Fälle geliefert. In der That gehört hier in Zürich der Krebskropf nicht zu den grossen Selten- heiten; vergeht doch kein Jahr, dass nicht mindestens ein neuer Fall mir hier vorkommt, wenn diese Kranken auch meist nur kometenartig mit mir bei Gonsultationen in Berührung kommen. Von 9 Fällen jedoch besitze ich ausfuhrlichere Notizen. Wie steht es danach mit der chirurgischen Behandlung des Krebskropfes? Lebert's Schluss ist einfach; der Refrain seiner Arbeit über den Krebskropf lautet: »Behandlung. Bei der bekannten Unheilbarkeit des Uebels kann diese natürlich nur eine palliative sein. In zweifel- haften Fällen allein ist Jodgebrauch indicirt. Sonst nähre man die Kranken gut, suche sie durch Narcotica bei Athembeschwerden und Schmerzen möglichst zu erleichtem, enthalte sich aller chirurgi- schen Eingriffe, da Stich und Schnitt gewöhnlich nur zu exuberi- render Krebswucherung führen und die Exstirpation zwar die Leiden der Kranken abkürzt, aber auf Kosten des Lebens. "* Kurz, alle Krebse sind unheilbar, also ist erst recht auch von der Therapie des Krebskropfes nicht die Rede. Auch nach Lücke, dem neuesten Monographen der Schilddrüsenkrankheiten , »müssen wir die Schild- drüsensarcome als Noli me tangere betrachten **, und kann sich die Therapie beim Krebs nur darauf beschränken, die Kräfte des Kran- ken zu erhalten, ihm seine Schmerzen zu mildem. Nach alledem bestünde also die Hauptaufgabe des Chirurgen darin, sich vor dem Krebskropf in Acht zu nehmen. Der Schwerpunkt des klinischen Interesses fiele also dahin, sich vor einer Verwechselung mit den relativ gutartigen Kröpfen zu behüten! Was hat man denn nun also für Zeichen, um den Krebskropf zu erkennen? um ihn zu vermeiden? Lücke drückt sich darüber folgendermassen aus : Die Diagnose des Schilddrüsenkrebses beruht auf der besonderen Art von dessen Wachsthum und auf dem Auf- treten der Lymphdrüsenschwellungen. Wenn eine Stmma, welche lange Zeit still stand, wieder anfangt zu wachsen und schmerz- haft wird, so ist dies besonders nach dem 35i bis 40. Jahre in hohem Grade verdächtig; wenn dies Wachsthum langsam vor- schreitet, keine Cystenbildung in der Struma sich zeigt und wenn nun Lymphdrüsen -Anschwellungen entstehen, so ist die Diagnose Die Chirurg. Behandlung der carcinomatösen Struma (des Krebskropfes). 8 sicher. Daza kommen die frühzeitigen Schlingbeschwerden und die Beschaffenheit des Tumors, besonders seine gewöhnlich betracht- liche Härte, welche nicht nur dem Scirrhus, sondern auch dem Drüsenkrebs eigen ist. Lücke halt den Verlauf des Schilddrüsen- krebses im Allgemeinen für einen langsamen. Lebert ist darüber wohl mit Recht anderer Meinung. „Die ang^Iichen Fälle yon Jahre langem Verlauf des Schilddrüsen- krebses beruhen wohl auf diagnostischen Irrthümem'', sagt Lebert. »Die rasche Entwickelung der Schilddrüsengeschwulst, das Älter der Kranken zwischen 40 und 60 Jahren, das schon frühe Leiden der allgemeinen Gesundheit, Abmagerung, schlechter Teint, Ver- last der Kräfte, trübe Stimmung, schlaflose Nächte sichern in der Regel*, nach Lebert 's Meinung, „allein schon die Diagnose.'' «Hierzu kommt denn noch gewöhnlich die ganze Reihe der Com- pressions*Erscheinungen auf Kehlkopf und Luftröhre, auf die Zweige des Vagus, auf die Halsgefässe, auf die Bifurcation der Trachea hinter dem Stemum, die entweder weiche, lappige Markschwamm- geschwulst oder der harte, höckerige Scirrhus, die Entwickelung grosser Lymphdrüsengeschwülste am Halse; bei Verstopfung der oberen Hohlader livides Oedem des Gesichtes, des Halses, selbst der oberen Gliedmassen. Könnte im Anfang noch Zweifel bleiben, so würde ihn der rasche Verlauf bald heben.* Schon Dieffen- bach in seiner operativen Chirurgie hat sich im Jahre 1848 vom rein praktischen Standpunkte gegen die Operation des Krebskropfes au^esprochen. Seine Worte sind: »Wenn wir Alles, was wir aus den Werken der Schriftsteller über die Operation grosser, gleich- massig harter oder selbst scirrhöser Kröpfe wissen, nochmals über- blicken, so müssen wir mit Schaudern an diese tollkühnen Unter- nehmungen denken." Nichts ist im Stande gewesen, seine Meinung über die Verwerflichkeit der Exstirpation des harten und scirrhö- sen Kropfes wankend zu machen. Nur die Fälle der Struma glan- dolosa halt er nach seinen Erfahrungen für operabel, wenn sie nicht sehr gross, isolirt und beweglich sind. So steht also schon Dieffenbach auf demselben Standpunkte, welcher bis jetzt in die Neuzeit hinein galt; nur diejenigen Fälle von Kropf überhaupt wurden exstirpirt, dei'en Operation für das Leben ganz unnütz. In meinem Vortrag über den Kropftod und die totale Exstirpation der Kröpfe, der ganzen Schilddrüse, habe ich den entgegengesetz- 4 Dr. Edxn. Rose, ten Grundsatz ausgesprochen. Bei der Grefahr, welche selbst den unscheinbarsten Operationen an Kröpfen anerkanntermassen an- haftet, möchte man eher vor diesen Operationen warnen, deren Zweck doch höchstens ein kosmetischer sein kann. Umgekehrt sind es gerade die verpönten harten Kröpfe, welche unsere Thä- tigkeit herausfordern. Ich habe zu zeigen versucht, wie gerade diese harten Kröpfe zur entzündlichen Erweichung der Luftröhre und damit direct zum Tode fuhren. Die harten Kröpfe unter so verzweifelten Umstanden zu operiren, halte ich für Gewissens- pflicht. Die entzündliche Erweichung der Luftröhre beim Kropf ist das Analogon der Fibrintamponnade beim Croup; die Operation beider eine gleiche Pflicht für den Chirurgen. Für diese Fälle habe ich Ihnen vor einem Jahre*) die totale Exstirpation der Schilddrüse nach vorausgeschickter substrumöser Tracheotomie empfohlen und Ihnen zwei **) in dieser Weise einfach geheilte Fälle vorgestellt. Mit der richtigen Würdigung der Gefahr habe ich das Entsetzen vor der Operation verloren. Gilt das nun auch für die Operation des Krebskropfes in gleicher Weise , wie für den harten Kropf? Schon vor einem halben Jahre, wie Sie sich erinnern, habe ich Ihnen über die Exstirpation eines Krebskropfes •**) berichten können. nHerr Gemeinderath X. St. kann nur durch eine Operation vor dem bald sicher eintretenden ErstickungS' und Hungertode gerettet werden'', hiess es in dem Begleitschreiben des Hausarztes. In der That halte bei dem 56 Jahre alten Kranken, welcher von jeher einen Kropf gehabt , der ihm eng machte, seit dem Ende October 1876 sich ein rapides Wachsthum eingestellt, so dass es schon Ende März zu einem fast tödtlichen Erstickungsanfall kam. Das Schlimmste aber war, dass Patient bei seiner Aufnahme in das Zürcher Can- tonspital am 10. Aprü eigentlich schon seit 6 Wochen im Verhungern war. Festes konnte Patient schon längere Zeit nicht schlucken , und nur das ging hinunter, was yollstandig aufgeweicht werden konnte. Aber wie! Schluck für Schluck und dennoch mit stetem Verschluckem. Obgleich der Kranke an täglichen Wein* oder Schnapsgenuss gewöhnt, habe ich am 14. April die Exstirpation der sarcomatösen linken Kropfhälfte nach vorausgeschickter substrumöser Tracheotomie in der verengten Luftröhre vorgenommen. Die Vena jugularis communis wurde ganz unten unterbunden, •) Vgl. den Bericht über die cantonale Versammlung der Züricher Aerzte in Zürich den 13.

Ueber 82 Ligaturen blieben in derselben, welche durch die Ausdehnung der 48Ctm. im Längsumfang, 32 Ctm. im Breitenumfang betragenden, 2 Vj Pfd. schweren Geschwulst längs der Wirbelsaule eine mehr als beabsichtigte Grösse gewonnen hatte. Der erste £rfolg war nicht so übel, die Blutung stand ganz Tollstandig, die Warme des Körpers war eine ganz normale. Ein dankbarer Blick des Kranken dräckte seine Freude aus , als er zum ersten Mal wieder seit langer Zeit vor unseren Augen durch den nackt daliegenden Oesophagus in einem Zug ein ganzes Wasserglas voll Wein ohne abzusetzen hinunter- storzen konnte. Allein dieser Erfolg sollte nicht lange dauern. Ohne Spur einer Nachblutung oder ein sonstiges Ereigniss coUabirte der Kranke am an- deren Morgen. — Wider Erwarten ergab dann noch die Section , dass auch der zoruckgelassene unscheinbare rechte'' Lappen der Schilddrüse und einige kleine Drüsen unter der Bronchientheilung sarcomatös entartet waren. Ich musste danach schon damals zu dem Schluss kommen, dass sich wohl auch beim Krebskropf, wenn er durch Erweichung der Luftröhre Erstickungsanfälle setzt, die Exstirpation mit vor- ausgeschickter substrumöser Tracheotomie ausführen lasse, selbst wenn er weit unter das Brustbein reicht. Auf der anderen Seite bot der Fall ein grosses Interesse dar, weil er lehrte, dass unter Umstanden der Verhungerungstod als letztes Mittel die Kropf- exstirpation erfordern kann. Freilich musste man sich nun drittens sagen, dass dieser Verhungerungszustand bei einer so eingreifenden Operation, bei einem so beträchtlichen Alter, bei der Gewöhnung an Alcoholica gewiss sehr stark beim schliesslichen CoUaps des Kranken betheiligt war. Endlich aber lehrte der Fall gerade für unsere Frage hier, wie misslich es mit der Radicalcur des Krebs- kropfes ist. üeberzeugt, es mit einem primären, isolirten, abge- kapselten Kropfsarcom zu thun zu haben, gingen wir an das schwere Werk; die sauere Mähe wurde durch das Bewusstsein be- lohnt, alles Bösartige entfernt zu haben, und siehe da, wider Ver- muthen zeigten sich auch in der äusserlich scheinbar ganz gesunden Seite, ja in den unzugänglichen Bronchialdrüsen, die Anfange neuer Herde! Seitdem bin ich noch einmal in die Lage gekommen, des drohenden Hungertodes wegen zur Operation zu schreiten. Leider handelte es sich wieder um einen stark in Alcoholicis thätigen ^nn, einen Gastwirth yon 46 Jahren, der erst seit 7 Monaten die Entstehung eines Kropfes an seinem Halse bemerkt, ihn sofort mit allen möglichen Mitteln ^kämpft hat, jedoch vergeblich. Während er selbst um 25 Pfd. abgenommen, ^chs der Kropf stetig; eine Kur in Tölz war vergeblich, auch andere aus- 6 Dt. Edm. Rose, wältige Kliniker riethen zur Ezstiipatlon. Spät endlich entschloss er sielt dazu, oder yielmehr liess ihm die Familie seinen Willen, als er eben nur noch trinken nnd ganz aufgeweichte Brodbissen mit Unterbrechung und anter Schmer- zen nach mehrmaligem Ansetzen schliesslich hinunterschwemmen konnte. Ich entfernte ihm deshalb seinen grossen Kropf an der rechten Seite, der den Kehlkopf ganz nach links yersehoben hatte; zu meinem Erstaunen war er in einem fingerdicken, harten, entzündetem Bindegewebe eingebettet, so dass bei seiner Entfernung schon 87 Ligaturen sich in der Wunde angelegt fanden. Die biosgelegte Trachea öffnete ich in diesem Falle nicht , weil zwar etwas Dyspnoe, jedoch nie von hohem Grade existirt hatte, sich die blossgelegte Trachea nicht erweicht anfühlte und mit ihrer Rückkehr an die normale Stätte die leichte Athemnoth, hoffte ich, ganz verschwinden würde. Dagegen ver- anlasste mich der auffallende Befund bei der Operation, die ungewöhnlich starke Peristrumitis indurativa, ebenso wie der ganz ausserordentliche Blutreich- thum, der selbst capillar noch so stark war, dass ich mich gleich noch zur Tamponade mit Tanninsalicylwatte veranlasst sah, sofort nach der Exstirpa- tion dieser grösseren Kropfhälfte dazu, sie aufzuschneiden. Wie überrascht war ich, darin wieder eine bösartige Neubildung schon mit blossem Auge zu entdecken, ein alveolares Carcinom, wie die spätere Untersuchung ergab. Ich begnügte mich demnach also mit dem, was ich gemacht. Leider musste der Kranke nun noch obendrein nach der langen Narcose schwererbrechen, nichts- destoweniger ging es anscheinend am folgenden Tage ganz leidlich. Am dritten jedoch collabirte auch er, ohne dass trotz alles Erbrechens ein Tropfen nachgeblutet hätte. Gerade dieses nach solchen schweren Operationen so störenden Erbrechens wegen bin ich jetzt froh, in dem Apparat des Hm. Prof. Dr. Junker eine so wesentliche Erleichterung für die Narcose gefunden za haben. Gerade für die hier so bösartigen Narcosen bei Säufern und Kropf- kranken, bei der hier so starken Verbreitung fettiger Degenerationen am Herz- muskel, kann ich Ihnen diesen Apparat wegen seiner Ersparung an Chloroform gar nicht genug empfehlen. Was lehrte nun bei unserem Falle die Section? Neben exquisitem Hydrops der Pia, Fettleber und Fettherz fand sich auch in der scheinbar gesunden Seite der Schilddrüse ein Herd, vor Allem aber waren zahllose Knoten durch die Lungen verstreut. Obgleich der Kropf erst 7 Monate alt, obgleich keine Lymph- druse am Hals betheiligt, war dennoch also die Erebskrankheit generalisirt ; auch hier konnte also wieder von einer Radicalcor nicht die Bede sein. Und das schon bei einem Kranken, bei dem vor vollendeter Operation höchstens das schnelle Wachsen des Kropfes und gerade das Vorwiegen der Schluckbeschwerden allen- falls die Vermuthong der Krebsnatur hätten können aafkommen lassen. Sonst nichts, am wenigsten die äussere Beschaffenheit der Geschwulst selbst, die gar nichts Ungewöhnliches darbot. So haben Sie also hier 2 Beispiele, die recht charakteristisch die malignen Die Chirurg. Behandlung der carcinomaiösen Struma (des Krebskropfes). 7 Degenerationen des Kropfes, das eine für die Sarcome, das andere for die Cardnome, in klinischer Beziehung kennzeichnen! Beide Male haben wir es mit Neubildungen zu thun, die äusserlich noch so abgekapselt sind, wie irgend denkbar, wie sich es der Opera^ teor an allen anderen Orten nur irgend wünschen kann für seinen Erfolg. Von Aufbruch keine Rede, nirgends ist die Haut, die Mnsculatur verwachsen, im letzteren Falle ahnte noch Niemand in der Umgebung des Kranken etwas Böses von der Natur des Kreb- ses, — auch die Aerzte hielten sich für diese Annahme nicht b^ rechtigt — , und beide Male kommt der Chirurg trotzdem bereits mit der Operation zu spät. Ist es etwa stets der Fall, dass beim Krebskropf, so wie diese Diagnose wirklich vorher gestellt werden kann, der Chirurg bereits viel zu spät das Messer gebraucht? Die Exstirpation des Krebskropfes mit und ohne substrumöse Tracheo* tomie, je nach Bedürfniss, lässt sich ausfuhren, das leidet keinen Zweifel ; vielleicht werden die Verhältnisse nicht stets *) so ungünstig liegen, wie in den mitgetheilten 2 Fällen, wo der Verhungerungs- zustand mit dem Alcoholismns bei schon bestehender Generali- sation wetteiferten, die grosse Operation scheitern zu machen. Zwecklos jedoch wird eine solche stets bleiben, wenn es doch nicht gelingt, der Verbreitung der malignen Neubildungen im Kör- per zuvorzukommen. Dass sich diese auf die Dauer in ihrer Ver- breitung durch das Messer unterdrücken lassen, lehrt ja die Er- fahrung; sie würde es hier noch häufiger lehren, wenn uns auch allgemein sonst häufiger die primären Herde firühzeitig unter die Hände kämen. Die schlechten Erfolge der Krebsoperationen hän- gen in Bezug auf die Sadicalcur zweifellos auch sonst zumeist davon ab, dass die krebsige Natur des Leidens so oft viel zu spät erkannt wird. Wie steht es damit nun insbesondere bei unserem Fall? Zur Würdigung der Operation des Krebskropfes bleibt uns nichts Anderes übrig, als die eigene Erfahrung, die sparsamen Fälle, welche in der Literatur zugleich Verlauf und Section ergeben, Sie, verehrte Herren Collegen, zur gemeinsamen Berathung über die Frage heranzu- ziehen, wie erkennt man den Krebskropf vor der Generalisation ? Oder sollten unsere 2 Fälle am Ende nicht allein dastehen und sich gar zeigen, dass das operable Stadium des Krebskropfes nicht mit einiger Sicherheit erkennbar ist? dass man es höchstens einmal *) YgL den bekannten Fall von Schall. 8 Dr. Edm. Rose, durch Zufall trifft? Nach Lebert's und Lücke's Worten dürfte man das allerdings nicht vermuthen! Studiren wir also einmal die einzelnen Zeichen des Krebs- kropfes auf ihren Werth, nach dem geringen Material, das über- haupt existirt, nach den geringen Daten, die uns hier in Zürich darüber zugänglich sind. Die Tabelle, welche ich hier vor mir habe, enthält ausser den 7 genauer von mir beobachteten Fällen nur noch 17 andere, von denen mir ein grosser Theil auch nur in den Auszügen, die Lebert giebt, zugänglich war. Bei den ersten 12 von diesen Fällen wurden chirurgische Eingriffe gemacht, oft geringfügigster Art, wie z. B. eine Explorativpunction ; 10 davon überlebten den Eingriff, so weit die vorliegenden Notizen es zu berechnen gestatten, durchschnittlich nur 9 Tage 12 Stunden. Bei 7 von ihnen, bei denen ich darüber Anhaltspunkte für die Berech- nung finde, scheint die Dauer der ganzen Erebskrankheit 6,3 Mo- nate betragen zu haben. Bei den 12 anderen Fällen meiner Liste, wo gar nicht operirt wurde, scheint die Lebensdauer seit Beginn der Krankheit bis zum Tode sich auch nur auf 7,8 Monat erstreckt zu haben; die Extreme sind 9 Wochen und IV2 Jahr. Aus dem Unterschied beider Zahlen (6,3 dort, 7,8 hier) darf man jedoch nicht schliessen, dass die Verkürzung Folge der Operation gewesen ; man braucht bloss die Tabelle zu überblicken, um zu sehen, dass im ersten Dutzend gerade die Fälle sind, welche an örtUchen Ge- fahr drohenden Leiden zu Grunde gingen, während in diesem gerade solche sich finden, die ohne gefahrliche locale Complica- tionen einfach an allgemeiner Carcinose starben. Jedenfalls, wie dem nun auch sei, scheint sich doch gerade daraus zu ergeben, wie rapid im Allgemeinen der Verlauf des Krebskropfes ist. Wenn Lücke trotz der Bemerkung von Lebert von Jahre langem Ver- lauf des Krebskropfes sich überzeugt haben will, so habe ich hier in Zürich noch nichts davon gesehen. Ich bemerke beiläufig, dass alle 24 Fälle Carcinome in ihrer verschiedenen Art betreffen, bis auf 3 Fälle von mir, welche aus Sarcomen bestanden. Ich betrachte letztere nicht besonders, weil ich im Einzelnen nichts Abweichendes habe auffinden können. Auf der anderen Seite ist bekannt, zu welchem Umfang der Krebskropf fuhren kann, wenn auch freilich die Alibert'schen Riesenkröpfe nicht dieser Natur zu sein pflegen. Der Umfang und die kurze Dauer im Verein ergeben uns so aber, Die Chirurg. Behandlung der carcinomatösen Struma (des Krebskropfes). 9 das, wie mir scheint, beste Zeichen für den Krebskropf, nämlich die allwöchentlich messbare Umfangszunahme des Halses*). Wenn diese Zunahme stetig anhält, so wird dies Verhältniss kaum von einer rapiden Cystenentwickelung oder Strumitis erreicht. Dieser Cha- rakter ist um so auffallender, als der Erebskropf dabei subcutan zu bleiben pflegt, ja oft trotz allen Wachsthums, wie der Hoden- krebs in seiner Tunica albuginea, so in der Schilddrüsenkapsel ge- nügen bleibt Ich habe noch keinen Erebskropf gesehen, welcher vor dem Tode von selbst ulcerirt wäre, und in dem zweiten Dutzend von Fällen der Tabelle scheint auch kein solcher gewesen 2u sein. Im ersten dagegen sehen wir, wie fast regelmässig selbst dem unbedeutendsten Eingriff, sogar dem Wegebahnenden Explorativ- troicart, der Aufbruch und die Verjauchung folgt. Werden später die Cenricaldrüsen befallen, so scheinen sie meist mit der Schild- drüse in eine dem tastenden Finger untrennbare Masse zu ver- schmelzen. Wir trennen hier deshalb in der Betrachtung auch nicht Sarcome und Carcinome, da ihr klinisches Hauptunter- scheidungsmittel , die Gegenwart oder der Mangel distinct fühlbarer Drusenschwellungen, bei den malignen Kröpfen mich stets bis jetzt im Stich gelassen hat. Dazu kommt, dass es ohne Messer zu-' weilen nicht möglich ist, isolirte Eropfknoten, Nebenkröpfe von Lymphdrüsengeschwälsten, zu unterscheiden. Die seltenen Fälle, wo ich neben wachsenden Kröpfen Lymph- drusen isolirt vorfand oder entstehen sah, betrafen fast niemals maligne Eröpfe. Ich für mein Theil kenne kein Zeichen, welches für den Erebskropf so charakteristisch wäre, als das stete Wachsen einer subcutanen Struma; allein fragen wir uns nun umgekehrt, kann man darauf hin sein Frimärstadium schon diagnosticiren, so lehrt die Erfahrung mehrerlei Momente, wodurch dies Zeichen sehr verliert. Dass alte Eröpfe, auch ohne Strumitis und Cystenbildung, oft zeitweise plötzlich zu wachsen anfangen, ist bekannt. Wenn sonst kein Beweis vorliegt, kann man daraus allein nicht auf Krebskropf schliessen; nur das Anhalten des Wachsens ist bewei- send. Bei der kurzen Dauer der Erankheit und der Schnelligkeit der Generalisation — das lehrt der letzte Fall — versäumt man leider über dem Warten manchmal die richtige Zeit zur Operation. Und gerade in diesem Falle war der Umfang noch nicht ein so •) VgL den letzten FaU. 10 Dr. Edm. Rose, ansserordentlicher , dass er allein die Annahme eines Krebses ge- rechtfertigt hatte. Dazu kam noch ein zweiter Umstand, der mich im letzten Falle am meisten von dieser Annahme abgebracht hat. Das war die Wirksamkeit der inneren Mittel gegen diesen Kropf. Auch dieser Fall hat mir, wie mehrere andere*), gezeigt, dass selbst die carcinomatöse Form der Struma sich in Etwas von der gewöhnlichen Kropftherapie beherrschen lässt Es ist dieser Erfolg zweifellos, mit dem Centimeterband messbar, freilich aber vergäng- licher Natur, gerade aber doch gross genug, um bei Mangel son- stiger Anhaltspunkte den Arzt in der Diagnose einer cardnösen Struma irre zu machen. Gerade um an diesen Punkt zu erinnern, bediene ich mich stets in der Klinik des Ausdruckes Krebskropf, Struma sarcomatosa etc., und rede möglichst wenig von Carcino- men der Schilddrüse, weil ich mich überzeugt halte nach den Re- sultaten, welche die Messungen bei solchen therapeutischen Ver- suchen ergaben, dass meist mit der Entwickelung eines Krebsherdes der übrige Kropf in einfacher Weise mitwächst, wie die Scheiden- haut beim Hodenkrebs. Jedenfalls ist das sicher, dass ein Erfolg der Therapie, wie wir sie beim einfachen Kropf anwenden, beim Krebskropf diese Diagnose nicht widerlegt. Wird ein alter Kropf, der nie behandelt war, krebsig, so ist die Wirksamkeit des Jods beispielsweise nicht aufEedlend. Der Halsumfang schwindet durch die Jodwirknng , könnte man denken , indem das Fett und die alten Kropftheile abnehmen, trotz der Zunahme des Krebsknotens ; allein solche Fälle, wie der letzte, wo der Kropf überhaupt erst mit der Krebsentwickelung bemerkbar wird und doch die Jodtherapie eine zeitweilige Abnahme zeigt, scheinen dafür zu sprechen, dass die Krebsentwickelung die unbetheiligten Kropftheile zum Wachsen in ihrer Weise veranlasst, und dass diese hyperplastischen Neben- vorgänge trotz der Krebsentwickelung so stark vom Jod beeinflusst werden können, dass der ganze Krebskropf bei solcher Cur kleiner wird, freilich nur auf einige Zeit. Endlich giebt es noch einen dritten Punkt, der dies Cardinal- phänomen des Krebskropfes in seinem Werth sehr beeinträchtigt. Es unterliegt keinem Zweifel, dass man an primärem Krebskropf zu Grunde gehen kann, ohne dass der Kropf selbst bis zum Tode am Halse durchgefühlt werden konnte. ♦) Vgl. den FaU L ändert. Die Chirurg. Behandlung der carcinomatösen Stnuna (des Krebskropfes). 11 Einen solchen Fall habe ich selbst vor Jahren erlebt. Ich wurde bei Nacht in das Cantonspital gerufen, weil auf der inne- ren Abtheilung ein Kranker im Ersticken lag. Die ausgesprochen- sten Erscheinungen der Bronchostenose, wie bei einem Groupkind! Ein Kropf war nicht zu fühlen. Ein anderer Grund jedoch trotz lOtagiger Beobachtung auch nicht herauszubringen gewesen. Die Laryngotomie hatte keinen Erfolg, die Section zeigte, dass ein Erebskropf in der Tiefe des Halses sich ganz flach entwickelt hatte. Oben hatte er den Anfang der Speiseröhre durchwuchert, Longe und Zwerchfell waren mit Knoten übersäet. Die Todesursache jedoch war eine Wucherung, welche 4 Ctm. unter dem Ringknorpel sobstemal in die Trachea gedrungen und im Kampf mit meiner Tracheotomiecanüle zerfetzt, aber nicht hinlänglich zerstört war, om die Passage ganz frei zu machen. Also ein Erstickungstod in Folge eines nicht fühlbaren Kropfes und noch dazu eines bereits generalisirten Krebskropfes! Welch' Gegensatz zu der vulgären Meinung, als wären gerade die Riesenkröpfe carcinöser Natur! Wenden wir uns jetzt zu den sonstigen Zeichen, an denen man die maligne Natur der Tumoren zu erkennen pflegt, so treten nns in positiver und negativer Weise die Schmerzen entgegen. In der That sahen wir zuweilen heftige ausstrahlende Schmerzen be- sonders in das Ohr, den Nacken und den Arm auftreten, allein aasdrucklich erwähnt werden sie in den 24 Fällen meiner Tabelle nur 5 Mal. Dazu kommt, dass Kropfkranke ja auch sonst leicht neuralgische Schmerzen, wenigstens in die Ohr- und Nackengegend, bekommen, so z. B. schon manchmal nach einfachen parenchyma- tösen Jodeinspritzungen in Luton's Art Auf der anderen Seite pflegt der Krebs, so lange noch nicht die Haut mitbetheiligt, gegen Druck unempfindlich zu sein, und man ist geneigt, bei schnell wachsenden Strumen aus der Empfind- lichkeit auf entzündliche Vorgänge zu schliessen. Es ist bekannt, wie oft schon der Krebskropf punctirt worden ist, weil man glaubte, der empfindliche Tumor, der jetzt immer deutlicher fluctuirt, immer mehr vorspringt, immer empfindlicher und röther wird, könne gar nichts Anderes als einen Abscess, eine vereiterte Cyste dar- stellen, zumal wenn die Besitzer noch jung waren. Eine schnelle Verjauchung belehrt dur(fhschnittlich in 10 Tagen über den Irr- thun. Solche Verwechselungen kommen auch an anderen Theilen 12 Dr. Edm. Rose, vor. Wenn wir bei den localen Zeichen des Krebskropfes stehen bleiben, so liegt, wie an anderen Orten, die Gestaltung seiner Ober- fläche zu beachten nahe; die vielbuckelige Gestalt der Krebse ist ja sonst oft so durchschlagend. Davon ist hier natürlich auch nicht viel Einsicht zu erlangen, da beim einfachen Kropf so oft sich Knollen durch isolirte Hyperplasie und coUoide Degenerationen einerseits, durch die Jodinjectionen andererseits bilden. Lässt doch schon Virchow den Albers'schen**) Fall von scirrhösem Kropf, der sich dadurch besonders auszeichnete, gar nicht dafür gelten, sondern fand in ihm den gewöhnlichen Colloidkropf wieder! Mir ist es auch in einzelnen, durch die Section bestätigten Fällen gerade umgekehrt aufgefallen, wie durch das schnelle Wachsen sich die Geschwülste rund und glatt dabei gestalten. Die Weichheit, und zwar eine für den tastenden Finger oft herdweise an der glatten Oberfläche eindrückbare Beschaffenheit, eine verminderte Wider- standsfähigkeit des Krebskropfes am Halse des noch Lebenden ist mir mehrmals sehr auffaUig und charakteristisch***) vorgekommen. War andererseits der Krebskropf hart, so, zeigt Fall 8, ist es manchmal nur Folge einer stark entwickelten Peristrumitis indu- rativa. *) Ueber den Kropftod. Fall 3.

Behandlang der carcinomatösen Struma (des Krebskropfes). 13 Nach der Betrachtung der localen Zeichen, wollen wir jetzt dnen Blick auf die localen Folgen werfen! Wie verhalten sich die so wichtigen Halscanäle gegen den Erebskropf? Es ist mir im höchsten Grade angefallen, wie die Leiden der Speisewege so sehr ml mehr beim Krebskropf uns entgegengetreten, als die Beschwer- den der Luftwege oder die Folgen bei anderen Kropfarten. Der Erebskropf macht mit der Zeit auch Dyspnoe, ja Orthopnoe, allein man sieht sie recht oft wieder vergehen. Die Kranken gewöhnen sich bald an die manchmal ausserordentlichsten Verschiebungen der Luftwege. Eine entziindliche Luftröhrenerweichung mit oder ohne Stenose scheint bei Krebskropf sehr viel seltener vorzukommen, als bei anderen grossen Kröpfen, und rührt das wohl daher, dass in dem Alter, wo sich der Krebskropf entwickelt, meist schon das Halsskelet ganz rigide, verknöchert und deshalb schon ohnehin gegen den Andrang der noch dazu meist so weichen Krebsmasse mehr geschützt ist, als beim Kropf in der Jugend. Auf der an- deren Seite handelte es sich in den beiden Fällen von Krebskropf, die an Erweichung unter meinen Augen litten, notorisch um sehr alte Kröpfe, so dass diese Veränderung wahrscheinlich schon vor- lag oder im Gange war, als der Kropf krebsig wurde*). Dasselbe sdieint auch in den anderen, so seltenen Fällen der Literatur der Fall gewesen zu sein, welche an Tracheostenose beim Krebskropf gestorben sein sollen. Viel häufiger beruht die Athemnoth dabei auf anderen Umständen, zunächst der krebsigen Infiltration der Luftwege, die ihre Wandungen fixirt, steif macht, aber durch- gängig erhält, also keine Bronchostenose macht, falls sich nicht schon vor der Krebsentwickelung eine Kropfstenose vorfand. In anderen Fällen sehen wir metastatisch in den Lungen eine ganze Heerde Krebsknoten sich bilden und die Athemfläche immer mehr beschranken, jedoch ohne dass es auch hier gleich zu hochgradiger Dyspnoe, Erstickungsanfallen oder gar Asphyxie käme. Die schwersten Zufälle der Art habe ich nur in dem oben erwähnten Falle, wo ein Krebstumor fast die Lichtung der Luft- röhre ausfüllte, gesehen, so wie in einem zweiten, bei dem sich ein Krebsgeschwür (vielleicht in Folge der Kunsthfilfe) bildete, das stetig in die Lungen seinen Detritus entleerte. Umgekehrt wie die Luftwege verhalten sich die Speisewege. *) Ueber den Kropftod Fall 3. und der erste Fall oben (Fall 7). 14 Dr. £dm. Rose, Es ist ganz aufifallend und vielleicht charakteristisch, wie schwer die Emährang oft bei diesen Kranken leidet. Das Körpergewicht nimmt rapide ab, trotzdem die Leute wohl den besten Appetit haben. Allein die Kranken haben oft die ärgsten Stenosen. Es ist, als ob die Härte des senilen Halsskelets gerade besonders die Einwirkung des Krebses gegen die Speiseröhre lenkt. Unsere bei- den Kranken konnten nur noch Flüssiges und das schluckweise, zum Theil mit Hübe und Noth hinabbringen; hochgradige Schling- beschwerden werden in 18 Fällen meiner Tabelle 16 Mal beson- ders hervorgehoben, 2 Mal fehlen sie. Es finden sich da neben einander die Speiseröhre verdrängt, comprimirt, infiltrirt, usurirt, perforirt von Wucherungen. Auch der Decubitus durch das An- drängen des Kehlkopfes mit doppeltem Geschwür vorne und hinten am Pharynx, begleitet durch das Reiben beim Schlucken und Athmen, mit Vereiterung und Caries des Aryknorpelgelenkes und mit Knochenfrass der Wirbelkörper finden wir hier wieder, wie wir das schon früher von den Strumen überhaupt durch Gruveilhier kennen gelernt haben. Die Verdrängungen der Speiseröhre bei Kröpfen sind oft ganz merkwürdig; ich habe sie geradezu recht- winkelig geknickt gefunden; schon Bruns hat wegen Oesophagus- stenose beim Kropf eine nicht glückliche Oesophagotomie gemacht. Oft mnss man zum Catheterismus schreiten. Badical wirkt bei unheilbaren Tumoren natürlich nur die Exstirpation. Wie schön war danach bei dem ersten unserer Kranken, Herrn Gemeinderath JSteger, sofort der Erfolg; hätte er nur länger vorgehalten! Das anhaltende, unaufhaltsame Wachsthum neben der starken Dysphagie scheint mir fast das beste Zeichen des Krebskropfes zu sein. Zum Schluss bleibt mir nur noch übrig, in meiner Betrach- tung Zweierlei hervorzuheben. Zunächst das Alter. 40 — 60 Jahre ist das Alter der Kran- ken nach Lebert, der unter seinen 23 Fällen nur 3 unter 40 Jahren, von 35 Jahren bis 40 Jahre, fand, woneben ein 2jähriges Kind mit secundärem Schilddrüsenkrebs enthalten ist, nur 6 über 60 Jahre bis zu 91 Jahren. Allein schon Lücke hat ein Can- croid bei 36 Jahren, Frerichs ein Sarcom bei 37 Jahren, Bruns ein Mädchen von 27 Jahren, Billroth ein Mädchen von 25 Jahren mit Carcinom beobachtet Den jüngsten Fall erlebte Schuh bei einem ungarischen Dienstmädchen, welches nur 16 Jahre alt war. Die Chirurg. Behandlung der carcinomatösen Struma (des Krebskropfes)« 15 Mein jängster Erebskropffall war 38 Jahre alt. Das mitüere Alter der (25) FäUe in meiner Tabelle ist 53,7 Jahre. Auf der anderen Seite, wer wird zugeben, dass ein Wachsen der Struma an sich nach dem 40. Jahre allein schon die Erebsentwickelung beweist, sicherstellt, wie Lebert sagt? Denn wenn er hinzufugt das Mit- leiden der Gesundheit, Abmagerung, schlechter Teint, Verlust der Kräfte, schlechte Stimmung, schlaflose Nächte, so sind das ja alles notorisch unwesentliche Dinge, die sich ganz ebenso bei allen Kropf- kranken ohne Ausnahme finden, denen es an den Kragen zu gehen droht Die Compressionserscheinungen, die Configuration des Tu- mors, die Drüsengeschwülste, die Venenobturation, die er dann noch hinzulegt, haben wir schon gewürdigt, und theils nicht wichtig und beweisend genug gefunden, theils rerrathen sie eben das Generali- sationsstadium des Krebskropfes, bei dem unser Interesse mit der Handgreiflichkeit der Erscheinungen längst erschöpft ist Lebert's Symptomatologie lässt uns also trotz ihrer scheinbaren Sicherheit vollständig im Stich! Lücke hat sich vorsichtiger ausgedrückt, er basirt die Diagnose auf dem Wachsthum nach dem 85. Tage nnd den Drüsen. Wird dies Wachsen schmerzhaft, ohne Cysten- bildong zu zeigen, dagegen mit Drüsenschwellungen, so ist der Verdacht einer krebsartigen Neubildung gesichert Die Härte und Schlingbeschwerden fügt er hinzu. Die Härte haben wir nie charakteristisch gefunden. Die harten Kröpfe, die ich sah, sind meist durch die Lu ton 'sehen Inj ectionen gemacht üeber die Unsicherheit und Bedeutung der anderen Symptome haben wir uns ausgelassen. Es bleibt zum Schluss nur seine Angabe zu betrachten, dass sich keine Cystenbildung beim Wachsen zeigen darf, um die Krebsdiagnose zu sichern. Dass diese Behauptung gerade sehr irrig und zu grossen Täuschungen fahren kann, damit will ich hier meine Erörterung schliessen. Unter den 12 Fällen meiner Tafel, in denen ich oder andere ab- sichtlich oder unabsichtlich zu Operationen beim Krebskropf ver- anlasst wurden , befinden sich 2 Fälle von Laryngotomie, die jedes )Ial Erstickung halber bei unfuhlbarem oder sehr kleinem Kropf gemacht wurden, und scheiterten, weil der Krebskropf die Luft- röhre durchwuchert hatte. In 5 Fällen wurde (die 2 von mir mitgerechnet) die Zerstörung oder Exstirpation von vorneherein beabsichtigt In 2 von diesen und den 5 anderen Fällen hat man 16 Jh. Edm. Rose, (und zwar Lücke, Billroth, Schuh, Poamet, Demme and ich) zuerst mit einer Cyste zu thun gehabt oder geglaubt zu thun zu haben. Dass in der Praxis gewiss oft genug gerade bei der so tauschenden Pseudofluctuation gewöhnlicher Strumahyperplasieen, noch mehr aber der Krebskröpfe, zur Explorativpunction , wie es hinterher heisst, geschritten wird, kann man wohl mit Sicherheit annehmen. Dass oft genug diese Punction, wenn sie in einen ab- gekapselten Knoten hinein stattfindet, nicht gleich zur allgemeinen Verjauchung fuhrt*), sondern nur aus dem Knoten eine Art Brei- cyste nach Art des Bühring'schen, von Billroth aufgenom- menen Operationsplanes, der subcutanen Zerreissung einfacher Kropf- knoten, macht, ist wohl glaublich. Etwas Aehnliches ist vielleicht (?) in einem von mir beobachteten und dem Lücke 'sehen Falle ge- schehen, wo nach von anderer Seite vorausgeschickten fruchtlosen Punctionen Lücke durch den Schnitt gelbröthliche, fadenziehende Flüssigkeit und dann braunrothe und gelbliche bröckelige Massen entleerte. In einem Falle, der mir dann in^s Spital geschickt wurde, hatte die vor- ausgeschickte Panction eine Jaucheentleerende Fistel zur Folge, die mich zur Spaltung veranlasste, wobei sich dann theilsCoagula, theils gangränöse Fetzen, theils verkalkte Massen aus der Höhle entfernen liessen. Trotz der Entspan- nung griff die Eiterung um sich, was uns schon stutzig machte; die Kranke coUabirte und die Section erwies als Basis ein verjauchendes Sarcom.

Article: Auch von den in der Retina ublauf enden Processen haben wir einen zu erwähnen, welcher ebenfalls mit einer spasmotischen Myosis einhergeht, die allerdings einen anderen Grund hat als die soeben besprochene ; sie beruht auf Reizung des pupillen verengern- den Oentrums und schliesst sieh somit an die früher erwähnten Formen an. Bei Retinitis pigmentosa fand Mooren (lieber Reti* — 89 - Ditis p^^estosa. Zekender^s klin. Mtsbl. I, p. 93—106) eine etwas engere vordere Kammer mil; leicht oontrahirter Pupille, während Haase (Retinitis pigmentosa mit Hyperaesthesia retinae, ibid. Y, p. 228—229) die Papillen zwar von normaler Weite, aber von träger Reaction sah. Auch Leber gibt an (Graefe und Saemiseh, Handbuch etc. Y, p. 649), dass die PupUlen bei Tageslicht von mittlerer Weite oder etwas verengt, niemals stark dilatirt seien, und an einem anderen Orte (Arch. f. Ophth. XYII, 2, p. 314—341) , dass die PupUlar- reaction niemals vollkommen fehle, in, der Regel aber sehr träge sei. Diese bei Retinitis pigmentosa vorkommende Myosis erklärt Mooren (1. c.) als eine Folge der bei dieser Krankheit vorhandenen Hyperästhesie der Retina, wodurch das pupillenverengernde Centrum selbst bei schwacher Beleuchtung des Auges in beständiger starker Erregmig erhalten werde. Eine häufiger — alleinlings fast ausschliesslich bei extra- ocularen AfFeetionen ^- vorkommende Form von Myosis ist die paralytische, durch Lähmung der pupillenerweiternden Fasern be- dingte, deren Charakter wir bereits kennen. Dieselbe wird überall dort auftreten, wo die Continuität zwischen pupillenerweiterndem resp. vasomotorischem Centrum und Iris an irgend einer Stelle unterbrochen wird. Dies geschieht in erster Linie bei allen den- jenigen spinalen Processen, welche oberhalb der beiden obersten Drustwirbel bis zur Medulla oblongata hinauf localisirt sind und zugleioii diesen Abschnitt des Rückenmarkes entweder ganz oder wenigstens an denjenigen Th^len ausser Function setzen, welche zu den pupillencrweiternden Fasern in Beziehung stehen. Dem- nach muss eine Yerletzung des Ualsmarkes jedesmal eine paraly- tische Myosis bedingen, wie in dem bereits (S. 31) erwähnten Fallo von Rüssel (Med. Times and gaz. vol. XLI, p. 392), wo ein Naeiitwandler, der sich durch einen Fall von der Treppe eine voll- ständige Trennung zwischen siebentem Halswirbel und erstem Brustwirbel zugezogen hatto^ während seines noch sechs Tage dauernden Lebens Pupillen zeigte, die bei Lichteinfall fast so klein wie eine Nadelspitze waren und bei Beschattung nur sehr wenig sich vergrösserten. Die hintere Hälfte des Rückenmarkes fand sich an der verletzten Stelle blutig erweicht, während die angren- zenden Partien n^iss&rben und blutgetränkt erschienen. Ebenso ist die paralytische Myosis als sogenannte Spinalmyosis ein fast n ~ 90 — r0g^lmtt89iger Begleiter "von entzündlicben BSckennMufcsaSaetioflen, vorzugsweise der ehronisdi^i Forznen. Bei der grauen Degene- ration der hinteren Rückenmarksstränge bemerkt man, nach Ba ebl- m a n n (Sammig. klm. Y ortr. Nr. 1 85, p. 8) gewöhnlich sdion sehr frühzeitig, oft zuerst nur auf einer Seite, PupHlenverengerungi ver- bunden mit vasomotoriachen Lähmungserscheinungen auf der be- treffenden Kopfhälfte, wahrend später auch die andere Pupille myotisch wird. xVrgyll Robertson (1. c.) gibt an, dass bei spinaler Myosis die Reaotipn der Pupille auf Lieht aufgehoben sei, während die Contraction derselben auf Accommodationsimpulse prompt erfolge. Allerdings zeigte sich bei den von ihm veröffent- lichten fünf Fällen von Tabes dorsalis (Annales d^oculistique, T. 63, p. 113 — 127 et T. 64,. p. 16 — 33) neben einem erheblichen Grad von Myosis (^durchschnittlich 1 — 2 mm. Pupillen weite) diese Reactionslosigkeit der Pupille auf Licht im Gegensatz zu der prompten Accommodationsbewegung der Iris. Auch Knapp (Augenärztliche Reisenotizen. Arch. für Augen- und Ohrenheilk. II, 2, p. 191— 196) überzeugte sich in einem Falle Bobertson^s von spinaler Myosis von der Richtigkeit dieser Thatsache, ebenso in einem anderen Falle von Verletzung des Rückenmarkes durch einen Stich in den Nacken, wo die Pupillen eng und ohne ReactioD auf Lichtwechsel waren. Desgleichen haben Leber (Yirchov- Hirsch's Jahresber. f. 1872, p. 574), Nagel (Jahr^ber. f. Opbth. f. 1872) u. A. jene Beobachtung Robertson's bestätigen können. Zur Erklärung dieser anscheinend merkwürdigen Thatsache nimmt Robertson an, dass die ciliospinalen Fas^n einen Theil der YerbinduBgskette zwischen Retina und Pupille Ulden und dass die Pupillenverengerung auf Lichteinfall normaler Weise nicht auf einfacher Reflexthätigkeit beruht, sondern vielmehr durch normale zeitweise Refiexlähmung zu Stande komme. Knapp (1. c.) machte nun auf diese Hypothese hin Experimente an ELaninchen, gelangte aber insofern zu negativen Resultaten, als er nach Durchsohneiduog des Rückenmarkes zwischen 5. und 6. Halswirbel zwar Yerenger- ung der Pupille erhielt, aber die Beweglichkeit auf Liohteinfall erhalten fand, woraus er sehloss, dass das Oentmm der Reflexbe- wegung auf Liehtreiz oberhalb des 5. Halswirbels lieg^i mflsse. Auch Hempel (Ueber die Spinalmyosis. Arob. f. Ophth. XXII, 1, p. 1—28) bestätigte die Beobachtung Rober taon's betrefis ii» — 91 — Usbewof liolikeit der Pa^leü auf LxehteiBfoU bd eriialteiter h^ woglicfakeit auf Accommodatiosaimpalse. Wie bereits früher (8. 53) bemerkt, steht dies Fehlen der PupiUarreaetion iadess mit der spinalen Affection, d. h. der Läh- mung der pupiUenerweiternden Fasern selbst, in keinem Zusammen* hange und ist immer auf eine die Lähmung dieser cam- plioirende Lähmung im Oebiete der pupillenver* engernden Fasern zu beziehen, die durch ein Weitergreifen des gewöhnlich aufsteigenden sclerotisohen Processes auf die Ur- q>nuigBgegend dieser Fasern bedingt ist. W^er nicke (Das Ver- halten der Pupille bei Geisteskranken. Yirch. Arch. LYI, p« 397 407), dem Hempel (1. c.) sich anschliesst, nimmt an, dass bei spinaler Myosis diese Complication in einer Leitungsuuter- bveohung der Nervenbahn zwischen Opticus und Oculomotorius- centrnm bestehe, da dieses letztere selbst sich intakt zeige, was durch die prompte Beaction auf Accommodationsimpulse bewiesen, werde, und in der That muss man demzufolge wohl der begleiten- den Affeetion diesen Sitz anweisen. Dass aber die Reactionslosig- keit der Pupille eine Complication der spinalen Myosis ist und auf einem Weitergreifen des Processes nach dem Centrum zu beruht^ beweisen die Yon Hempel (1. c.) angeführten Fälle von Tabes (Nr. 12, 14 und 15), wo, wenn auch träge, Beaqtion auf Licht vorhanden war^ einmal (Nr. 14) bei beiderseits „auffallend engen ^ Pupillen. In den Fällen hingegen, wo bei mangelnder Beaction auf Licht, also bei gleichzeitiger Lähmung der pupillenverengem- den und pupillenerweitemden Fasern, — wodurch doch eine mitt- lere Pupillenweite bedingt sein müsste — Myosis und zwar oft hoohgradige , vorhanden ist, tritt nach Hempel „eine secun- däre Contraktur des Sphincter pupillae*^ hinzu. Indess kommen nach Foerster (Graefe und Saemisch, Handbuch etc. YU^ 1, 34) audi massig weite, starre Pupillen bei Tabes vor, die demnach wohl auf Lähmung beider Arten von Fasern ohne gleich- zeitige Sphittotercontraktur zu beziehen sind. Wir haben es bei Formen v(m rein spinaler Myosis also nur mit einer mittleren Yereogerung der Pupille zu thun, wobei die Beaction auf Licht sowohl als auf Accommodationsimpulse er- halten ist. Diese Form tritt indess nur im Anfangs* resp. in dem der Tabes auf, wo der Process nodi nicht über das ver- — 92 — muthüch in der Medolla oblongata gelegene pnpillenerweiterBde Centrum nach aufwärts hinans sich erstreckt, andrerseits aber die Begio ciliospinalis bereits befallen hat, also bei der sogenannten Tabes cervicalis. Hempel (1. c. p. 19) s^, die Yerengerong der Pupille bei spinaler Myosis sei die Folge Yon Lähmung des Oentrums für ihre Erweiterung in der MeduUa oblongata; indess ist es wahrscheinlich, dass jeder spinale Process oberhalb der beiden untersten Halswirbel, also vom Budge 'sehen Centrum ciliospinale bis zur MeduUa oblongata hin, ganz den gleichen Effect hat. Beider progressiven Paralyse, zu der sich in den spateren Stadien, oft auch schon früher, tabetische Erscheinungen hinzn- gesellen, wird man ebenfalls diese spinale Myosis finden. Baehl- mann (1. c. p. 6) glaubt die enge Pupille bei Dementia paraly- tica auf eine Herabsetzung der Corticalfunktionen zurückführen zu sollen. Hier werd^a wir indess noch weniger eine rein paraly- tische Form der Myosis erwarten dürfen, als bei der Tabes, viel- mehr wird bei der Paralsye in der Begel die Lichtreaction schon früh fehlen, weil der dieselbe aufhebende cerebrale Process meist den spinalen Erscheinungen voraufgeht. Ebenso meint Richarz (Ueber Verschiedenheit der Grösse der Pupillen aus centraler Ur- sache. Allg. Zeitschr. f. Psychiatrie Bd. XV, p. 21 ff.), dass bei allgemeiner Paralyse überhaupt es meistens geboten sei, die dureh Xrampfform bedingten Pupillenveränderungen lEiuszuscheiden, und will demnach die bei dieser Krankheit auftretende Myosis durch Lähmung der pupillenerweitemden Fasern erklärt wissen. Ob in- dess jede bei der progressiven Paralyse vorkommende Pupillen- verengerung einzig und allein auf eine Lähmung zurückzuführen ist, müssen die Fälle von maximaler Pupillenverengerung „bis zur Stecknadelkopfgrösse^ (Nasse, Allg. Zeitschr. f. Psychiatrie Bd. XXV, p. 665—684 und Jehn, ibid. Bd. XXX, p. 538) oder „fast bis zum Punktförmigwerden** (Westphal, Griesinger's Arch. f. Psychiatrie u. Nervenkrankh. I, p. 51) doch etwas zweifelhaft er* scheinen lassen. Man könnte allerdings denken, dass zu einer ein- fachen Myosis hier eine Contraktur des Sphincter pupillae hinza« gekommen sei. Im hyperämischen Anfangsstadium der progressiren Paralyse haben wir nun in der Begel auch eine Myosis, welche, wenn sie eine paralytische wäre, nie im späteren Stadium der ^ - 98 - Krankheit einer maximalen Erweiterung der Papille Platz machen könnte. Die Pupillenweite ist aber namentlich bei dieser Geistes* krankfaeit äusserst inconstant. Seyffert (I. c.) sah nur in vier Fällen die Myosis durch die ganze Dauer der Krankheit fort- bestehen, und Jehn (1. c.) sagt: ,, Wollte man durchaus etwas für die Paralyse gewissermaassen Charakteristisches in dem Verhaltea der Pupille anführen, so wäre es höchstens die meist übermässige Erweiterung einer in bedeutenderem Contraste zu der oft steck- nadelkopfgross verengten zweiten als man es bei anderen Arten psychischer Erkrankungen findet**. Damach hätten wir vielmehr die im Exaltationsstadium der Paralyse auftretende Pupillen Ver- engerung als eine spasmotische aufzufassen. Wahrscheinlich kommen eben im Verlauf der progressiven Paralyse alle Complicationen von Reizung und Lähmung der pupillenverengernden und pupillen- erweiternden Fasern vor, denn nur auf diese Weise wird die Man- nigfaltigkeit der Pupillarerscheinungen erklärlich. Dass den ein- zelnen Stadien jedoch bestimmte Pupillarerscheinungen entsprechen, ist zu vermuthen, obwohl dies bisher noch nicht erwiesen ist. Ein solcher Nachweis wäre indess sehr erwünscht, da man dann viel- leicht umgekehrt die jedesmalige Pupillen- Weite und Beaction zur Diagnose des Stadiums der Krankheit verwerthen könnte. Für die acute Manie, welche gewöhnlich mit Pupillenerweite- rnng einhergeht, gibt Seiffert (1. c. * an, dass, sobald sich die- selbe mit Myosis complicirt zeige, man den früheren oder späteren Eintritt der allgemeinen Lähmung mit ziemlicher Sicherheit pro- gnostiren könne; es handelt sich demnach auch hier zweifellos um eine Lähmnngsmyosis. In ihrer reinen Form tritt uns ausser bei den Rückenmarks- Verletzungen die paralytische Myosis noch bei der auf den Halstheil fortschreitenden Myelitis entgegen, meist nach vorausgegangener Reizongsmydriasis, welch letztere noch auf der einen Seite fort- bestehen kann, während auf der anderen bereits Mvosis vorhanden ist. Raehlmann (1. c. p. 7) sagt nun, wohl gestützt auf die Unter- suchungen von Schiff und Foa, dass die Myosis „als direktes Symptom vorhandener Rückenmarkskrankheiten und zwar nur der Hinterstränge zu betrachten und als solches für die Differenzial- diagnose wichtig^ sei. Dies letztere ist jedoch nicht richtig, da die paralytische Myosis oft ein Symptom der Poliomyelitis anterior - 94 - c]»?oiiioa ist, welche als progroistve MuskelatropMe gewohnlieh zu* erst in die Erscheiiinng tritt. Hier migt mdk die Myodis jiedoch nur in den Fällen, wo die Affection attf das sog. Bodge^scfae €entruin ciliospinalel des Halsmarks übergegriffen hat. Die Xyosis kann auch bei der Poliomyelitis anterior acuta eintreten und nicht minder bei der multiplen Sclerose des Gebims und Rückenmarks, welche Affection indess eben so gut Ursache zu einer paralytischen Myosis (Leube, Deutsches Arch. f. klin. Med. VIII, p. 1*19, Fall 2) als zu einer paralytischen Mydriasis werden kann, je nachdem ein sclerotischer Herd sich im Ghebiet der pupillenerwei- temden oder der pupillenverengemden Fasern localisirt. Tritt bei der Bulbärparalyse paralytische Myosis auf, so ist die Krankheit gewöhnlich mit progressiver Muskelatrophie oder mit Sclerose des Hirns und Rückenmarks complicirt. Endlich können noch Tumoren an der bezeichneten Stelle des Rückenmarks paralytische Myosis bedingen und zwar sowohl direkt doroh Compression der pupillenyerengernden Fasern, als indirekt durch eine secundäre Compressionsmyelitis. Auch die Spinalapo- plexie, welche mit Vorliebe den Halstheil der Medulla spinalis be- fallt, führt oft zu paralytischer Myosis, während die Meningeal- blutung in der Regel mit Reizerscheinungen, also eventuell mit Pupillenerweiterung einhergeht. Bei der Verengerung der Pupille während der Athempause des Cheyne-Stockes'schen Respirationsphänomens haben wir es nach den Angaben Leube 's (Berl. klin. Wochenschr. 1870, Nr. 15) und G. Merkel' s (Deutsches Arch. f. klin. Med. X, p. 201—205) ebenfalls mit einer paralytischen Myosis zu thun, bedingt durch eine mit der Lähmung des Respirationscentrums verbundene Para- lyse resp. Parese des pupillenerweiternden Centrums in der Medulla oblongata. Diese verminderte Erregbarkeit d^r beiden Oentren hat nach Leube ihren Grund in der mangelhaften Sauerstoffznflihr zur Medulla oblongata, sodass die Erregung immer erst duroh An- häufung einer gewissen Menge von Kohlensäure im Blute zu Stande kommen kann : mit dem Eintritt der Respiration erfolgt dann gleich- zeitig auch eine Erweiterung der Pupille. Diese Erklärung er- aohrint allerdings sehr plausibel, nur stimmt damit nicht, dass Leube sowohl wie Merkel die Pupille mit der Verengernng in der Athempause zugleich reactionslos gegen Licht sahen. — »5 — wäfar^id, in dem Merkel' sehen Falle wenigstens, die Reaetion init dem ersten Athemzuge und der Erweitemng der Pupille sich wieder herstellte. Man muss demnach doch wohl, was Lenbe auch bereits andeutet, auch an eine Esr^ung des pupillenver- engemden resp. des Oculomotorius-Centrums in der Athempause denken, zumal da gleichzeitig mit der Verengerung der Pupille pendelnde Bewegungen des Augapfels eintraten. Adamük (Central- blatt f. die med. Wissensch« 1870, Hr. 5) sah dieselben Erscheinungen nach Reizung der Yierhügel, und es ist daher möglich, dass die Verengerung der Pupille, wenn auch nicht allein, so doch mit auf einer Reizung des „motorischen Augencentrums^ beruht, veranlasst durch die mangelhafte Zufuhr ron arteriellem Blute zum Gehirn, wodurch nach den Versuchen von Kussmaul und Tenner (Würzb. Verhandlungen, Bd. VI, p. 40 u. 41) die genannten Er- scheinungen hervorgerufen werden können (cf. S. 58). Der Zusam- menhang dieser Bewegungen ist indess noch ebensowenig vollständig aufgeklärt wie die Beziehungen zwischen dem pupillenerweitemden und dem pupiUenverengernden Centrum. V. Graefe bezog auch die von ihm im Stadium aigidum der Cholera (Areh. f. Ophth. XII, 2, p. 198-211 » beobachtete Pupillen- verengerung auf eine abgeschwächte Leitung im Centrum cilio- spinale und stellte sie in gleiche Linie mit der Parese der sympa- thischen Herzinnervation , da zu gleicher Zeit mit dem höchsten Grade der Herzschwäche die Pupillen sich in der Regel am stärk- sten contrahirt fanden. Ob die Ursache hierfür in der Etndickung des Blutes oder in der direkten Einwirkung des Cfaoleragiftes auf das Centrum liege, lässt er uoentschieden; wahrscheinlich ist eben- falls hier die in Folge der Bluteindickung erschwerte resp. ver- minderte Blutzufuhr zur Medulla oblongata im Verein mit der theils durch den verlangsamten Kreislauf, theils durch die Ver- änderung der Blutbesehaffenheit selbst herbeigeführten, ungenügen- den Decarbonisation des Blutes die Ursache der endlichen Lähmung der Medulla oblongata und mit ihr des pupillenerweitemden Cen- trums; Nach Hirschler (Arch. f. Ophth. XVII, 1, p. 229) tritt zu der Alkoholamblyopie häufig eine, je nach dem Grade der Er- krankung mit mehr oder weniger ausgielnger Beweglichkeit ver- bundene Verengerung der Pupille hinzu. Dass diese Mjosis eine - 96 — paralytiacbe ist, scheint daraus henrormgeben; dass der gesaimte Autor sie auch bei acuter AlkohelintoxicatioB mit tödtlichem Aus- gang im Gefolge von Symptomen beobachtet hat, ,,die es nicht zulässig erscheinen lassen, die Yerengerung der Pupille yon einem Reizzustande des Gehirns ableiten zu wollen/ Die Pupillenver- engerung steht mit der Amblyopie gewiss in keinem direkten Zu- sammenhange , da man sonst vielmehr eine geringe Erw^terang erwarten müsste, welche sich in der That auch häufig zeigt. Man hätte denmach wohl zur Erklärung dieser Pupillenverengerung an eine Affection zu denken, die vielleicht in der Medulla oblosgata oder im Halsmark ihren Sitz hat, möglicherweise an eine fettige Degeneration einzelner Theile dieser Gegeud, wie Er is mann (Ueber Intoxicationsamblyopie. Inaug. Diss. Zürich 1867) und Leber (Arch. f. Ophth, XV, U, 236—247) sie am Sehnervenstamm gefunden haben. Weiterhin wird paralytische Myosis alle Lähmungen des Hal»- sympathicus, sowohl des Grenzstranges selbst, als seiner aus den unteren Hals- und oberen Brustnerven hervorkommenden Wurzeln, begleiten. Die Myosis, welche bei diesen Affectionen auftritt, be- ruht nach Nicati (La paralysie du nerf sympathique cervical. Diss. inaug. Zürich 1873, p. 24) auf einer unvollständigen Läh- mung des Dilatator pupillae, sodass auf Atropinisirung der Pupille fast maximale Mydriasis erfolgt; indess gilt dies wohl nicht allge- mein, wie u. A. der von Keuling (Arch. f, Augen- u. Ohrenheilk. IV, 1, 117 — 118) mitgetheilte Fall beweist, wo bei Verletzung der linksseitigen pars cervicalis N. sympathici das linke Auge eine „bis zur Stecknadelkopfgrösse contrahirte, gegen Lichteindruck voll- ständig unbewegliche Pupille^ zeigte. „Dass die Pupille ad maxi- mum contrahirt war, beweist der Umstand, dass ein eingelegtes Calabarscheibchen keine weitere Contraction zu veranlassen ver- mochte^. Durch Atropin wurde die Pupille in IV^ Stunden „bis zum Durchmesser des normalen Auges*' ausgedehnt. Es kommt eben auf den Sitz der Affection an, darauf, ob nur einige oder alle pupillenerweitemden Fasern gelähmt sind; im letzteren Falle wird man zwischen der Myosis bei spinalen Erkrankungen und der bei Sympathicuslähmungen keinen Unterschied in der Weite der Pupille bemerken. Ist die Ursache der Lähmung unter- halb der Gegend der beiden oberen Brustwirbel gelegen, so werden — 97 — von S^ten der FapiBe gar keiae Symptome ¥orhai(id«s s^, während }»ä. höherem Sitz der AffectioB, an Stellea, wo b^eits alle pupiUen- ßrweitemden Fasern in den Grenzi^Mig des Sympathions einge« treten smd, die paralytische Myosis eine yollstandige sein wird. Es bleibt jedoch noch fraglich, ob auch beim Menschen bei Läh- mung des Halssympathieus oberhalb des sechsten Halswirbds oder gar oberhalb des obere^n Halsganglions sämmtliche pupillener« weitemden iN^ervenfasem ausser Funktion gesetzt werden, da es noch nicht entschieden ist, ob die Iris nicht noch erweiternde Fasern vom Kopftheil des Sympathicus aus durch den Trigeminus zuge* fütirt erhalt, wie Schiff dies aus Yersuchen an Eatz^i zu schliessen geneigt ist (cf. S. 32). Verletzungen, vorzüglich Continuitatstrennungen des Sym- pathieus an den genannten Stellen disponiren demnach in erster Linie zu paralytischer Myom. So sah Seeligm aller (B^l. klin. Wocbenschr. 1870, No. 26) einmal nach Verletzung des Plexus brachialis die Pupille der afficirten Seite um die Hälfte kleiner, als die normale der anderen, an manchen Tagen sogar „bis auf die Grösse eines grösseren Stecknadelkopfes*^ contrahirt, während in einem anderen Falle, wo vom Plexus brachialis aus der N. ulnaris in Folge einer Schusaverletzung am Hake gelähmt war (Berl. klin. Wochenschr. 1872, No. 4) der Durch- messer der kranken zu der gesunden Pupille sich wie 2 : 3 ver- hielt; bei Beschattung gestaltete sich das Verhältniss hingegen wie 1:2. Bernhardt (ibid. No. 47 u. 48) fand in einem ana- logen Falle die Pupille bedeutend kleiner, als die des andere^i Auges. Die Beaction auf Licht war in allen diesen Fällen vor- handen, wenn auch weniger prompt^ als am gesunden Auge. £s bestand denmacb eine unconiplicirte paralytische Myosis, während in dem soeben erwähnten Falle von Reuling (1. o.) maximale Myosis mit allen ihren Characteren, sowie eine Verziehung der Pupille von unten und innen nach oben und aussen bestand ; hier war offenbar eine Complication vorhanden, wahrscheinlich eine secundäre ungleichmässige Contractur des Sphincter, da sich auf Atropineinträufelung die Pupille bis zur normalen Grösse erweiterte. Aehnliche Fälle sind von Bärwinkel (Deutsches Arch. f. klin. Med. XIV, p. 545), Ogle (Medice- chirurg. Transactions XII, p. 398) tt. A. beschrieben worden. Leesttr, Papillarbewegung. 7 ^ m ^ ^enso wie Yerletzimgeii können d«ii Halwympatlneus com* primirende Geschwülste, neben einer Drueklähmung des Nerven, ^e paralytische Myosis bewirken. Gar nicht selten fiadet man daher bei Aneurysmen der Carotis^ des Trunons anonymn^ oder auch der Aorta eine Lahmungsmyoeis. v. Willebrand theilie einen Fall mit (Arch. f. Ophth. I, 1, 319—322), wo durch Druck eines verhärteten Lymphdrusenpacketeis auf den Oervicaltheil des Sympathicus neben einer Neuralgie des N. ulnaris eine im böehsteD Grade verengte Pupille vorhanden war, die beim Wechsel von Licht und Schatten unbeweglich blieb; wahrscheinlich bestand hier ebenfalls Sphiootercontractur. Als nach eingeleiteter Be* handlung die Lymphdrüsen abschwollen, verschwand auch die Yerengerung und mit ihr die Unbeweglichkeit der Pupille. Auch dieser Fall liefert einen Beweis gegen die Behauptung Nicati'.s. dass bei spinaler Myosis immer eine stärkere Yerengerung der Pupille vorhanden sei, als bei Sympathicusaffectionen. Ogle (1. c.) sah Myosis in Folge einer grossen Krebsgeschwulst in der linken Cervicalgegend , und Heineke (Greifs walder med. Bm- träge, II* Heft t) fand ebenfalls bei einem kindskopfgrossen , die ganse linke Ualsseite einnehmenden Carcinom die linke PufHlle auüallend stark verengt. Auch sind Fälle bekannt, wo sich ^ne grosse Struma als Ursache der Myosis vorfand (Jany, Brünicke« nach Raehlmann, 1. c. p. 10). Sodann finden wir bei einer Erkrankung, welche mit Wahr- scheinlichkeit in einer SympathicusafFection ihren Grund hat, der Hemicrania sympathico-paretica, während der Anfalle und nach Fraenkel (Zur Pathologie des Halssympathicus. Inaug. Diss. Bres* lau 1874) schon gleich mit Beginn derselben die Pupille auf der leidenden Seite verengt. Nach 'Berg er (Frank el, 1. c. p. 7) sind die Pupillen fast unbeweglich gegen Tageslicht, wogegen Fraenkel in Uebereinstimmung mit Nicati (1. c. p. 24: „riris reagit k tous les agents possibles^) lebhafte Verengerung auf Licht* reiz emtreten sah, während die Erweiterung der Pupille auf Be- schattung nur träge von Statten ging. Das vorwaltende Symptom bei dieser mit intensiven Schmerzen verbundenen Krankheitsform ist eine „Anenergie im Gebiete des Ualssympathicus^, mithin u. A. auch eine Erweiterung der Gefässe an der betreffenden Kopf- hälfte etc., während die sympathico-tonische Form der Hemicranie — »9 -^ ttngekehrt mit der Yermigeriuig der Oefiune uad Brwetierung d«r Puptlie eiiihergeht. EioMst wahrscheinlieh hiesfaer gehörigen Fall beobaehtete Uorner (Zefaend. klin. Monafsbl. YII, p. 193 — 196) an einer 40 jahrigen Frau, die von Jugesd auf an Kopfschmerzen gelitten bMe und 6 Wochen nach dem letzten Wochenbette rechterseits eine unToUständige Ptosis mit charaeteriatiseher paralytischer Myosis aquirirt hatte. Die rechte Pupille war bedeutend enger als die der gesunden Seite^ aber auf liohteinfall beweglkh. Atropin rief un- ToUständige Erweiterung, Calabar hingegen maximale Myosis her*- vor, ausserdem war der^twas weniger resistente Bulbus unbedeutend zaräcicgesunken. Homer bezog, und wohl mit Recht, diese Affeetion auf eine Lähmung der Fasern des Halsstranges des Sympaihicus. Dadurch wird sowohl die Ptosis, duroti Lähmung des vom Syrapathicus versorgten sog. Müller 'sehen M. palpebrae super., als auch die Myosis, durch Lähmung des Dilatator — wegen nmngelnden Unterschiedes in der Färbung resp. den Gefässver« hältnissen der beiden Regenbogenhäute konnte dieselbe nicht ledig- lieh durch Gefässfüllung bedingt sein — , sowie endlich auch die erhöhte Temperatur und Rothe der betreffenden Seite vollkommen erklärt. Homer sah in diesem Falle ein Qegenstüek zu der bei Morbus Basedowii vorkommenden Augenaffection ; hier fehlt indess in der Regel die Pupillenerweiterung, deren regelmässiges resp. häufiges Yorkommen allerdings von manchen Autoren, wie Romberg, Henoch, Reith, Geigel, Friedreich, Trous- seau, Raehlmann, Emmert u. A. angeführt wird; Letzterer sah (Arch. f. Ophth. XVII, 1, p. 219) die Pupille auch oft enger als normal, v. Graefe (Eulen bürg u. Guttmann, Grie- singer's Aroh. f. Psychiatr. u. Nervenkr. I, p. 420—454) konnte nach Untersuchung von ca. 200 Fällen von Morbus Basedowii die Mydriasis nicht bestätigen, hielt sie vielmehr, wo sie vorhanden war, von Complicationen, wie von Myopie und dergl. abhängig. Nach Eulenburg (Berl. klin. Wochenschr. 1869, p. 287) sind ,,bei echtem Morbus Basedowii, selbst bei dem bedeutendsten Exophthalmus, keine Spur von Mydriasis, überhaupt keine Pupillar- erscheinungen vorhanden.^ An die erwähnte Homer ^sche Beobachtung schliessen sich die Fälle von sog. essMitieller Phthisis bulbi oder Opthalmomalacie an« 7* - 100 — BooaaCTsaiisad;, Amer. opbtii. Soe., p. ^—91; Nagd^s Jhubes- bericht f. 1870, p. 270) beobitehtete einen ähnlidira Fall yoh in Anfällen auftretender Injeetion eines Auges mit heftigem Sdimerz, Trägheit der Pupille, Thränen and etwas SponnuagsTfMrmindenui^ des Bulbus und nahm eine vasomotorische Neurose an. Die para- lytische Myosis war hier, wie in^ dem Fall von Landesberg (Arch. f. Ophth. XYU, 1, p. 309) mit ,,8ehr enger'' PupiUe, offenbar durch GiUarreiasnngcompiioirty zumal da v. Q-raefe (Arch. f. Ophä. XU,% p. 261), Nagel (ibid. XIII, 2, 409) und Schmidt (Qraefe IL Saemisch, Handb. etc. Y, p. 155) die'BeaclJoB der Pupille ab YoUkommen gut bezeichnen. Die Pupille war — einen Fall von Schmidt (1. c. p. 154) ausgenommen, wo dieselbe normal, „viel- leicht sogar eine Spur grösser'' war — gewöhnlich nur ein wcBig ei^ger, als die des anderen Auges. Man wird gewiss nicht fehl gei^n, wenn man diese bei Ophthalmomalacie vorkommende Myosis ebenfalls für eine paralytische hält. Schmidt (1. e.) ist auch ge- neigt, die Ophthalmomalacie, wenigstens die einfache, überhaupt auf eine Sympathicusaffection zu beziehen, namentlich, weil er such in einem Falle gleichzeitig Ptosis beobachtete. Auch bei der von Nagel (Klin. Monatabi. XIII, p. 394 ff.) beschriebenen und nach ihm unzweifelhaft auf eine paralytische Affeetibii des Hals- sympathicus zurückzuführenden, vorzugsweise bei Keratitis auf- tretenden, Hypotonie findet sich constant PupiUenvereogerusg 0* c. p. 397). Endlich ist noch die bei Trigeminuslähmungen auftretende Myosis (^Hirsch berg Berl. klin. Wochenschr. 1868, Nr. 10,11) aus der gleichzeitigen Lähmung der pupillenerweiteruden vom Sympathicus in den Trigeminus übergehenden Fasern ohne Schwierig- keit zu erklären, da das Yerhalten der Pupille hier ganz dem nach Trigeminusdurchschneidung an Tbicren entspricht. Während sowohl die bisher betrachteten Formen der Myosis, die paralytische wie die spasmotische, überall da, wo keine Coid- plicationen vorliegen, einen mittleren Orad von Pupillenenge be- dingen, treffen bei der durch nervöse Einflüsse bewirkten maxi- malen Myosis, wo der Pupillendurchmesser nach Wecker (Qraefe und Saemisch lY, p. 563) bis auf V^ mn^- herabsinken kann, beide Mo- mente zusammen, wie wir dies bei Einwirkung verschiedener Myo- tica, namenthch des Eserins und ^Nicotins, auf die Pupille bereits — 101 - koBtoeB gelernt haben. Von einem Aufeählen der einzelnen Krank- heitsprocesee, bm denen maximale Myosis vorkommt, können wir hier absebent da es wobl kaum einen gibt, bei dem dieselbe regel* mSsßUg auftritt. Sehr selten wird man sie dort finden, wo nr^ sprüngHefa eine »pasmotisohe Myosis bestand, da eben dann noch eise Lähmang in einem von dem bereits befallenen mehr weniger entfernten Gebiete hinzutreten musste, während viel eher einmal t»ne RelKang der pupilien verengernden Fasern eine bestehende Lähmung der pupiilenerweiternden compliciren kann. So nimmt eine paralytisehe Myosis bereits auf physiologische Reize hin bei sehr intensiver Beleochtang sowie bei energischen Accommodations- jresp. Coavet genzbe wegungen vorübergehend den Charakter einer ma&imalen an. Da wir aber unter Myosis einen dauernden Zu* stand verstehen, so kann eine eigentliche maximale Myosis, die sich oamenäieh noch dnreh vollständige Unbeweglichkeit der Pu- pille auszeichnet, nur durch Hinzutreten einer dauernden Reiz- ung des SphiBCter pupillae, wie sie sich bei Accommodationsspas- mus, bei Ofliameuralgie, Meningitis etc. indet, zu einer Lähmui^ des Dilatator, oder umgekehrt, zu Stande kommen. Durch secun- däre Contractur des Sphincter pupillae, wie sie sich zu paralytischer, sritener zu spasmodscher Myosis hinzugesellt, kann schliesslich aiioli noch maximale Myosis hervorgerufen werden. Nie wird in- dess eine rein paralytische oder eine rein spasmotische Myosis die Charaktere der maximalen zeigen können. In der Literatur finden sich noch einige Fälle von Myosis bd Himerkrankungen verzeichnet, welche man nicht mit Bestimmt- heit in die eine oder die andere Kategorie einreihen kann, von denen daher hier kurz einige erwähnt werden mögen. Bei der Apoplexie in den Pens Yaroli wird von allen Beob- achtern eine enge Pupille angeführt; während Larcher (Patho- logie de la protaberance annulaire, deuxiöme tirage, p. 54 ff.) eine gleichz^tige Unbeweglichkeit derselben behauptet, woraus man also auf eine Reizungsmyosis sohliessen müsste, constatirte Jüdell (Berl klin. Wochenschrift 1872, Nr. 24) in semem Falle jederzeit eine gute Reaction beider Pupillen, ohne irgend eine Yerziehung nach mner Seite, was die Zurflckführung der Pupillenverengerung auf eine durch das filutextravasat bedingte Reizungsmyosis etwas zweifdhaft macht, vielmehr für eine durch Druck auf das pupilien« — 102 — erweiternde Gentrum zu erkläreade paralytische Miosis «pridit. Ferner fand Bosenbach (Arcb. f. Opfath. XYIII, 1, p. 81—51) in einem Falle von Hirntumor betderdeits enge Pupillen mit trägerer Reaction linkerseits; zugleich bestand neben einem geringen €hnad Ton Ptosis hochgradige Amblyopie. Bei der Section fand sieh der hintere Theil des Thalamus opticus dureh einen Tumor nach hinten gedrängt, durch welchen somit ,,sichtlieh ein Druck auf die Vier^ hflgel ausgeübt wurde^. Pcltzer (Berl. klin. Wochenechr. 1872, Nr. 47) beobachtete dagegen' einen Fall von plötzlich unter den Symptomen der Apoplexie aufgetretener doppelseitiger ErUindong ohne jeden ophthalmoskopischen Befund mit massiger Myoms und YoUständig aufgehobener Pupillarreaction. Bei der * Section &nd sich ausser einem Embolie der Art. basiiaris je ein ziemlich sym- metrisch gelegener gelber Erweichungsherd im hinteren äusseren Drittel der Thalami optici sowie beginnende Erwercbnng in den Vierhügeln. Während wir die Myosis in diesem Falle vielleicht als eine spasmotische. durch den Erweichungsprocess in den Yierhügeln be- dingte auffassen können, so spricht der geringe Orad von Ptosis bei beiderseits engen Pupillen ohne Aufgehobensein der Reaction auf Licht in dem Rosenbach 'sehen Falle gegen eine Reisungs- und eher für eine Läfamungsmyosis. Merkwürdig wäre dann eben nur, dass bei ungefähr gleichem Sitz der Affection — im hinteren Theile des Thalamus opticus und den Yierhügeln — das eine Mal eine Reizung des pupiilenverengernden und das andere Mal eine Lähmung des pupillen erweiternden Centrums zu Stande gekommen ist. Andrerseits würde dieser Umstand auf eine Verbindung zwischen den beiden Centren resp. auf ein nahes Nebeneinanderliegen der* selben hindeuten (cf. S. 55). Hochgradige Myosis ist auch, abgesehen von den sie beglei* tenden Processen, an sich im Stande, eine erhebliche Sehstörung zu verursachen, indem durch die enge Pupille einerseits das Ge- sichtsfeld eingeengt und andrerseits die auf der Netzhaut ent- worfenen Bilder zu lichtschwach werden. So klagte in dem Wil le- hr an dachen Falle der Patient über Abnahme des Sehvensifigens, obwohl er eine vollkommen intakte Sehschärfe besass und die feinsten ihm vor das Auge gehaltenen Oegenstände unterscheiden konnte. Orössere Objecte, z. B. vor ihm stehende Personen, suh — 108 — er nur tbeilwaise, aber in den gesehenen Theilen deutlieh. Sok^be Patienten mit maximaler Myosis verhalten sich ähnlieh wie Krankt^y welche an Retinitis pigmento&i mit concentriseher Geaichtsfeldbe* sdiränkung leiden. Wir kommrai jetad; m dw zweiten grossen Grappe von patho logiseben Zuständen, zu den mit Mydriasis einhergehenden. Bei der Mydriasis unterscheiden wir ebenso wie bei der Myosis eine mittlere und eine maximale , von denen die erstere, wie sich aus unseren früheren Betrachtungen ergibt, sowohl durch Beizung der pupillenerweiternden als durch Lähmung der pupillenverengernden Fasern bedingt sein, die letztere aber nur durch Zusammentreffen beider Umstände zu Stande kommen kann. Diese verschiedenen Formen der Mydriasis verhalten sich ganz analog denen der Myoüs, nur in entgegengesetzter Weise. Die Beizungs- oder spas- motisehe Mydriasis, welche auf Erregung der pupillener- weitemden Fasern beruht, charakterisirt sich durch eine massig er- weiterte, auf Lichteinfall und Convergenabewegungen mehr weniger prompt, auf sensible, psychische und das pupillenerweitemde Gmi- tnirn t4<ei&nde Mitbewegungsreize hingegen gar nicht reagirende Pupille, welche leicht durch Mydriatica zur maximalen Erweiterung, durch Myotica indess schon etwas schwerer zur maximalen Yer- engerung gebracht werden kann. Bei der Lähmung s- oder paralytischen Mydriasis hingegen, welche m einer Lähmung der pupillenverengeruden Faseru ihren Grund hat, haben wir ausser einer ebenfalls massig erweiterten Pupille - wofern keine mecha- aiseben Hindemisse vorliegen — noch ein Vorhandensein der ReactÜMien auf sensible, psychische und alle diejenigen Beize zu verzeichnen, welohe die Integrität des pupillenerweiternden Cen- trums voraussetzen. Die Beaction auf Licht und Convergenzbe« wegungen kann sich indess verschieden gestalten, je nach dem Sitz der die Mydriasis bedingenden Affecti(m. Ist die Leitung zwischen Iris und pupillenverMigemdem Centrum unterbrochen, so fehlt so- wohl die direkte, als die consensuelle Beaction auf Lichtreiz, eben- so wie die Mitbewegung der Pupille auf Acconunodationsimpulse; ist hingegen eine Lähmung der die Betina mit äeja pupillenv«^ engernden Centrum verbindenden Fasern vorhanden, so wird die direkte PupiHarcontraetion auf Lichteinfall aufgehoben, die consen- eoelle Beaolion, sowie die auf Convergenzbewegungen indess er* - 104 — halten sein. In dem einea wie im dem andern Faile kami man durch Mydriatica die Pu^Ie leicht ad maximum erweitern, durch Myotioa aber nicht mehr ah bis zur mittleren Weit^ Ter^igeni. Bei maximaler Mydriasis, also bei gleichzeitiger Erregung der pupillenerwdternden und Lähmung der puptllenverengemden Fasern, findet 8i<di neben äussereter Erweiterung der Pupille absolute Beactionslosigkeit derselben auf Reize aller Art ; nur kräftige My o- tica yermögen hier die übermässige Weite der PupiHe zur normalen zurückzuführen. Bpasmotische Mydriasis tritt bei allen denjenigen krankhaften Zuständen auf, welche direkt oder indirekt einen Beiz entweder auf das pupiUenerweitemde Centrum oder auf die pupSlenerweiteni* den Fasern selbst an irgend einer Stelle ihres langen Yerianfefi von der MeduUa oblongata bis zum Diktator pupillae resp. den Blutgefässen der Iris ausüben. Es ergibt sich hieraus ohne Weiteres, dass die mit Reizungsmydriasis verbundenen Afieetionen fast alle ausserhalb des Auges ihren Sitz haben werden; gleichwohl wird auch das Auge in Folge der durch die Mydriasis selbst entsteheo- den funktionellen Störung mehr wenige in Mitleidenadiaft ge- zogen. Zunächst werden wir bei allgemeinen Reizzuständen des Ruckenmarks, namentlich seiner oberen Partien, des Halsmariu und der Medulla oblongata, — durch was auch immer sie bedingt sein mögen Reizangsmydriasis finden, also bei Hyperämie des Rückenmarks und seine Hüllen, bei Meningitis spinalis. im Retzungs- stadium der Myelitis ; auch können im Halatiieile des Rüdcenmarks sich bildende Tumoren zu Anfang Pupillenerweiterung hervoriiifeB. Ob die in allen Fällen Ton mit Stauungspapille verbundenen Hirn* tumoren von Raehlmann (I. c. p. 11) regelmässig beobachtete Mydrians, sowie die bei starkem Himdruck, nach Blutergüssen in die Schädelfaöhle und bei chronischem Hydrocephalus sich fast aus- nahmslos vorfindende Pupillenerweitenmg immer zu einer Retzung des pupillenerweitemden Centrums in Beziehung zu brii^n ist, musB zweifelhaft erscheinen, da eine Lähmung der puptUenver' engemden Fasern resp. • des Oculomotorius hier eben so gut die Ursache sein kann« Femer ist die spasmotisohe Mydriasis ein Symptom der söge- nannten Spinaltrritation, welche wir häufig bei nervösen, chlorotisohen - 106 - waA soAmmsk^ny chur^ Säftenferioste und aoliwere Krankheiten, wt6 Typhus (Seiffert, L c), geschwächten Persraen, ebenso bei hyste^ cischen und hypochondrisohen IndWidaen an^ffen. Ausserdem ist eine erweiterte, aber auf Lipht reagirende Pupille oft der Yorbote tabetis<^F Ersdheinungen, wie wohl überhaupt allen Kückenmark»- uad Hirnerkra^ungen, welebe von sf^nannter sfttnaler Myosis begleitet zu werden pflegen, ein Stadium der Reiamng voraufgeht, m dem man die Pupille Erweitert findet. Nicht minder bewirken alle diejenigen Zustande, welche m^ittelbar mxe Erregung des pupillenerweiternden Centrums her- b^ttbren, Beizui^smydriasis. So ist es eine bekannte Thatsacbe, dass die Helminthiasis mit wetten Pupillen einhergeht (cf. S e i f f e r t« L c. und Richarz, 1. c); die Ursache hierfür ist in ein^ Bdzung der sensiblen Darmnerven dureh die Eingeweidewürmer zu suchen. Ganz dieselbe Mydriasis sehen wir bei lebhaften Schmerzen in den Eingeweiden, in Folge deren sich nach Duchenne de Boulogne (Oaz. hebdora. 1864, p. 147) sogar die rayotischen Pupillen der Tabetiker erweitern können. Rossbach (Inaug. Diss. Jena 1869) theilt einen Fall mit, wo Druck auf Medtastinaltumoren Erweiterung der Pupille hervorrief, und nach Seiffert (I. c.) kommt Mydiiasis auch bei sog. Tabes meseraica vor. Auch nimmt man an, dass die Erweiterung der Pupille bei der , Bleikotik auf Beizung der sensiblen Eingeweidenerven beruhe, da man bei Nierenstein- und Gallensteinkoliken ebenfalls Pupülenerweiterung auftreten sieht. Das Blei scheint übrigens noch einen specifischen Einftuss auf die Sijmpathisdien Fasern auszuüben; Heymann (Berl. klin. Wochen- wixt. 1860, lÜTr. 19) sah bei Aphasia saturnina auf beiden Seiten gleiehraiesig erweiterte. Ha ase (Zehend. klin. Mtsbl. V, p. 225 — 228) bei Amaurosis saturnina etwas dilatirte, träge reagirende PupiUen bei Spuren quantitativer Licfatempfindung, während in dem von Bau (Arch. f. Ophth. I, 2, p. 205>-208) beschriebenen Falle von ,)Amaurose durch Färben der Kopfhaare mit einem bleihaltigen Mittel^ maximale Mydriams bestand, was offenbar auf eine Affection der pupillenerweitomden Fasern hindeutet. Schmidt (Arch. f. Ophth. XIV, l, p. 29) beobachtete unter den Fällen von „Aocom- modationsbeschränkung bei Zahnleiden^ einige, welche mit geringer, und zwei, welche mit ungewöhnlicher Pupillenweite und etwas trägerer Beweglichkeit einhergingen; doch war diese Erscheinung -- 106 - ^keinenfalk so bedenteBd , um Ideniiis auf LSirnntiig des den Sphincter pupilfaie yersorgenden OcnloiaotoriuBaates zu Beblkssen^. Wahnoheinlich berahte diese Mydriasift auf Tefleotcnriaeher Reiz- wag des pupHtenerweiternden Genlrums durch den Trigerainus, zu- mal da Schmidt die Aceommodationsparese ^dureh intraoovlare Drucksteigeraug, welefae ausgeht von einer reflat^eriseh aogeregteü Rdzimg der vasomotorisdieii NerTen des Auges^ erkl&rt. Wie auch Wecker (1. c. p. 562) bemerkt, fiudet man diese in Folge von Spinalreizung auftretende Mydriasis allerduigs weit seltener yon Ac- eomm<idation8lähmttng begleitet, als die durch Lähmung der pupillen- verengernden Fasern entstandene; die Bemerkung Raehlmann's (1. G. p. 12); dass die auf Sympathiousreizung beruhende Pupilles- erweiterung zum Unterschiede von der bei Oculomotoriusparese vorkommenden neben vollständig intakter Aceommodation bestehe, trifft daher nicht zu. Femer wird^ spasmotisehe Mydriasis häufig durch psychiBcbe Aufregungszustände hervorgerufen. So ist die Mydriasis nadi Seif f er t (1. c.) ein nahezu constantes Symptom der acuten Manie, ebenso findet man sie bei der Melancholie, Bamentlioh aber bei dfr progressiven Paralyse der Irren, wo sie oft einseitig, neben Myoais auf dem anderen Auge, erscheint. Nach Arndt (Oriesinger's Archiv för Psychiatrie etc. II, p. 589 591) ist einseitige Mydriasfs mit Trägheit der Pupillarreactionen ein Ausdruck beginnender Lähmung im Gehirn. Nam^^tlich berechtigt aber einseitige mit Beweglichkeit verbundene Pupillenerweiterung, wenn die Pupillen abwechselnd und in kurzen Zwischenräumen mydriatiscfa und wie- der myotisch werden^ zur Prognose einer bald eintretenden Oeistss- Störung, v. Graefe (Fall von ephemerer und stets aufs Neue aaütauchender Mydriasis. Arch. f. Ophth. III, 2, p. d59-.3d3) be- schreibt einen derartigen Fall von sogenannter „springender^ My- driasis, wo ein sehr häufiges, oft iunerhalb einiger Stunden statt* findendes Altemir^i zwisdien äusserster Mydriasis mit vollkommener Unbeweglichkeit der Pupille und massiger Erweiterung mit geru^r Pupillarreaction - es bestand daneben Amaurose resp. Amblyopie — zu beobachten war, und knüpft daran die Bemerkung, dass er in solchen Fällen meist einige Monate, in einem Falle erst ^4 Jahr nachher, Geistesstörung, und zwar unter d^ Form des Grössen- — 107 — irahüs habe auftreten sehen« Wie Wecker (L c. f>. 56d) angikt^ tritt auch nadi gesdbleohtiieheit Erregni^^i Mydmsis auf. Krankhafte Prooesse^ wekhe das pn;piUeBerweiiernde Ce»- tmm nicht reflectorisch., sondeni anf dem Wege der Mitbewegmif erregen, gibt es ebenfalls eine ganee Anzahl; Bermts früher haben urir gesehen, dass bei Atbembehinderang sich die PuptUen erweitern; Key her (Petersburger med« Zeitschr. 1B68, p. 298) sah plötsHoh starke Dyspnoe und mit ihr Pupälenerweiterung nach Verschlucken eines grossen Fleiscfastftckes eintreten. Auch wurde der Pilpillen^ erweilarung während der Respiration beim Oheyne-StO[kes'schen Athemphänom^i bereits mehrfach gedaclit. Beim eklamptischen Anfall haben wir sodann in der Regel mit dem Beginn desselben PupiUenerweitening mit triger Reaettvni ; nach Litzmann (Deut- sche Klinik 1852, Nr. 30) waren die Pupillen während des An* falls bald contrahirt, bald massig erweitert. Wo man indess maxi- mal erweiterte Pupillen beim eklamptische»! AnftiU findet, besteht m der Regel, wie in den Fällen Ton Lumpe (Wiener med. Woehenscfar. 1854, Nr. 29 und 31) gleichzdtig Amaurose. Auch leitet sich nach Nothnagel (Sammig. klin. Vorträge Nr. 39* p. 6) der epileptische Anfall „in vielen Fällen, sioht in allen, da- mit ein, dass das Oesicht des Patienten blass, seine Pupillen dilatirt werden. Man ist gezwungen, diese Pupilienerweiterung , dieses Erblassen auf eine krampfhafte Verengerung resp. Verschliessung^ der Gesichtsarterien, auf eine Reizung des Halssympathicus zurück* zafihren.^ Wir haben es beim eklamplaschen wie beim epilep- tischen Anfall mit einer Mtterregung des pupillenerw^ternden Geaor trums zu^rleich mit dem in der Medulla oblongata Hegenden Krampfcentrnm zu thun. Ebenso tritt, wie bereits früher erwähnt^ beim Eeuchhustenanfall, ferner bei Brech- und Würgbewegungen Dilatation der Pupille ein. Nach Müller (Deutsche Klinik 1870, Nr. 38) ist auch in manch^i, aber nicht in allen Fällen von Tri* dunose die Pupille etwas erweitert und von träger Reaotion. Auch diese Mydriasis ist ein Reizsymptom, welches, wenn es im Anfang der Erkrankung auftritt, wohl mit den heftigen Ersch^nungen von Seiten des Magens und Darmes in Verbindung zu bringen ist, während in den späteren Stadien die Ursache dafür in der er* schwerten Respiration und Herzschwäche zu suchen sein mag. Als eine Folge der Anämie des Gehirns (der Medutla oblongata P) — 108 — fiut»t Gerhardt (Ldirb. der Aaseultati^n wid PercQwon. 9. Aufl; p. 298) die ErweiteriHig der Pttpffle auf, wel^e naeh ihm häufig bei MitraUtenote gegw Ende der laspiratioB anftriM und im Laafe der Exspiration ei&er WiedenrereDgertt&g weii^it. ^8ie etltstehl dadoroh, dass die Respirath>n den ohnehin scbwaoben Aortenstrom »oeh mehr absehwäeht, eo daas am Sehlnese der Inspiration die üimanämie bis 2um Gb'ade der Pupillenerweiteraiig ansteigt.^ Ed handelt sich auch hier wohl um dne Beiznngsmydriaais. Baehl- mann (I. c. p. 10) ist endlich noch der Ansicht, dass auch die Mydriasis, welche steh reg^nässig bei Pbtfaisikern findet, auf Be* hinderung der Athmung zuruekzufähren sei; indess ist hier wohl die Anämie und Kachexie vorzugsweise ansusehuidigen, da die Dyspnoe gewöhnlieh doeh erst im lotsten Stadium der Krankheit in Betracht kommt. In gleicherweise wie durch meohanisehe Beizung des Hals- und des verKuigerten Markes wird die spasmotische Mydriasis durch Prooesse hervorgerufen , welche > die pupilknerweitemden Fasern auf ihrem Wege durch den. Haissympathicue, den Trigeminus VL, 8. w. bis zum Auge hin treffen. Alle Erkrankungen^ wollte durch Gompression die Sympathieusfasern gewöhnlich lähm^i, wie Geschwülste und Aneurysmen, bringen hier ebenso wie die Bücken- markstumoren und *-entzttndungen eine Mydriasis zu Stande, imdk Beizung der pupillen erweiternden Fasern. Ogle (1. c.) fand dieselbe Mydriasis wie bei elektrischer Beizung des Sympatitiens bei Oarcinom der Cervicaldrüsen, bei Aortenaneurysmen und auch bei einer entzündlichen Infiltration der Drüsen nach Scarlatina.

Das haͤtte ich mir in Wahrheit von dem Herrn v. U nicht eingebildet! Tantaene animis cœleſtibus irae? Wer hätte ſich das träumen laſſen, daß ein Mann, der ſolche Proben von einer gruͤnd⸗ lichen Einficht ın die freyen Künfte abgeleger hat, alg Mein Herr Gegner , gleichwohl eine fo fonnenflare Folgerung aus dem Grundfaße von der Wahrfcheins lichkeit, leugnen follee ?

Die gefunde Wernunft hat folches die griechie ſchen Tragödienfchreiber gelehret, che Diefer Welt⸗ weıfe Die Regeln der Dichtkunſt abfaflete, Es kommt mir eben fo vor, wenn man von Diefen Regeln fo gern abweichen will; als wenn ein elender Zimmermann, der nichts von der ariechifcehen oder roͤmſchen Baus Funft weis, den Vitruvius vor einen Grillenfängee gebundene Reden ꝛc. 617 ausgeben wollte, der ſich nach ſeiner Phantaſie e ſolche ſtrenge Regeln von den Saͤulenordnungen ausge⸗ dacht. Gerade, als ob nicht die groͤſten Baumeiſter vor feiner Zeit Die fchönften Gebäude darnach aufge⸗ führer haͤtten. Oder, als wenn ein Maler, dem man von dem Buche des Lairefle was vorfagte, und feine Fehler Daraus beurtheilete ; dieſen Scribenten vor -einen wunderlichen Grübler anfähe, deflen Regeln feinem als Geſetze aufgebürder werden koͤnnten: Da doc) deffen Buch nichts ın fich hält , als was lange zus vor von den gröften Künfti:en beobachtet worden.

Es Fonnte, auch bey ihnen faft nicht anders feyn , da die Perſo- nen, die den Chor ausmadıten nicht von der Stelle famen, big das ganze Stuͤcke aus war, und folge ih auch an einem Hrte ftehen blieben. Hieraus mußte alfo die Einigkeit des Ortes und der Zeit noth⸗ mendig folgen. Spricht man, ja das geht in allen Fabeln nicht an, zumal die zum theil aus der Hiſto⸗ vie genommen find: So fage ich: Deswegen hat ja ein Poet die Freyheitzu dichten , und alles foins Ges ſchicke zu bringen, daß es angeht, Und ob in der neuern Comödie der Griechen und Römerder Chor ke Zur un wordens So iſt doch die Einigkeit der Zeit und des Ortes geblieben; wie ausdem Tu a 5 rxenz 618 II.

Man hatdurd) die Abfchaffung des Chores [hen genug gewonnen, mern man an die ‚drey Stunden einer ſolchen Borftellung fo genau nicht gebunden iſt, und zur Noth auch wohl eines hal⸗ ben, ja ganzen Tages Geſchichte in ein Stüce brin- gen darf. Ariſtoteles iſt alſo fchon faft zu gelinde ge» wefen, indem er diefes zugeftanden hat: Weit ges fehle, daß er gar zu firenge Regeln —— N haben ſollte. Was die Neuigkeit der Opern anlanget, ſo meynte mein Herr Gegner, es ſey ein herrlicher Ruhm vor unſre Zeiten, daß man dergleichen erfunden habe, Es ift wahr, mas neües erfinden , iſt kein Schimpf, wenn esnur was Fluges ift; und eine Probe von dem guten Verſtande und Wihe ſeines Erfinders abgiebt. Wenn aber die neuen Erfindungen ungereimt wer— den: Sothäte man ja befler, wenn man bey dem Als ton bliebe. Ich komme wieder auf die Baufunfl. Wenn fih jemand unterffünde eine Art von Säulen zu erfinden, die oben dicfer als unten wären ; fo wäre diefes wohl mas neues: Allein, wer würde nicht. einen folchen Baumeifter auslachen , indem er nicht. bedächte, daß die erften Säulen rohe Stämme von Bäumen geweſen, die allemal unsen dicker als oben find. Man fan freylih an einem abgehauenen Baume auch das unterfte zu oberſt kehren. Allein bey den Alten iſt niemand ſo ungereimt geweſen, es zu verſuchen, und man hat die Ehre einer ſolchen Erfin⸗ dung etwa einem Neuern uͤberlaſſen. Doch mein Gegner haͤlt davor, die Opern waͤren auch alt.

Wegen des folgenden will ich mit dem Herrn v. U. nicht zanken. Man muß billig ſeyn, und aud) was nachgeben, Ich geftehe es ihm alſo zu, daß die ſchlechtformirten Charactere der Dpern- Helden der Oper nicht wefentlic) find.

Miteinem Worte, wir", wollen die fchlechten Charactere der elenden Dpern und Comoͤdien gegen einander aufheben: Iliacos intra muros peccatur & extra, . Eben das will ich von den Zoten und Fragen geſagt haben, die von unflätigen Comödianten ebenfalls nicht genugfam vermieden werden. Cs ift aud) das üppige Wefen in andern poetifchen Schriften häufig genug su finden, und alfo will ich den Opern daraus eben feinen befondern Schimpf machen. Nur das wird mir mein Herr Gegrter nad) feiner befannten Dilligfeit auch zugeben, daß geile Verſe durch das Singen, und durch reizende Geberden, noch drey⸗ mal kräftiger werden die Ueppigkeit zu-befördern.

Doch ſelbſt auf der Bühne würden gewiſſe olche Dinge erlaubt werden; wie ich ſchon in meiner Dichtkunſt angemerket. Z.E. Wenn ein Schauſpiel von der Andromeda gemacht wuͤrde, und man koͤnnte den Perſeus auf einem flie⸗ genden Pegaſus zu ihr kommen laſſen: So wuͤrde dieſes kein theatraliſcher Fehler ſeyn, wenn es nur gut ausgefuͤhtet werden koͤnnte. Ich würde mehr hin⸗ zu ſetzen, wenn ich nicht beſorgte, man würde den⸗ ken, haͤtte mich gar zu aͤngſtlich zu vertheidigen geſu t. Den folgenden Abſatz gebe ich dem Herrn Vers faſſer ganz zu. Er ſieht viele Misbraͤuche der Opern⸗ bühne ein; und ich müßte ſehr unbillig ſeyn, wenn ich es nicht geſtehen wollte. Nur bey der Frage, was der Verſtand des Zuſchauers bey der Vereinigung ſo vieler Kunſtwerke in einer Oper zu denken hat, bin ih mit ſeiner Antwort nicht zufrieden, Er ſagt: Eben das, was man bey einer ſchoͤnen Statue, oder bey andern Meiſterſtuͤcken der Kunſt denket. Ganz Hut: Über das geſchieht bier zur Unzeit. Die thea⸗ traliſche Fabel wird in einer ganz andern Abſicht ges fpiele, als daß Ic) den Maſchinenmeiſter bervundern foll. Sie muß durch ihre elgene Anmuth einneh⸗ men, bezaubern und rühren, nicht aber durch ſo viel fremde Zierathe die Sirine ihrer Zuſchauer zerſtreu⸗ en. Eine gute Tragödie hat alle diefe aͤuſſerliche Schmmke nicht noͤthig. Ein natuͤrlich ſchoͤn Frauen. zimmer iſt in ihrer ordentlichen Kleidung angeneh⸗ mer, als ein heßlich Geſichte mitten unter m | en " gebundene Reben ıc. 633 | chen Schattirflecken, Perlen und Edelgefteinen. Je - mehr mananihren Putz denfet, defto mehr wird man ben Mangel ihrer Schönheit inne. Wären die Oper⸗ fabeln an fich rührender geweſen, ſo hätte man fo viel fremden Beyſtand nicht nöthig gehabt, ſie angenehm zu machen. Und doc) gelingt es ihnen fo fchlecht, daß oft ihre Zufchauer mitten im Spiele davon lau⸗ fen, oder doch die Zeit mit Schwagen zubringen ? Welches gewiß in einer Tragödie oder Comoͤdie, die nur halbigt gut ift, geſchieht. Was der Herr v. U. im folgenden von der Morale der Opern rühmet, das muß ich feiner groffen Liebe zu derſelben zuſchreiben. Vielleicht würde er ſelbſt ſolche moraliſche Opern machen, als man bisher noch nicht gemacht hat. Der Pater Poree hat die Sit⸗ tenlehre der Opern ſo ſchoͤn entworfen, daß ich kein Wort davon ſagen darf. Man ſehe den Auszug von ſeiner Rede in dieſen Beytraͤgen nach. Was das Regiſter aller nichtswuͤrdigen Opern anlanget, welches der Herr Gegner fordert: So kan ich ihm ſelbiges ſo wenig als von den naͤrriſchen Comoͤdien verſprechen. Was iſt es aber noͤthig alle ſchlimme zu wiſſen, da wir beyde eins ſind, daß es ſehr viele, ja unzaͤhliche giebt? Nur darinn find wir uneins, ob es auch gute giebt? Und gleichwohl for⸗ dere ich von den Liebhabern nicht ein Regiſter von al⸗ len; ſondern nur etliche wenige nahmhaft zu machen. Bin ich nicht weit billiger als meine Gegner? Die blinde Liebe, die man einigen gegen die Tragoͤdien und Comoͤdien ſchuld giebt, nehme ich Mir gar nicht an: Indem ich mir ſchmeichele, daß ich Proben genug ab⸗ geleget habe, daß ich die Schaubuͤhne nicht blind⸗ | Nr 5 linge 634 U. Herrn Joh. St. von Uffenbach lings beurtheifet habe. Wenn nur alle Opernfreum⸗ - be bey fich fo wohl zu Haufe wären. Die Parthey⸗ lichfeit, fo man. dem Herren St. Evremond, Ras cine und dem Spectator ſchuld giebt, hat einigen Schein; weil fie felbft vor die comifche und tragifche Schaubühne Stüdfe verfertiget harten. Wo biei« ben aber Boileau, la Bruyere, und Des Callies res? haben die auch Tragödien gemacht ? Was habe ich nicht neulich dem Herrn D. H. noch vor an dere Zeugen hinzu gefeßt ? Was fönnte ich nicht. noch vor neue anführen ? Wenn id) dem Riviere du Fre- my bey der Hand hätte, fo follte ihm eine Hübfche Stel» le zu Dienften ftehen. Jetzt habe ich nur den Ba- ron von Poͤllnitz, der gewiß mit feinen Memoires ung Deutfchen feine Schande macht. Sein Zeug. niß wird mir auch um defto mehr zu flatten kommen, da er die beften Schaufpiele von Europa überall felbft geſehen, und miteinander zu vergleichen Geſchmack genug gehabt hat. Quoique je ſois paflionne pour la Mulfique Italienne, ſchreibt er T.

La Bruyere verdient feinen Glau« ben: Warum das? Denn WMerville hat des Mies nage Lobrede auf denfelben mwiederlegt. Iſt das nicht eine herrliche Folgerung? Weiter: Bruyere Fan unmöglich recht haben, wenn er die Opern vera achtet: Warum nicht? Denn fonft hätte Ludewig XIV umfonft ganze Millionen verwandt. Abermal ein herrlicher Schluß.

Denn was für einen Stolz mürde man ihm nicht beygelegt haben, wenn er ges ſagt hätte: Ein guter Poet fey dem Staate eben fo nöthig, als ein Premierminifter?

Januar ver gangen, seit König Wilhelm draußen im viranzosenlar.de, in der alten König«statt de« «rbsmube-, vom Donner der Kanonen umklungeu, Lnm deutschen Kaiser gekrönt wurde. Heute, » beeser Zeit trüber Wirren und wüsten Partei» gezänke-, thnt r< uns doppelt wohl, un« zurück zu versetzen in jene Iuaendtage de« neuen Reiche-, m jene Tage frischer Begeisterung und opferfreu diger Baterlaud«liebe, un- zu erinnern, wie der patriotische Vorschlag de« König- Ludwig zur Eruenerung der Kaiserwürde zündend einschlug in alle deutschen Herzen und wie da« Lebehoch, da« der Großherzog von Baden im Namen der deutschen Fürsten und Stämme aus den Kaiser «»«brachte, an« dem Spiegelsaale zu Versailles j«j»en Weg fand durch das ganze deutsche Heer und millionenfach witcrhallte im gesammten »rutschen Baterlande. Der Tag, an welchem die Krönung erfolgte, war der 170. Jahrestag der Unfrichtnng de« preußischen Königthum« zu Kö nigsberg (wo am 18. Januar 1701 der Kur fürst Friedrich III. von Brandenburg zum König gekrönt worden); man hielt diese beiden Ereignisse neben einander und gedachte dankbar der großen Wandlung, die mit Preußen, mit Deutschland vorgeganaen: Preußen schickte sich an, in Deutsch land auszuaehen, und diese« letztere hatte seine Einheit wieder gesunden. Kaiser Wilhelm aber ließ sich in seiner kommen Demuth, in seiner strengen Gewissen haftigkeit nicht durch den Glanz der neuen Krone otmden, mit deren Erwerbung er seine Aufgabe noch nicht für abgeschlossen hielt. In der Ver kündigung, die er am 18. Januar 1871 an da- deulsch« Volk erließ, sprach er eS vielmehr au«, daß nunmehr erst eine nene Reih« von Pflichten für ihn beginne, Pflichten, die er znsammensaßte m den Wunsch und da« Versprechen, „allzeit Mehrer de- deutschen Reiche- zu sein, nlcht au kriegerischen Eroberungen, sondern an den Gütern und Gaben de- Fr,eben- auf dem Gebiete nationaler Wohlfahrt, Freiheit »nd Gesittung. Der Kaiser hat un- sein Wort gehalten ; in gewohnter Weise Ernst mit Milde paarend, hat cp Mit rührender Treue festgehalten an dem Ber traue» zu seinem Volke, und selbst die tiesschmerz licken Erfahrungen, die er gerade in diesem letzten e machen mußte, haben sein Vertrauen nicht tert; ungebrochen ist sein väterlich-kindlicher m; weder Alter noch Krankheit haben sein Ge- mülh verbittert, seinen Pflichteifer verkümmert, seine Arbeitslust gelähmt. An un« ist es, Gleiche« mit Gleichem z» vergelten, Treue mit Treue, Aus- cpseruoa «it Anfopserung z« belohnen und mit dem Kaiser »» die Wette einzutreten al« „Mehrer de« Reiche« an den Gütern und Gaben de« Krie au-", vor Allem de- inneren Frieden-, weither die Grundbedingung der nationalen Wohlfahrt ist.

Angesicht- de- einmütbigen Urtheil- dürfte e- auch schwer sein, den Bewerb auurtreten, daß der Reichstag durch Ann«M Gesetz entwurf« in dieser Gestalt sein Maschen erhöhen würde. Indessen nicht allein die »Proviuzial-Eorre« pondenz", auch andere osficiöse Prrßstimmen lassen erkennen, daß die im Bunde-rathe tonan gebende Regierung mildere Saiten aufznziehen ge denkt. So wird jetzt „auf Grund guter Informa tion" einem vielfach zu osficivsen Kandgevungen benutzten norddeutschen Blatte geschrieben: Die Berathung de« Gesetzentwurf« wegen der Strafaewalt de« Reich-tag- über seine Mitglieder soll, wie man hört, tm Bun- deSrathe so beschleunigt werden, daß der Reichstag die Vorlage bei seinem Zusammentritt vmfindet. lieber die Nvthwendigkrit, den in der letzten Session hervorgetretenen Hebel« ständen abzubelfen, besteht im Bunde-rath« keine Meinungsverschiedenheit. dagegen wird sehr be dauert, daß der Reich-t ag selbst nicht damal-schon die Initiative ergriffen bat, um Abhülfe zu schaffen. Ueber die Frage, ob da« Unerläßliche auf dem Wege der Gesetzgebung oder durch Abände rung und Ergänzung der Seschä-ft-ord- nung gethan werden kann'» werden die Regie rungen vorau-stchtlich dem Reichstag, selbst die Entscheidung überlassen Nimmt er daS.

Für dio Bestimmung in 8 4, welche dem Reichstage daS Recht ercheilt» ein Mit glied wegen einer Ungebühr, welch« den Thal bestand einer nach den Bestimmungen de- ge meinen Strafrecht- strafbaren Handlung bildet, dem Strafrichter zu überweisen, sowie für die Be stimmung in 8- derzusolge die Lommisston die Entziehung drS passiven Wahlrecht- auS- sprechen kann, dürft« selbst im Bunde-rathe nur eine Minorität zu staden sein. Die problematischen Lorbeeren de- Herrn von Heeremann habe» baS Mitglied der Württem bergs scheu Kammer Herrn Schwarz nicht ruhen lassen.

Diese sei indeß oft so kurz, daß er keine Verpflichtung übernehmen könne, der Kammer Mittheilung zu machen. Wolle Schwär» den Einfluß der Kammer geltend machen, so müsse er einen anderen Weg al- den der Interpellation wählen. Schwarz be hält sich einen bezüglichen Antrag vor." Welche Strafgewalt dem englischen Parla mente zusteht, darüber dürfte eine Betrachtung letzt am Platze sein. Da« „B. T." schreibt mit Bezug darauf: Minister Mbingdon wurde wegen einer «edh welckie er gegen leinen Attornev (Staatsanwalt) im Oberhause hielt, zu 100 Pfund Sterling un» Laution für fernere gute Führung verurtheilt, da diese Mde gedruckt dem Publicum vorlag (Fische!, VerfaHmg England», Seite 4t7). Ebenso wurde Mr. Ereesy ISIS verurtheilt, da ein tsendmee» Blatt eine ferner ParlamentSreden auf seinen Wunsch wörtlich mittheilte, wegen welcher ihn ein Londoner Privatmann auf Beleidigung verklagte. Seine Appellation an daS königlich« Gericht wurde zurück gewiesen und da« Unterhaus bestätigte, daß in diesem Falle eine Verletzung der Privilegien de» Parlaments durch den UrtyeilSspruch nicht statt gefunden bade. Allerdings kann der Preßbericht über Paria- mentSverhandlungen, selbst der stenographi sche, festen zur Grundlage einer solchen Klage ge macht werden, wenigsten» nicht seiten- eine- Nicht- mitgliede- der Volksvertretung. Denn die Berichte der Zeitungen sind in England nur geduldet, aber nicht eigentlich gesetzlich gestattet. Um so be rechtigter aber ist dann die Klage gegen daS Preß- organ selbst, welches nach englischer Auslegung auf eigene Faust beleidigende und schädigende Aeuße- rungen verbreitet. Innerhalb des Parlaments kann nur ein Mitglied die Klage aufnehmen und den Belei diger vor daS Gericht des Präsidenten laden. DieS ist namentlich häufig wegen „mieäemeenor«", also wegen groben UnkugS geschehen; erst neuerdingS noch mußte Mr. Kenealy, der Anwalt des fal schen Tichborne. wegen solchen Vergehens in den „Parlamentsarrest". Denn in der That blitzt daS englische Unterhaus für ziel- und maß lose Redner ein besonderes Carcer. Dem Sprecher oder Präsidenten deS HauseS steht zum Zweck der Durchführung solchen Urtbeil- ein 8eege,i>l ,i »rm-i zur Seite. Gewaltthätige Aus schreitungen seitens politischer Rüpel im Parlament find also nicht aut möglich. Wie weit übrigen» die DlSciplinaraewalt de- Sprecher- geht, dafür bietet der Fall de» Jacobitrn Schippen ein Beispiel, welcher 1771 die ganz« Session über in den Tower gesperrt wurde, und zwar lediglich deshalb, weil er die Person deS KöniaS in die Debatte gezogen. Wilkes wurde 1703 wegen einer Schmähschrift verhaftet und fand keinen Schutz von Seilen d«S HauseS Diesem Vorbild einer durchaus praktischen, nn EonftitutionaliSmuS alt gewordenen Nation zufolge dürste der BiSmarck'sch« Entwurf, wenn er an sich auch unannehmbar ist, immerhin Veranlassung geben, daß der ReichStaa der Frage der DiSciplinarver- schärsung und öffentlichen Sicherheit gegenüber den etwaigen Ausschreitungen seiner Mitglieder näher trete. Aber aus ihre gesetztlichen Vorschriften haben die Herren von jenseit- de- Eanal» schlechterding- fich nicht so viel einzubilden, wie sie Lies iu den wuthschäumenden Deklamationen lbnn» mit denen st« Deutschland gegenüber fich jetzt so überaus frei gebig ^,g«n. Treffend bemerkt eine Berliner Corresponden; der natiooalliberalen „Elderfelder Zeitung" nach einer Zusammenstellung der verschiedene» gegen den Entwurf erhobenen Bedenken zum Schluß: „Alle diese bis letzt geltend gemachten Bedenken stellen eS als voraussichtlich hin, daß der Entwurf bedeutende Lenderunqen wird erfahren müssen, ehe er Gesetzeskraft erlangt, Aenderungen. welche vielleicht keine zu großen Schwierig keiten bereiten werden, sobald sich einmal zwischen deni Reichskanzler und der Mehrheit des Reichstage« daS Einvernehmen über den Grundgedanken klarstem, daß eS nothwendig ist, der socialistischen Agitation auch auf der parlamentarischen Tribüne einen Riegel vor,«schieben. ES scheint unS deshalb keineswegs die Hoffnung aufzugeben sein, daß diese» Resultat sich erreichen lassen wird, ohne die Satzungen der Reichs verfassung in Mitleidenschaft zu ziehen. Die Lrbsol-e in Lraunschweig. Die Spannung, welche die braunschweigische Erbfolgefrage nicht nur im Lande, sondern weit über dessen Grenzen hinau« hervoraerufen, findet jetzt täglich erneuten Ausdruck. E« mag heute eine Stimme der Wissenschaft über die Zukunft de- HerzogthumS vernommen werden Wilhelm Beseler hat sich in der Wochenschrift „Im neuen Reich" über die braunschweigische Erb folge ausgesprochen, und zwar mit gewohnter Klarheit und Entschiedenheit dahin, daß nach dem Tode des Herzog» Wilhelm nicht« Anderes übrig bleibe, als das Herzog thum mit Preußen zu vereinigen. Da- ist die Lösung, die wir selbst al» die nach Lage der Dinge allein mögliche »nd al- die einfachste em pfehlen. E-gab einen Augenblick, wo dynastische Gefühle am Berliner Hofe vielleicht den Sieg davontragen konnten über die kalte StaatSraison E» war der Augenblick, wo der arme König Georg V. starb und fein Sohn, der mal contente Herzog von Cumberland, sich entschließen mußte, ob er, wie sein Bater. seine Ansprüche aus den Thron von Hannover aufrecht erhalten wolle oder nicht. Hätte er damals seinen Frieden mit der Krone Preußen zu machen gesucht, so würde ihm Die- vielleicht ge lungen sein. :r20 nomme«, sonder« sich in letzter Zeit sogar noch verstärkt. Dank dem Ungeschick, mit dem Gras Euleavurg die Wahle» zum Reichstag geleitet. Unmöglich kann Preutzen so thöricht s«n, ihnen rn Vraunschweig, so zu sagen vor de» Thor« Hannover», einen Heerd »nd Mittelpunkt z» er richten. Daran würde selbst eine Verzichtleistung re» Herzog» von Cumberland wenig ändern; denn sie welsische Partei würde eine solche Berzicht- leistnng für erzwungen und für null «nd nichtig halten Die beNagen-werthe Erregung der Ge müther in den alten braunschweigisch-lüneburgi- schen Landen würde sortdauern, ja, verstärkt «erden. ES ist unter diesen Umständen ein Gtück zu nennen, daß der Prätendent seine Ansprüche aus- rechterhalten »nd gegen die ganze Ordnung der Dinge im deutschen Reiche Verwahrung eingelegt hat. Die Braunschweiger, bei denen die in Han nover herrschende jüngere Linie de» Welsen- bause» ohnehin schon immer nur wenig Sympathie gehabt hat, sahen ein, daß unter diesen Umstän den der Herzog von Cumberland keine Aussicht habe, in die Stadt Heinrich'» de» Löwen als re gierender Fürst einzuziehen. Man sieht indessen, daß die Braunschweiger am liebsten nach dem Tode de» Herzogs eine Regentschaft hätten, unter der Alles bnm Alten bliebe, bi» über die Erbfolge entschieden wäre. Also ein Proviso rium! Mit Recht erklärt sich Wilhelm Beseler argen ein solche- Provisorium und bemerkt: „Ein Provisorium in Fragen wie die vorliegende rst doch wobl nur gerechtfertigt, wenn e» ziemlich gewiß ist, wie der künftige Zustand sich gestalten wird und nur vorläufig dieser Gestaltung ein that- sächliches Hinderniß nn Wege steht. So liegt ja die Sache zum Beispiel, wenn es sich um einen minderjähngen Regenten handelt. Aber waS ge winnt man durch ein Provisorium, oder vielmehr warum ist eS überhaupt nothwendig, wenn gleich bei der Erledigung de» Throne» die Frage über da» Definitivum eben so aut theoretisch und prak tisch entschieden werden kann, wie nach Verlauf von so und so vielen Jahren? Da» heißt nicht» Andere», al» künstlich einen Zustand der Unsicher heit schaffen, der ganz gewiß am allerwenigsten »um Ruhen de» braunschweigischen Lande» ist." Den guten Braunschweigern gruselt es frei lich etwa» bei dem Gedanken, daß sie preußisch werden sollen. Sie denken bei Preußen an Steuer druck und an stramme hochnäsige Beamte, während ,ctzt Alle» gemüthlich und, wie man sieht, leidlich genug zugcht. Aber wa» kann da» Alle» helfen'? Der Zug der Zeit verringert beständig die Selbst ständigkeit und die Bedeutung der kleinen Staaten, ivenn er nicht gar ihr Ende herbeisührt. Für vraunschweig ist gar kein anderer Souverän her- beizuschaffev. al» der König von Preußen, »nd der alte Erbvertrag, kraft dessen nach AuSsterben einer welfischen Linie die Länder beider Linien wieder vereinigt werden sollen, kann nur aus diese Weise zur Ausführung kommen. Beseler bemerkt: „daß an leitender Stelle im Reich kein Zweifel mehr darüber herrscht, daß, selbst wenn der Herzog von Cumberland wider Erwarten anderen Sinne» werden sollte, doch nie mehr davon die Rede sein könnte, ihm die Regierung erne» deutschen Bundes staate» zu übertragen". Die Braunschweiger müssen sich also in da» Unvermeidliche fügen lernen, und die Pereinigung mit Preußen wird sich weit leidlicher heran», stellen, al» sie tbnlweise besorgen. In Preußen ist die Decentralisation der Verwaltung zum Grundsatz erhoben, und wie die Hannoveraner werden auch die Braun sch weiger sich einer ziemlichen Selbstständigkeit erfreuen Und wenn sie nach Hannover «nd Kassel blicken, die, seit sie keine Residenzen mehr sind, nicht abgenommen, sondern einen neuen, höchst erfreulichen Aufschwung genommen haben, so brauchen sie nicht zu besorgen, daß künftig in Braunschweig das Gra» auf den Straßen wachsen werde. Au» guter Quelle wird der „K. Z ", der wir oiese Ausführungen entnehmen, gemeldet: Es ist sicher und gewiß, daß alle Hoffnungen der Welfenpartei, ihren Prätendenten, etwa gegen Verzicht auf Hannover, al» souveränen Herzog in Braunschweig einueben zu sehen, ver geblich und nichtig sind. Alle», wa» seit dem Tode Georg'» V. vorgefallen ist, hat die preußi- s ch e Regierung in der Ansicht bestärkt, daß e» ganz unmöglich sei, den welfischen Prätendenten in Vraunschweig al» regierenden Fürsten einzu setzen. vielmehr ist dir preußische Regie- rung entschlossen, selbst einen Verzicht de» Herzog» von Cumberland nicht al» genügend zu betrachten, um ihm den Wel- kensond» auSzuliefern. vielmehr wird der Sohn de» König-Georg sich entschlie ßen müssen, nicht nur aus die Hannover* ichr, sondern auch auf die braunschweigi sche Erbfolge zu verzichten, wenn er den Selfenfond» au»g«l»efert erhalten will. Air meinen, der ritterliche Prinz, der in der Schlacht von Langensalza sein militairische« Genie dadurch bekundete, daß er, mit dem Backen von Eierkuchen beschäftigt, beinahe gesandt» worden wäre, wird schließlich doch sich mit den ihm reser- virten Millionen befreunden muffen. Mit diesem „Ausgleich" könnte Jedermann zufrieden fein Preußischer Lml-taz. G Berlin. 1k. Januar. Da» Tagesgespräch bildet heute überall die gestrige Rede de-Cult«»- minister», der man beinahe, wenn auch in rück blickender Weise, eine programmartige Bedeutung beimessen könnte. Auf der liberalen Seite des Abaeordnetenhause» war die Befriedigung Uber da» Hörle so allgemein, daß sowohl von der fort schrittlichen wie von der natümalliberalen Fraktion Mitglieder sich gleich nach der Sitzung aus den, Bureau einfanden, um sich eine größere An ,asil von Eremplaren de» amtlichen stenographischen Bericht» zu bestellen, die sie in ihren Wahlbezirken, besonder» in Leserkreisen, zur vertheilung bringen »ollen. Man Raubte au» der entschiedenen Hai tung de» Minister» entnehmen zu können, daß er mit der freie», offenen Weise, r» der er sich aus« gesprochen, trotz aller Machinationen der Hof predigerpartei, nach oben hin nicht anstoßen würde. Dre Gemeindecommifsion de» Abge ordnetenhauses beschäftigte sich mit einer Peti tion au» Martenfelde, betreffend die Staats- beihülfe zu ihren Gemeindelasten. Auf den An trag de- Berichterstatter», Aba Götting, faßte die Commission folgenden Beschluß: „Da» Hau» der Abgeordneten wolle die Petition der Gemeinde Marienfelde wiederholt der Kgl. StaatSregierung mit der Aufforderung überweisen, der petitioniren- den Gemeinde eine ihren Armenverhältnisieu ent sprechende Beihülfe, i» ähnlicher Weise wie solche der Gemeinde Marienau und Schäferei zu Theil geworden ist, zu gewähren." Die Commission schritt sooann zur Berathung einer analogen Petition au» den Rheinlanden. Seiten» der Commission wurde hierbei geltend ge macht, daß bei der Heranziehung de- FiScu» zu den Gemeindelasten die früheren gesetzlichen Be stimmungen nicht alterirt würden, während der RegieruugScommissar Die» al» unmöglich erklärte. Di« Mehrheit der Commission beschloß jedoch, die Petition der StaatSregierung zur Erwägung zu über weisen. Au» dem Umstande, daß der Name de- Abg. Knörcke unter dem vom Abg Richter (Hagen) eingebrachten, von der aesammten Fortschritts partei unterstützten Anträge wegen Regelung der Pensionsansprüche ver Lehrer fehlt, hat man schließen wollen, daß derselbe seinen Austritt au» der Fraktion erklärt habe oder erklären werde. Wie wir hören, ist da- Gerücht unbegründet. Der WahlmannSkörper de« vierten Berliner Land tag-Wahlkreise», den neben Knörckevirchow ver tritt, würde auch schwerlich mit einer solchen, wenigsten» anscheinenden Lossagung von der Partei einverstanden sein, klebrigen» hat jetzt anch da» Centrum (durch die Abgg. vr Röckerath, Kaufmann Porfch und v. Ludwig) beantragen lasten, da» Hau» der Abgeordneten wolle di« StaatSregierung auffordern, baldigst, jedenfalls aber in der nächsten Session, dem Landtage einen Gesetzentwurf vorzulegen, durch welchen eine ge setzliche Regelung der Alter-zulagen der Elementar lehrer herbeigesührt wird. In den Kreisen der Elementarlehrer wird man e» mit Genugthuung begrüßen, daß da» Ab geordnetenhaus alle auf da» LehrerdotationS- wcsen bezüglichen Anträge und Petitionen einer besonderen Commission von 14 Mitgliedern über wiesen hat. Die Commission ist heute gewählt und hat sich constitutrt. Damit ist die volle Ge- wißhe t gegeben, daß alle die einschlägigen Fraaen, insbesondere diejenigen der Alter-zulagen, der Pen sicnen, der Wittwenversorgung, einer gründlichen Prüfung werden unterzogen werden, aus welche gestützt da» Abgeordnetenhaus feine Beschlüsse fasten kann. Die Absicht einer derartigen zusammenfastenden und gründlichen Prüfung bestand schon feit längerer Zeit. Au» diesem Grunde wurde auch in der Sitzung vom 17. December von einer Besprechung der Interpellation de- Abg. Paur über ein Lehrer dotation-gesetz u. s. w. abgesehen, man wollte eben die Sache nicht, wie bet Interpellationen ge wöhnlich, im Sande verlaufen lasten. Um so mehr muß e» befremden, wenn die „Preußische Lehrerzeitung" den AuSgang jener Interpella tion, unter den gröbsten Schmähungen de» Abge ordnetenhause» im Allgemeinen und der Abgg. Rickert und Richter Hagen im Besonderen, so darstellt, al» wäre man über die Wünsche und Be schwerden der Lehrer mit absichtlicher Gering schätzung zur Tagesordnung übergeaangen. Diese Darstellung kann nur au» Unwissenheit oder au» BoSheit hervorgegangen sein; m beiden Fällen ist sie gleich unverantwortlich. Der Lehrer stand wird, denken wir, in einer derartigen Ver unglimpfung seiner aufrichtigsten Freunde gewiß n«cht leme geeignete Vertretung seiner Interessen erblicken wollen.

April 1872 und wendet sich darauf zur Beraibung de» Antrages de» Abg. v. Schor lemer-Al st: „die StaatSregierung aufzusordern, sofort eine eingehende und umsastend« Ermittelung eintreten zu lassen betreff- de» Bedürfnisse» und der Möglichkeit wirksamen legislativen Vorgehen- gegen den überhand nehmenden Wucher und die damit zu sammenbängenden schlimmen Folgen der allgemeinen Wechselfähigkeit." — Nachdem Abg. v. Schorlemer Alst diesen Antrag mit Hinweis darauf gerechtfertigt, daß die Antwort de- Justizminifter» auf seine, den selben Gegenstand betreffend« Interpellation ungenü gend gewesen sei, melden sich 18 Redner gegen, 6 für den Antrag. Der erste Redner gegen ist der Alm. ffr. LaSker, welcher in einer sehr langen Rede ausmnandcrsetzt, daßdi« allgrmeineWechselfäKgkeit schon seit 3vJahre» vestehe und somit kein Werk der heutigen liberalen Partei sei. Die Lufbebuna der Wucher aesetzr sei «in Werk der konservativen Partei und de» Fürsten BiSmarck. Werde der Wucher zum Betrage, so reich« da» Strafgesetzbuch Sich, aber einer Special- gesetzaebuna könne er nicht zustimmen. Mit solchen Anträgen komme man zu Nubt». de« Volk« köune nur m»t positiven Gesetzen geholfen werden, mit nega tiven Versprechungen aber führe man «» irre. Heb« man aber di« jetzigen Zustände auf, so zerstöre man die HülfSquellen, di« de, Grundbes^ bade. Mit Auf debung der Schuldhaft und Beschränk»»««, der Lohn beschlagnahme sei in erfolgreicher Weis« der Ausbeutung entgegengearbeitet undzwar mit Hülfe der Consrrva tiven. welche jetzt ihr Werk verleugnen.

(Sehr wahr! link» ) Redner schließt mit der Bitte um Ablehnung de» Anträge». (Lebhafter Beifall link». Zischen im Centrum.) — Inzwischen ist von den Abgg.vr. Nass« (freicons.) und Rickert (nationallib.) ein Antrag aufmotivirte Tagesord nung gestellt, in der Erwääung, daß die Vertretung deS deutschen Reiche» in Deutschland selbst in der Lage sei, solchen Beschwerden näher zu treten. — Abg. Hoffman« (Liegnitz) tritt den Ausführungen LaSker'» entgegen. Er verlangt au» ethischen und praktischen Gründen eine Aenderuna der Gesetz gebung. — Abg. Richter (Hagen) erklärt, daß der Vorredner sich nur in allgemeinen Redensarten er gangen und auf die trefflichen Ausführungen LaSker'S gar Nicht) erwidert habe. Der Redner widerlegt al-dann die Ausführungen v. Schorlemer». weist darauf hin, daß derselbe al» feststehend annehme, wa» erst durch die Enquete erwiesen werden sollte und schildert demnächst in drastischer Weise da» varleiische Verfahren der Enquetecommissionen, woraus sich ergebe, daß diesen Commissionen sehr aenaue Instructionen gegeben werden müßten. Die Eonservativen und da» Lentrum stimmten in den Ruf der Reaktion überein: Mehr Polizei und mehr Steuern! (Zustimmung). Die Ver wirrung, die in Deutschland bestehe, werde mit jedem derartigen Anträge noch erhöht. Mit dem Angriff auf die WechselfLkgkeit lege man zugleich die Axt an die Schulze-Delitz'schen Lassen und vernichte deren segensreiche Wirksamkeit. Fahre man mit diesen Agitationen fort, so werde man sehr bald die Strömung gegen sich wenden. (Lebhafter Beifall link»). Justizminifter Leonhardt; Ich habe bei einer trüberen Gelegenheit geäußert, daß die Regierung diesem Gegenstände ihr lebhafte» Interesse zugewendet. Wird der Antrag angenommen, so wird die Regierung ihn in Erwägung ziehen, ich glaube jedoch nicht, daß sie demselben Folge geben wird. E» handelt sich um eine Aenderung der Reichsgesetzgebung, die nur durch die Organe de» Reiche» erfolgen kann. ES werden vor der EntschnSung tbatsächftche Ermittelungen statt zufinden haben, die sich natürlich auf da- ganze ReichSgebirt zu erstrecken haben, die preußische Regie- rung kann eine solche Enquete nicht anstelle«. Sollte der Reichstag eine solche Enquete beschließen, so wird die Regierung der Durchführung derselben Schwierig keiten nicht entgegensetzen. Wie die Sache liegt, scheint eS mir richtig zu sein, wenn Sie den Antrag Raffe annehmen. Nachdem Abg. Reichensperger den Antrag Schorlemer. Aba. Nasse seinen Antrag gerechtfertigt, wird die DiScusston geschlvffen und Abg. v. Echor- lemer-Alft tritt zum Schluffe (als Antragsteller^ noch einmal den Ausführungen der Abgg.

Januar. Die von Herrn De- veaux vorgeschlagene Maßregel de- Papier geld Rückkäufe» hat bereit» ihre Wirkung ge- than und den Cour» auf 380 gedrückt und man kann bestimmt eine weitere Besserung desselben er warten. Die finanzielle Lage im Allgemeinen aber läßt Alle» zu wünschen übrrg. Die Regierung thut absolut Nicht» und die Mitglieder der Finanz-Commission erhalten häufig Beweise ihre» schleckten Willen». Zur Erhärtung de- eben Gesagten mögen einige Detail» über die letzten Dienstag stattge habte Sitzung hier Platz finden. Der französische Delegirte Mr Tricon verlangte zum letzten Male die Vorlage der osficiellen Dokumente, au» denen die Commissäre annähernd die Einnahmen und Ausgaben ersehen könnten, um da» Budget festzustcllen. Der Prä sident OhanneSTschumitsch antwortete, diese Dommente feien ihm noch nicht zugekommen; aber am Schlüsse der Sitzung machte er Mr. Tri- cou da» vertrauliche Geständuiß, daß die Regie rung die Mittheilung dieser Dokumente an Aus länder unbedingt verweigere. E» wäre den, nach unnütz, sie zu verlang«. In derselben Sitzung begehrte Mr. Tricon präcise Daten über die Au»gaben der Civi Niste. Ein Schrei de» Entsetzen» ging darob durch die ganze Versammlung. Der Armenier Allaverdi, ver auch Mitglied de- ottomaniscken Parlament war, rief mit bewegter Stimme: „Gott behüte, daß wir unsere Nacksorsckungen bi» aus die Aus gaben Sr. Majestät auSdehnen: da» Betreten diese» Terrain- soll verboten bleiven." Der französische Delegirte hatte viele Mühe, diese Skrupel zu begreifen und er ist nach wie vor der Neberzeugung, daß die jährlichen auf 40 bis 50 Millionen Livre» sich beziffernden Ausgaben de» kaiserlichen Palais mit der finanziellen Situation ve» Reiche» allzusehr contrastiren Der englische Commissionr-Delegirte Mr Harrifon wurde beauftragt, einen Specialbericht Uv« da» Handelsministerium zu verfassen Al ma» ihn srcyzt«, ob sein Bericht fertig sei, ant ««riete er ,n sarkastischem Tone: ..O ja; und dieser Bericht hat mich nicht viele Mühe gekostet Zuerst habe ich constatirt, daß es ein Handel»- mirnfterium gar nicht giebt. sondern nur eineu Miuister. Ich fand keine Statrstik. keinen regel mäßigen Ausweis Über die Haube!»bewegung, mit Einem Worte — Nichts. Mein Schlußantrag geht dahin, daß mau dm Posten de» H«mdel»minisierS auflassen müsse, was immerhin eine Ersparung wäre." In der Erkenntniß, daß der Zweck der Com- Mission nicht erreicht werden wird, haben sich die Commistaire Trico«, Mercel und Harrisou über folgenden Plan geeinigt: Sie wollen ver fache«, sich ohne Mithülfc der Regieruez aur8herr.dk Daten über die Ausgaben für die Armee, Mari« «ad Verwaltung zu verschaffen und diese Data zu veröffentlichen. Hierdurch wollen sie vor der Oeffentuchkeit dm Beweis erbringen, daß die Aus gaben der Türkei ihre Einnahmen weit übersteig», daß die ottomanische Regierung eine Verderb- liche Finanzpolitik verfolge, welche die europäische» Capitalistm unmöglich zu ermuthigen geeignet ist. der Türkei neuerlich Geld zu leihen. Die Wünsche «nd Hoffnungen de» Sultan» bezüglich einer eventuellen Garantie der frau- rösrschen Regierung für die projectirte Nu- leihc dürften sich demnach ungeachtet der neuest» Sympathie-Kundgebungen des Palai» und de-tür kischen Gouvernements für Frankreich und best» leitende Persönlichkeiten (siehe die Berleihung de» Medschidie-Großcordon» in Diamanten an Marschall Mac Mahon) schwerlich verwirklichen. Das« Stambul herrschende tiefe Elend hat, wie bekamt, neulich zur Unterzeichnung von Petitionm seit»» notabler Persönlichkeiten geführt, in welchen ler Sultan aufgesorvert rvrrd, die verwaltn»z de» Reiche» fremden Persönlichkeiten a»> zu vertrauen. Da die Polizei diese Kund- zebuugm verbot, wurdm i« selben Ginne abgesagte Plakate an dm Thoren der Moscheen angeschlagen und e» regt sich unter dm Effendi'S in Stamk»! neuerlich ein bedenklicher Geist, welcher die Wieder holung von Ereignissen nicht unmöglich erscheine, läßt, von welchen der Thron de» Khalism in da letzten Äahrm wiederholt bedenklich asficirt worden ist « » Eine drastische Ergänzung zu der vorstehend» Correspondenz liefert der Telegraph, indem er der in Konstantinopel herrschenden Ratblosigkeir wie folgt Ausdruck verleiht: Konstantinopel, 1k.

Leipzig' 17. Januar. Da- Echiller'sche Frag ment de- „DemetriuS" ging gestern mit der Heinrich Laube'schen Fortsetzung seit längerer Zeit wieder einmal in Scene. Während die Reichs- tagSscene im ersten Acte de- Schiller'schen DemetriuS und der Monolog der Marfa im »weiten zu den Glanzpartien Schiller'scher Dramatik gehören, die erste wegen der vorzüglichen Führung eine- viel- stimmigen dramatischen Ensemble-, der zweite wegen seine- hohen dichterischen Schwünge-, hat Laube in seiner Fortsetzung nur ein auf Bühnenwirkung be rechnete- Theaterstück geschrieben und da»u die Schiller'schen Aufzeichnungen mit Geschick ver- werthet. Dagegen muß der Abstand zwischen dem oft trivialen Laube'schen Stil und dem schwung haften, vom echten dichterischen Genius getra genen Schiller'S selbst einem für dichterisch« Schönheit wenig enrvfänglichen Ohr auffallen. Der Poesie Laube's fehlen alle Schwungfedern, doch steht Demetrius hierin noch wert hinter „Essex" zurück. Wenn Marsa mit ihrem zündenden Prachimonoloa, den freilich die neueren Realisten für eine überflüssige Deklamation- eine regelrechte Annexion verwandeln. Wie wir hören, verwahrt man sich hier gegen diese Insinuation der Petersburger diploma- iischen Agenten, mdem daraus hingewiesen wird, daß schon während deS hiesig«,» Con- S"sse« von allen Mächten die Einführung eine- I worden ' ist7 'von'"dem MVnisterpräsidenten'°De milttatrischeuReglmeSOcsterreichs ,n BoSmen alS pr et iS und dem französischen Botschafter rothwendlg erkannt wurde.

C,ar BoclS Goduno ' sramdete R^ierungen und wohl auch an die I ^nstigten Nation. In Italien sei Oester- " Asige zur Kenntmßnahme mitgetheilt worden, »reich-Ungarn die meistbegünstigte Nation. In BlS zur Stunde ist von keiner ver Congreß- " ^ - — Mächte ein Protest gegen daS Berfahren Oester reichs resp gegen die Verletzung deS Art. 25 deS Berliner Vertrages erfolgt und nach der bier herrschenden Auffassung wird ein solcher auch I mcht erfolgen. Dem Erwerb Bo-nienS und der i den sehr große» Bortheil, ein herzliche- Ei .Herzegowma durch Oesterreich wird von den I ^bmen mit Frankreich bezüglich der cou Slgnatarmachten stillschweigend zugestimmt. Ueber > «na-l-aenb-it-n wi,d-r kerruitellen i diesen Punct ist man hier schon lange im Klaren und wie sich Oesterreich mit den Subtilitäten Un garn- dabei abfindet, läßt BiSmarck gleichgültig. Man schreibt uns auS Berlin: Innerhalb der hiesigen Bürgerschaft hat daS Schreiben deS Kronprinzen an den Minister deS Innern auS Anlaß der projectirten Geschenke an da- kaiserliche Ehepaar zu deren goldener Hochzeit eine Deutung erfahren, die dem von« Kronprinzen au-gesprochenen Wunsche Rechnung tragen soll Indem Derselbe wünscht, daß persönliche Geschenke Unterlasten bleiben, hingegen die Begründung Frankreich würden die italienischen Maaren wie spanische, schwedische :c. behandelt werben. Die „Italic" fügt hinzu, daß der neue Vertrag eine namhafte Verbesterung de« Handelsverkehrs beider Länder zu einander bilde. Derselbe habe Einver- commer- ziellen Angelegenheiten wieder herzustellen, indem er Italien wieder von der Anwendung der allge meinen, die beiderseitigen HandelSinteresten so schädigenden Tarife abkommen laste. Dieses vor läufige Uebereinkommen gewähre der Regierung somit Muße, einen definitiven Handelsvertrag auSzuarbeiten, welcher 1880 in Kraft treten kann. Godunow beginnt, seine Verdienste um Rußland im Stil eines Leitartikel- au-einander- zusetzen und besonders seine Straßenbauten zu rühmen: so ist unS zu Mutbe, als wenn wir auS dem Himmel der Dichtung, den ZeuS dem Poeten geöffnet hat, dorthin versetzt werden, wo man poetische Reime am Heerweg klopft. Mindesten- der Gleichartig keit des Stils wegen hätte Laube doch solche reali stische KraftauSdrücke, wie: „er ist wie toll", „er ist wie verrückt", „er ist ein geiziger Lump", „eS ist ein Hundeleben", vermeiden sollen, wenn er gleich auf der anderen Seite in seinen poetischen Bildern so un glücklich wie möglich ist: Barmherziger Gott, und Haft Du Unterlasten Der Mutter, die daS Kind geboren hat, Ein unzerstörbar Werkzeug einzuprägen, Ein Werkzeug, welches spricht und welches schreit. Wenn Kind und Mutter endlich sich begegnen Ein der Mutter eingeprägteS Werkzeug, welches spricht und schreit! Doch Laube erklärt ja selbst, daS Stück für daS Theater und nicht für die Literatur geschrieben zu haben; er entwaffnet damit derartige Vorwürfe, indem er damit zugleich andeutet, daß m Deutschland gute Theaterstücke keinen literarischen Werth zu haben brauchen.

Article: Ramses IX. war der 8. altägyptische König (Pharao) der 20. Dynastie (Neues Reich) und regierte von 1128/1127 bis 1109 v. Chr.

Weitere Namen 
 Goldname: Reich an Jahren wie Anedjti, mit großem Königtum, der die Neun Bogen (die Feinde Ägyptens) bezwingt

Abstammung und Familie 
Seine Abstammung ist umstritten. Edward F. Wente vermutet in Ramses IX. einen Sohn Ramses VI. und damit Bruder Ramses VII. K. A. Kitchener hielt ihn anfänglich für einen Sohn Ramses VIII. und nun für einen Sohn des Prinzen Montuherchepschef und damit Enkel Ramses III.

Aidan Dodson hält Tachat für seine Mutter und Bakenwerel für seine Gemahlin (bisher für Mutter und Gemahlin Amenmesses' gehalten). Beide sind in KV10 im Tal der Könige bestattet. Nebmaatre, Hohepriester in Heliopolis (Bautätigkeit), und Montuherchepschef (KV19 im Tal der Könige) gelten als Söhne Ramses IX. Sein Nachfolger ist Ramses X. Er ist – je nach Forschungsmeinung – sein Sohn oder Schwiegersohn, dessen Gemahlin Titi Tochter oder Schwiegertochter.

Herrschaft 
Sicher belegt ist das 17., möglicherweise auch das 19. Regierungsjahr.

Aufgrund einer wirtschaftlichen Krise, Einfällen von Libyern und der Korruption der Beamten (an ihrer Spitze der Bürgermeister von Westtheben Pawera) kommt es zur Plünderung königlicher und privater Gräber durch organisierte Banden. Von der Arbeit der untersuchenden Kommission und den Grabräuberprozessen (Jahr 16/17) berichten mehrere berühmte Papyri wie beispielsweise der Papyrus Abbott. Die Schuldigen wurden gepfählt. Unter Ramses XI. kommt es aber zu weiteren Plünderungen.

Hohepriester in Theben waren nacheinander: Ramsesnacht, Nesamun und Amenhotep.

Bautätigkeit 
Ramses IX. Bautätigkeit ist bezeugt durch sein großes Grab KV6 im Tal der Könige. Dies hat eine Länge von 86 m. Weitere Zeugnisse sind Denkmäler in Heliopolis (Statuen, Opfertisch, Tordurchgänge), Memphis (Stele, Fragmente, Apisbegräbnis), Karnak (Dekoration von Mauer und Tordurchgang zum Hof nördlich des 7. Pylons, Stele, Inschrift über Auszeichnung des Hohepriesters Amenhotep). Kleinere Objekte und seine Kartuschen finden sich in Medinet Habu, Amara-West, Dachla, Antinoë und Gezer in Palästina (sekundär?). Für Ramses II., Ramses III. und Ramses VII. stiftet er einen Doppelopferständer.

Tod und Bestattung 

Nach seinem Tod wird Ramses IX. in dem für ihn errichteten Grab bestattet (Fund von vermutlich Kufen eines Sarkophagschlittens). Die Mumie wird aber zusammen mit anderen in der 21. Dynastie in die Cachette von Deir el-Bahari umgebettet.

Der Pharao starb, bevor das Grab vollständig gebaut worden war. Ein Teil einer Säulenhalle und die eigentliche Grabkammer waren noch nicht vollständig behauen.

In den 70 Tagen zwischen Tod und Bestattung des Pharao wurden die Steinmetzarbeiten nicht mehr weitergeführt, sondern die Grabkammer wurde schnellstmöglich ausgemalt.

Des brasilianischen Prasidenten Peixoto Torpedoboote „ Panne “ und „ Pernambuco “ sind wegen der Unzulänglichkeit der Mannschaft gezwungen , in Bahia einen Dampfer abzuwarten , der sie süd warts schleppen soll. Die Katastrophe auf dem Panzerschiff Brandenburg. Nach der vom Dezernenten im Reichs marine = Amt Geheimrat Laugner am 17.

Viele hatten die Arme in die Luft gestreckt , als ob sie die die Gefahr im letzten Augenblick noch von sich ab wenden wollten Mehrere Arbeiter halten noch Twist in den verbrühten Handen. Die Stiefeljohlen der Verunglückten sind infolge der großen Hite geplag : und das Leder ist ganz zu sammenzeschrumpft. Die Leichen der später gestordenen Schwerverwundeten zeigien entsetzliche Brandwunden. Bei fast allen höhern Beamten hat ein tragisches Miß. geschick gewaltet , denn sie haben zum Teil in Ver tretung die Probefahrt mitgemacht. Reserve = Ingenieur Schultz ein Kieler Kaufmann , hätte am Samstag seine Uebung beendigt gehabt , wäre er nicht einen Tag vorher der unseligen Katastrophe zum Opfer gefallen. Er hatte sich frei willig zur Dienstleistung auf Panzer „ Brandendurg " gemeldet , um die neuen Moschinen kennen zu lernen. Auch der ums Leden gekommene Maschinenbaumeister der kaiserlichen Werft , Ofers , war in Stellvertretung an Bord des Schiffes komman diert , desgleichen der Ingenieur Merks. Ofers und Merks sind von der heißen Dampfen im Zwischendeck etwa 8 Meter von dem Eingang zur Maschine ereilt und tol zu Boden gefallen. Die Kochmaate sind in ihren Combusen ( Küche ) verbrannt. Die Deckoffizier = und Offiziercombusen liegen zu beiten Seiten der Maschienausgänge. Ein Stewart war in seiner Angst in ein Spind gekrochen und hatte die Thar hinter sich ge schlossen. Der arme Mairose ist später verbruht in dem Be hälter als Leiche gefunden worden. Angesichts der schrecklich entstellten Opfer kann man erst ermessen , welche Wirkung der heiße Dampf ausgeübt hat. Aus dem Privatbrief eines jungen Mannes , der zur Zeit auf dem Panzerschiff „ Brandenburg " dient und der bei der alle Katastrophe mit knapper Not dem Tode entgangen ist , werden im „ Köln. Stadtanz. noch folgende Einzelheiten mitgetheilt : „ Wir waren drei Stunden gefahren und in offener See , als sich das fürchterliche Unglück ereignete. Ich defand mich gerade oberhalb der Maschine , als ich plotzlich ein starkes Rauschen vod Brausen hörte. Ich wollte mich zu dem Ort begeben nachsehen , was da los sei. Gleichzeitig klang aber auch schon ein schmerzliches Geschrei an mein Ohr , und auf dem Wege zur Maschine kam mir ein solcher Druck und eine solche ins Gesicht , daß ich sofort zu Boden fiel. In angst raffte ich mich auf und lief ich zum Bullauge ( Fenster ) , drückte mich mit aller Kraft hindurch und wollte schnell über Bord springen , als ich über mir die Ankerbefestigung bemerkte , darnach griff und mich daran festklammerte. Der Ruf erscholl „ Sämmtliche Boote klar ! " Alle Rettungsboote wurden in See gesetzt und mit Mannschafften besetzt , da man glaubte , das Schiff werde in die Luft fliegen. Nachdem festgestellt worden , daß das Schiff keinen Leck hatte , ging alles wieder an Bord , um zu sehen , was eigentlich los sei. Der Kommandant , der erste Offizier drangen mit 15 Matrosen in den Maschinen raum , wo es stockfinster war , da das elektrische Licht ausgegangen war. Aus dem Maschinenraum drang ein betäubender Geruch empor. Schnell wurden Laternen angezündet , und unsern Augen bot sich nun ein entsetzlicher Anblick. Ueberall sahen wir entstellte und verstummelte Leichen. Mehrere Matrosen wurden beim Anblick dieses Elends ohnmächtig. wurde die ganze Besatzung herbeigerufen und Freiwillige auf gefordert , sich zu melden , um die Leichen an Deck zu schaffen. Kaum waren die Leute über die heißen Treppen in den Maschinenraum gelangt , als wieder mehrere in Ohnmacht fielen bei dem fürchterlichen Anblick , der sich ihnen vot. Ii kann nicht beschreiben , wie es uns zu Mute war , einige Leichen nach oben schafften ; die meisten von uns wurden ohnmächtig. Inzwischen war das Notfignal gehißt worden und nach und nach trafen von den andern Schiffen Lazareit gehilfen und Aerzte ein. Das Schiff trieb auf offeuer See ; es konnte nicht fahren , weil kein Dampf mehr vorhanden war. Die Leichen mußten behutsam angefaßt werden , da sie beinahe auseinanderfielen ; sie waren soztsagen gekocht. Ich kann Euch , meine Lieben , nicht alles erzählen ; ich bia noch ganz erschüttert von dem Vorfau. Wir können von Glück sagen , daß nicht das ganze Schiff in die Luft geflogen ist , denn in den Kesseln war kein Dampf mehr und die Feuer mußien schnell ausgespritzt werden. “ , 9 Ein weilerer Augenzeuge der Katastrophe als vem Pauzer „ Brandenburg " erzählt in einem gestern in Berlin eingetroffenen Briefe an Verwandte über den unglücklichen Vorfall folgendes : „ Als die Explosion erfolgte , hatte man von der Größe der Gefahr noch keinen Begriff , Ingenieure und Maschinisten glaubten durch mutvolles personliches Eingreisen etwalges Ungluck noch verhindern zu können. So befand sich z. B. Ingenteur Merks , der zur Schiffsprüfuagskommission gehörte und deshalb die Probefahrt mitmachen mußie , gerade im Zwischendeck ( Raum über der Maschine ). Ein Maschinist erfaßte ihn am Arme und nief ihm Ju :. 94 Herant , der Joguckhe. Doch Ingenieur Merks riß sich eos und eilte nach der anderen Seite , der Unfallstelle zu. Der Maschinist war gerettet — den Ingenieur fand man nach 1½ Stunden als Leiche ; er hatte in dem Dampf nich wieder zurückfinden können. Au der Schottthur zur zweiten Schiffsmaschine fand man 14 Leichen übereinander , im Lichtmaschinenraum edenso viele. Der ausstromende Dampf — 12 Atmosphären bei 187 Celsius Hitze — tödtete alle fast augendlicklich : Ein Heizer stard mit der Schausel in der Hand , in gebückter Stellung , wie er eden Kohlen aufschaufeln wollte. Maschinistenmaate hielten den Twist krampfhaft in der skelettirten , Hand oder den Meiße ! die Feile. Der eins Matrose , Koch , wurde als Leiche , an die Komduse gelehnt , gesunden , in der Hand eine Kartoffel , die er gerade schalen wollte. — Die Leichen sehen schrecklich Einen Obermaat “ der nicht gerade schmächtig ist , trieb die Todesangst durch eine Lucke , die er sonst nur für groß genug zum Kopfdurchstecken gehalten hatte. Die Offiziere , welche in ihren Kammern waren , um nicht zu ersticken , den Kopf , so wett es ging , aus den Sulaugen beraustreden. Große Umsicht bewies ein junger Ingeneur Momting ; zu nachst stellie er trotz des schon einstromenden Dampfes die zweite Schiffsmaschine ad — der Maschinist , der ihm dabei dehulflich war , ist seinen Verletzungen erlegen — , dann erst reitete er sich in einen leeren Vorratsraum , der tiefer als die Maschine liegt. Dorihin hatten sich auch sechs Werstardeiter ereitet. Nach wenigen Minuten aber machte der ein ströwende Dampf den Aufenthalt hier gleichfalls un möglich. Eine Luke unten am Deck führte , wie Ingenieur M. wußte , in einen „ Wassertank ". Diese Luke li er öffnen und die Arbeiter hineinkriechen Ein schon schwach gewordener Mann mußte geschleppt werden. Ingenieur M. kroch als Letzter nach und schraubte die Luke von unt u fest. Vor Dampf waren sie unn gerettet , aber in dem engen Raume , in dem sie sich kaum rühren konnte und der seine einzige Lustzufuhr durch even jene Luke datte , ging dald der Sauerstoff aus. Schwerer und schwerer atmeten die Leute und wollten mit Gewalt die Luke öffnen. Doch Ingenieur M. rief ihnen zu , daß er den Ersten niederschlagen wurde , der Hand an den Verschluß legen sollte , die Gefahr werde bald voruder sein ! Durch fortwädrendes Klopsen an die eisernen Wände suchten sich die Eingeschossenen demerkdar zu machen und nach schrecklich 25 Minuten wurden sie auch glücklich gerettet. Hatten die Leute die Luke geöffnet , so würden ste alle sofort zu Tode verchtäiht workten , ig. Wegrsien ua B. Wäre das Unglück etwas spater anselerten , W0 die gesammte Mannschaft in Zwischendeck beim Essen gesessen hätte , oder wäre es gar in der Nacht geschehen , sogwürde das Schiff ein einziges Leichenfeld geworden sein. “ dem auarchistischen Lager.

Aus Nah und Fern. Berlin , 22. Februar , lieber die von dem Kaiser den vier Flügel = Kompognieen des ersten Garde = Regiments zu Fuß an seinem Dienst = Jubilaumstage verliehenen neuen Grenadier mutzen sind manche nicht zutreffende Nachrichten in die Oeffent keit gelangt. Der Plan , das erste Garde = Regiment zu Fuß mit Grenadiermützen genau nach dem Muster , wie sie unter Fried rich dem Grozen getragen wurden , zu versehen , verdankt einem eigenen Gedanken des Kaisers seine Entstehung und Aus führung. Seit Ende Dezember v. J. wurde rastlos an der Herstellung , unter Beobachtung der strengsten Verschwiegenheit gessbeitel. Daß die Geheimhaltung bis zur letzten Minute ge wahrt blieb , ist um so mehr anzuerkennen , als ungefähr 80 Arbeiter inn der Anfertigung beschäftigt waren , die in dem Glauben lebten , daß es sich um eine größere militärische Auf führung handle , da die liefernde Firma fast ausschließlich die sämtlichen Ausrüstungen u. s. w. für die königlichen Theater zu besorgen pflegt. Der Kaiser wollte eben das Regiment wirklich überraschen , und wie bekanni , ist ihm dies auch im vollsten Maße gelungen. Die neuen Grenadiermutzen sind nicht aus Aluminium verfertigt ; den meiallenen Teil derselben bilder viel mehr eine genau nach dem Muster der unter Friedrich dem Großen getragenen Grenadiermutzen gestanzte und darauf stark versilberte Messingplatte , die nicht geputzt werden darf. Unterschied in diesen Platten fur die Offiziers = und Mann schaftsmützen besteyt nicht , nur die Pompons und die Litzen die den ruckwartigen Teil der Mutzen zieren , sind für die Offi ziere aus versilberter bezw. vernickelter Drahiarbeit , während jene der Unteroffiziere und Mannschaften aus Wolle hergestell sind. Da der hintere Teil der neuen Kopfbedeckungen bei den beiden ersten Vataillonen aus roten , bei dem Fusilien = und dem vierten Batcillon aus gelbem Wollstoff besteht , so sind dem entsprechend auch die Pompous bei den ersteren aus roter und weißer , bei den letzteren aus gelbe = und weißer Wolle. Die versilberte Messingpiatte trägt auf einem ebenfalls versilberten und über dem Adler angebrachten Messingbande bei den beiden ersten Vataillonen den durch den Koiser bereits für die alten Gieradiermützen eingsführten Wahlspruch. „ Semper talis “ , bei. n beiden letzten Baiaillonen , also auf den gelden Gceuadier mützen , den altern Wahlspruch „ pro gloris et patria “.

Frau Klahm hat im ganzen 12 Kindern das Leben gegeben ; davon leben bis gestern noch drei , und zwal außer den vorgenannten ein 16jähriger Sohn , der als Austrager in einer Buchhandlung beschäftigt wird. Schon vor längerer Zeit hatte einmal die Frau einen Zeitel auf den Tisch gelegt , der für ihren Mann die Worte enthielt : „ Wenn Da dieses liest , bin ich nicht mehr unter den Lebendeu. " Damals gav die unglückliche Frau ihren Vorsatz auf. Gestern hat sie wilder einen Zeitel au ihren Ehemann hinterl. ssen , der die Worte trug : Mein lieber Mann , Du bist jer # frei. Ich kann die Kinder nicht mehr hungern sehen. “ Dieser Inhalt deutei darauf hin , daß die Frau Klaym sich in einem Zustande der Unzurechnungsfahigkeit besunden haben muß ; denn ihr Mann forgle in ausglediger Weise für selne Angehörigen. Die That muß gegen Mittag begangen worden sein , deun um 12 Uhr hat eine im vierten Stock wohnende Frau gehört , wi : die Tour zu der Klahmschen Wohnung ver schlossen wurde.

Aog. Bebel fiimmte dem Antrag zu ; ein offenes Geheim nis sei es , daß wassenLaft Penstonierungen un Interesse eines reschern Abancemen : s vorgenommen wurden. Der Kriegsminister erklärte , die Zahl der Pensioaierungen habe nicht unver dlt eismaßig zugenommen. Die Geünde der Verabschiedung frien sehr verschieden ; die Offiziere suchten viel satz Adschied nach , weil sie füelten , daß sie ihter Stellung nicht mehr gewachsen seien Es sei richtig , daß in kive Offiziere im Kriegsfall wertvolle Dienste leisteren ; dies geicheye ader in Stellungen , wo geringere Forderungen an sie gestellt werden. ( Beifall rechts. ) Abg. wedel führte aus , er sei durch den Kriegsminister nicht überzeugt , und behaupteie , daß die abeligen Ofiztere selbst bei der Artillerie bevorzugt würden.

Beim Etat der Justizverwaltung brachten die Abgg. Salisch ( kons. ) und Sachte ( Hosp. der kons. Partei ) verschiedene Mißstande des Standesamis zur Sprache. Staatssekre är Ni berding erklärte , im Großen und Gauzen habe die Einrichtung des Slandesamis = Registers sich beodort ; einzelne Mißstande unterliegen der Prufung der Justizver waltung. Auf eine Anftage des Abg. Bachem gab Staats sekretär Nieberding eine Darlegung des Forganges der Ar beiten am Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch. Das Werk durfie im Spät herost 1895 vollendet sein , da die Bundesregierungen geneig # sind , auf eine Prufung im Einzeinen durch den Bundesrat zu verzichten.

An Tage derun , Wolb ich Insassin des Zuchthauies. Ginsnechen Piuen wraungen redentun gecbe ich binweg und berühre nur das Eine , das Ntumnags vollste , was damals in mein Leden eingriff und uich i higen. des Verchrechens gefabn hoi , Konsequenzen heute dazu zwingt , endlich Ruhe d Frieven vort zu suchen , wo keiner mehr sie uns streitig machen kann. „ Jei den üglichen Spaziergängen im Garten der Strof welche mir gewährt wurden , sah mich der Gartner Planck und wurde , vielleicht auch infolge eines tiesen Mitleids , das er mit mir und meinem Lose empfand , von heißer Leiden shent für mich entflammt. Er teilte mir das mit auf kleinen. , Nliedenen Zetteln , die er mir in die Hände zu spielen wußte , unv setzte es sich in den Kopf , mich zu befreien und dann zu seinem Weibe zu machen. Ich hielt ihn für einen Halbuarren , auf dessen Plaue und Vorsatze kein großes Gewicht zu legen sei , glaubte auch weder an den Ernst seiner Absichten , noch au eine sich für mich daraus ergebende Gefahr. Ich hatte nur ein Bedauern für seine waghalsigen Tollheiten und ließ ih durch den Warter , der sich manchmal hatte bereit finden lassen , mir Botschaften von ihm zu überbringen , ausrichten , er möge auf der Hut sein und sich seine tollen Ideen vergehen lassen , da ich weder befreit zu werden wünsche , noch je seinen Wünschen meiner Entlassung aus der Strafanstalt Gehör geben W Er liess sich aber durch das alles nicht irre machen. Wiche Volbereitungen er dann getroffen halte , um den toll kuhnen Entschluß , mich zu befreien , wirklich ins Werk zu setz. n , weiß ich nicht ; nur soviel , das man ihm auf die Spur kam und daß er eines Tages Tages schimpflich entlossen wurde , wayrend meine Haft eine strengere wurde , als bisher. Danu hörte ich bis zum Ablauf meiner Strafzeit nichts mehr von ihm und freute mich dessen. Ich glaube , ich vergaß ihn sogar. Um so größer war mein Schreck , als er mir nach meiner Ent lassung , die er abgewartet hatte , sofort wieder in den Weg trat und nun seine fruhere Werbung leidenschaftlich erneuerte , ja , sich durch das , was geschehen war , ein Recht darauf erworben zu haben wähnte , erhört zu werden. Ich suchte ihm in der mildesten Form alle seine Hoffnungen für immer zu benehmen , erreichte aber bei dem in einer frren Idee befangenen Manne nichts anderes , als daß er mir zuschwor , mich nie aufgeben zu können , mich auf allen meinen Lebenswegen so lange verfolgen zu wollen , bis ich endlich sein geworden sei. Ich ging damals zunächst in meinen Heimatsort zurück , wohin meine erblindete totkranke Mutter sich zurückgezogen hatte , um dort zu sterben. Ich kam gerade noch zur rechten um ihr die Augen zuzudrücken. Mein Wohlthater , der Pfarrer , hatte ihr im Laufe der Zeit alles der Wahrheit entsprechend mitgeleilt , es nicht übers Herz gebracht , sie in einem Irrtum gefangen zu halten. Das mochte ihren Tod , so vorsichtig er auch zu Werke gegangen war , freilich beschleunigt haben. Aber trotz alledem waren ihre letzten Worte an mich solche der Ver gebung. Dann schlummerte sie in meinen Armen hinüber. Ich stand nun ganz allein auf der Welt und hatte kein Heim auf Erden. Mein Onkel Lebrecht , trotzdem er den Schurkenstreich , den Leo in haldem Wahnsinn gegen mich verübt , kannte , konnte mir nie vergessen , daß ich den Tod seines Erstgeborenen , wenn auch wahrscheinlich wider meinen Willen , verschuldet halte. Ich hätte freilich auch niemals mich an seine Gnade wenden wollen. Es drangte mich überhaupt , außer Landes zu kommen. Nur in der Fremde konnte ich noch ein mal aufzualmen wagen , nur dott würde man von dem Makel nichts wissen , der an mir kiedie , nur dort durfte ich mich sicher wahnen und meine Augen frei emporheden. Der heimische Boden brannte mir unter den Füßen , ich glaubte immer , daß man mit Fingern auf mich zeige , daß man g heimuisvoll tuschelle und mit den Augen zwinkerte , wann und wo ich voruberkam. Dieses Grauen vor den Menschen konnte nur aufhören , wenn ich unter einem andern Himmel lebte. Wieder war es der Pfarrer , welcher mich einst liebevoll bei sich aufgenommen , dem ich nun die Erfullung meines Wun sches verdankte. Er verschaffte mir eine Stellung als Gesell schafierin bei einer alten ewig krankelnden Dame , welche seit Jahren im Süden lebte und von Kurort zu Kurort zog. Es haite niemand lange bei ihr ausgehalten. Sie pflegte die jungeren und ältereren Fräuleins , die sich in ihre Nahe wagten , um iyr Pflege und Unterhaltung zu gewähren , durch ihre Lau nen , ihre Verditterung und ihre Herrschsucht zu vertreiben. Ich wußte das alles , ebe ich meine Stellung antrat. Der Pfarrer schenkte mir volle Offenheit ; was keine ertragen konnte , wurde ich ertragen , meinte er , und je schwerer mir das wurde , um so eher konne ich glauben , dadurch zu suhnen. was ich # # # sehlt habe. So ging ich und darf mir wohl das Zeugnis ausstellen , geduldig getragen zu haben , was manch mal — oft über Menschenmaß hinauszugehen schien. Es war eine Art von Wollust , mit der ich das alles über mich ergehen ließ , weil dadurch der Makel von mir abgewaschen zu werden schien , der mein Leden verdunkelte. Wir zogen jahrelang in der Ferne ruhelos umher. Nur einmal wurde das trube Einerlei dieses Daseins mir durch einen Brief von Friedrich Plauck unterbrochen , der — ich weiß nicht wie ? — meinen Aufenthaltsort ausgekundschaftet hatte und mir nun abermals antrug , sein zu werden. Auch damals denahm ich ihm durch meine Antwort wiederum jegliche Hoffnung und glaubte mich wie sei her vor ihm gedorgen. Dann sah mich in einer Fremdenpension in Territet am Genfer See Leopold Haseler , der seit einigen Jahren in der Welt umherreiste , um seinen Schmerz über den Verlust seiner Gaitin zu betauden. Er faßte sofort eine leidenschaftliche Zu neigung zu mir und besturmte mich mit seiner Werdung. Ich schwankte lange Zei. Daß ich ihn nicht liebte , ihn ute lieden wurde , wußte ich , aber ich hatte überhaupt noch nie einen Mann geliebt und allen Grund , daran zu zweifeln , daß ich solcher Liede fähig sei. Ich achlets und ehrte Leopold Haseier , mein Mitieid mit ihm war rege , ich sah nach seinen Schilde rungen ein weites Feld für eine nutzenbringende Thätigkeit im Diense der Menscheuliebe auf seinen Besitzungen für mich voraus. Ich konnte diesen Mann , der mich anbetete , glucklich machen und durch ihn für Hun erte im werkthatigen Christen tum wirken und schaffen. Das war ' s , was mich schließlich be wog , ihm meine Hand zu reichen. Wir wurden winige Wochen später vermählt , und ich kim hierher. Alles gestallete sich hier für mich aufs Glücklichste , ein neues , verheißungsvolles Leben begann. Ich war weit genug fort von den Statten meiner Jugend und meines Unglucke , um mich hier unter Menschen eines anderen Sch ' ages , die von meiner Vergaugenheit nichts wußten , sicher zu glanden Leo pold # ug mich 3 f Handen , und ich konnte für hundert arme. unglucliche Menschen ein menschenwurdigeres Los schaffen , mich ich wemeester , Douldalkeit und Vereheuag glücklich fadien. G —. ule , daß der Baun , der auf meinem Dasein gelegen , von mir genommen sei , daß ich gesühnt hatte , daß Frieden in mir werden wurde. Ich täuschte mich ditter. Der düstere Schatten auß meiner Vergangenheit reckte sich abermals vor mir herauf und verdunkelte mir dald die freundlich stille Heiterkeit meines Daseins , ja , ein Wetter zog auf , das mich alebald mit seinem Blitz treffen und zerschmeitern soll : e. Eines Tages , als ich den Stadtwald durchwanderte , stand Friedrich Plonu vor mir. Iy erschrak so defug , daß ich zitierte. Mir wur s , als sei meine tot und begraben gewähnte Vergangenheit plotzlich wiedrrum lebendig geworden. Ich wollte fliehen aber Plauck trat mir in den Weg , ein höhnisches , hald irtes Lachein um die Lippen , und redete zu mir. Er sagte mir , daß er seit einigen Tagen in der Försterei angestellt sei , daß er nur um meinetwillen hierhergekommen , nachdem er end lich nach vielen Bemuhungen meinen Aufenthalt erfahren habe. und daß ich nun in seiner Gewalt sei. „ Aber was wollen Sie jetzt noch von mir ? “ fragte ich ihn entsetzt , „ ich din ver mählt. “ Das wisse er , lautete seine Antwort , alles wisse er , aber das andere für itu nichts ; er woll : mich , er müsse mich besitzen , und ich solle mit ihm fliehen ; ich wies dies wahn witzige Anfinnen entrüstet zurück , ader Planck lachelte nur zu allem , was ich sagte. Ich dat ihn , ich flehte ihn an , von seiner tollen Idee abzunehen , ich machte ihm das Uuerhörte , das Verdrecherische seiner Wunsche klar , ich schwor ihm , daß ich meinem Manne treu bleiden würde , daß ich nie für ihn eine Zuneigung empfunden hatte oder je empfinden konne — es war alles umsonst. „ Ich werde Sie zwingen, “ sagts er. „ Wodurch ? “ fragte ich zuternd. Und er lachette abermals. „ Durch die Preisgebung Ihres Geheimnisses. Weder Ihr Galte , noch sonst jemand hier ahnt etwas davon , wo ich Sie gesehen habe , wo ich ihnen zuerst meine Liede eingestand. Ihr Schicksal liegt also in meiner Hand , ich kann Sie vernichten , wenn Sie mir nicht zu Willen sind. Sie leben hier in An sehen und Eyren , sind reich und werden als eine Art Heilige hochgehalten. Wenn ich den Menschen erzähle , daß Sie eine Zuchthäuslerin sind , wird das alles anders werden. Ihr Galte wird Sie verstoßen , weil Sie ihn belogen und getäusch haben , und die anderen werden sich mit Emporung und hamischer Schadenfreude von Ihnen abwenden. Bedenken Sie ich also wohl , ehe Sie mich so fortschicken ; ich din mächtiger , als Sie denken. ". ( Fortsetzung folgt. ) nem Abend hatte er ein Berliner Stimmungsbilder.

Article: Das Theoretische Lyzeum Adam Müller-Guttenbrunn () ist ein deutschsprachiges Gymnasium in Arad, Rumänien. Das Lyzeum befindet sich im IV. Bezirk Neu-Arad, der mit Arad durch die Maroschbrücke verbunden ist.

Geschichte 
Deutschsprachigen Unterricht gab es in Neu-Arad bereits 1725, kurz nach der Ansiedlung (1720–1722) von Deutschen im Ort. Schon 1725 unterrichtete der Schulmeister Anton Nick die Kinder der Gemeinde in deutscher Sprache. Im Jahr 1768 erhielt der Oberlehrer Adam Lévay einen Schulgehilfen. Zehn Jahre später, im Schuljahr 1778–1779, wurden 466 Schüler in einem Unterrichtsraum unterrichtet. Das erste Schulgebäude aus Stein wurde 1823 an der Schul-/Kirchengasse errichtet. 1851 erhielt die Schule eine dritte und kurz danach eine vierte Lehrkraft.

Als 1940 das gesamte deutsche Schulwesen der Organisation der Deutschen Volksgruppe in Rumänien untergeordnet wurde, verlegte man das Neu-Arader deutsche Gymnasium nach Arad, wo das Gymnasium Adam Müller-Guttenbrunn entstand. Nach dem Einmarsch der Roten Armee (1944) kam es zum Verbot aller deutschen Schulen in Rumänien. Erst durch die Schulreform von 1948 konnte der deutschsprachige Unterricht wieder aufgenommen werden. Als Neu-Arad, 1945 der Stadt Arad als IV. Bezirk eingegliedert wurde, entstand das Deutsche Lyzeum Arad.

Die Schule hatte seit dem Bestehen des deutschen Unterrichts viele Namen. Seit 1999 trägt sie den Namen Theoretisches Lyzeum Adam Müller-Guttenbrunn, nach dem Heimatdichter, Dramaturgen, Romancier, Begründer und Direktor des Raimund-Theaters in Wien (heute Wiener Staatsoper) Adam Müller-Guttenbrunn, eine der herausragenden Persönlichkeiten des Banats.

Nach der Rumänischen Revolution 1989 stellte die römisch-katholische Kirche in Rumänien Antrag auf Rückerstattung ihrer während der sozialistischen Ära enteigneten Liegenschaften. Bereits 2005 wurden drei der vier Schulgebäude der katholischen Kirche zurückgegeben. Für die nun anfallende Miete der Schule kam die Stadtverwaltung auf. Seit Jahren suchten die Schulleitung und das Demokratische Forum der Deutschen nach Alternativen.

Eines der vier ursprünglichen Gebäude hat das Lyzeum Adam Müller-Guttenbrunn bereits im Sommer 2010 nach Rückerstattung an die Kirche aufgegeben, zwei weitere im Frühjahr 2011. Von den alten Schulgebäuden blieb nur das Gebäude an der Hauptstraße Neu Arads, Calea Timișoarei (vormals Bulevardul Karl Marx) 67 erhalten, wo die Klassen 1 bis 4 untergebracht sind.
Im Sommer 2010 wurden das deutschsprachige Adam-Müller-Guttenbrunn-Lyzeum und die Allgemeinschule Nummer 20 () aus demselben Stadtviertel zusammengeführt. Die beiden Einrichtungen verschmolzen zu einer einzigen Schule, die den Namen des deutschen Lyzeums trägt. Es handelt sich hierbei um eine moralische Wiedergutmachung; die Allgemeinschule Nummer 20 hatte man in den 1970er Jahren von dem deutschen Lyzeum in Neu-Arad abgetrennt und ausschließlich den rumänischen Klassen zur Verfügung gestellt. Nun sind hier die Klassen 5 bis 8 untergebracht.

Die Lyzealschüler der Klassen 9 bis 12 siedelten in zwei Flügel des Forstlyzeums () um. Der Umzug des Theoretischen Lyzeums Adam Müller-Guttenbrunn in die Räumlichkeiten des Forstlyzeums fand anlässlich der Jahresabschlussfeier am 17. Juni 2011 statt. Die Feierlichkeiten wurden in Anwesenheit des Bürgermeisters von Arad, Gheorghe Falcă, des Konsuls der Bundesrepublik Deutschland in Timișoara, Klaus Olazs, und des Vorsitzenden des Demokratischen Forums der Deutschen in Rumänien, Ovidiu Ganț, vollzogen.

Schulaufbau 
Zurzeit hat das Lyzeum Adam Müller-Guttenbrunn 47 Klassen mit den Fachrichtungen Philologie, Mathematik-Informatik und Biologie-Chemie. Die Schulabsolventen können in der zwölften Klasse mehrere Schulabschlüsse erlangen: das österreichische Sprachdiplom, das deutsche Sprachdiplom (DSD, Stufe II) und das Informatikzertifikat. Auch ein bilingualer Abschluss in deutscher Sprache und in rumänischer Sprache ist möglich.

In den drei Gebäuden der Schule gibt es zwei Sportplätze mit Turnhalle, zwei Informatikräume, ein Chemielabor, ein Physiklabor, ein Biologielabor, einen Erdkunderaum, zwei Sprachlabors, einen Multimediaraum. An dem Lyzeum lernen zurzeit insgesamt 1200 Schüler.

Gütersloh, 1874. Druck und Verlag von C. Bertelsmann. Die eur hie? Unſer Programm. (Vom Herausgeber). Kein Hiſtoriograph des 19. Jahrhunderts, er nehme einen Standpunkt ein, welchen er wolle, wird die Miſſion ignoriren können, wenn dem Gemälde, das er von unſrer Zeit entwirft, nicht einer ihrer charakteriſtiſchen Züge fehlen ſoll. Man kann die Miſſion verächtlich behandeln, man kann ihr Feind ſein, aber man kann ſie nicht mehr — ignoriren, denn ſie iſt eine Macht geworden. Und dieſe Macht iſt fie geworden weder durch die Gunſt der öffent⸗ lichen Meinung noch durch den Beiſtand der Staaten, noch durch einen Reich— thum ſonſtiger Hilfsmittel, wie ſie weltlichen Unternehmungen pflegen zu Gebote zu ſtehen, ja vielfach nicht einmal durch die unmittelbare Unterſtützung der Kirche — in kleinen zumeiſt privaten und von der Welt verachteten Kreiſen hat ſie von kleinen Anfängen ihren Ausgang genommen und ihr Werk getrieben mit geringen Mitteln und unſcheinbaren Kräften gleich „einem Senfkorn, das ein Menſch nahm und ſäete es auf ſeinen Acker.“ Und doch iſt dies Senfkorn zum Baume, ja bereits zum großen Baume geworden, unter deſſen Schatten die Vögel des Himmels wohnen und deſſen Zweige ſich immer weiter ausbreiten über „alle Völker der Erde.“ “) Daß dem in Wirklichkeit fo iſt, kann auch von den Gegnern der Miſſion nicht in Abrede geſtellt werden. Wohin immer der Seefahrer, der Kaufmann oder der Entdeckungsreiſende kommt, entweder er findet bereits die Spuren der Miſſionare, oder der Miſſionar folgt bald ſeinen Fußſtapfen. Faſt zu allen uns bekannten und zu⸗ gänglichen Völkern der Erde haben die Boten des Evangeliums ſich Bahn ges brochen und jährlich beſetzen ſie neue Gebiete. In hunderten von Sprachen wird die gute Botſchaft verkündigt und jährlich vermehrt ſich die Zahl der Bibelüber— ſetzungen. Sind wir auch heute noch nicht ſo weit, daß das Evangelium vom Reich „allen Völkern“ und zwar „zu einem Zeugniß über fie” be⸗ reits wirklich gepredigt iſt — ſo ſind wir doch auf dem Wege zu dieſem Ziele der Miſſion, ſind im Ernſt darauf aus den einzigartig großen Befehl Jeſu Chriſti buchſtäblich zu erfüllen: „Gehet hin in alle Welt und machet zu meinen Jüngern alle Völker!“ In diefem Univerſalismus liegt eben das Charakteriſtiſche der jetzigen Miſſionsperiode. Die Kirche Jeſu Chriſti hat ja zu allen Zeiten Miſſion getrieben, aber ſelbſt als dieſe Thätigkeit in ihrer höchſten 2) Es liegt ſchon in dieſer Thatſache eine innere Apologie der Miſſion. 4 Die cur hic? Unſer Programm. Blüthe ſtand: in der apoſtoliſchen und mittelalterlichen Miſſionsperiode hat es eine eigentliche Welt miſſion nicht gegeben. Das Zeugniß von Chriſto zu tra⸗ gen bis an die „Enden der Erden“, ſodaß im eigentlichen Sinne des Worts „alle Völker“ evangeliſirt werden, alſo Weltmiſſion zu treiben — dieſe große Aufgabe zu löſen hat erſt unſre Zeit einen ernſtlichen Anfang gemacht. Es fehlt ja dieſer Zeit nicht an Ereigniſſen und Unternehmungen, die ſie als eine wirklich große charakteriſiren, aber es will uns bedünken, daß ſie alle, wenn auch nicht gerade in den Schatten, ſo doch in den Hintergrund geſtellt werden durch das Rieſenwerk der Pflanzung des Reiches Gottes durch die ganze Welt! Beſonders angeſichts dieſes Unternehmens iſt es Wahrheit, daß wir in einer großen Zeit leben, auf die man in der That das Wort anwenden darf: „ſelig ſind die Augen, die da ſehen, was ihr ſehet, denn Ich ſage euch: viele Propheten und Könige wollten ſehen, was ihr ſehet und haben es nicht geſehen und hören, was ihr höret und haben es nicht ehöret.“ 5 Aber es gehet heute vielen Chriſten wie zur Zeit Jeſu vielen Juden: „ſie haben Augen und ſehen nicht und Ohren und hören nicht.“ Allerdings conſta⸗ tiren wir gern, daß die Zahl der Miſſionsfreunde ſeit dem Beginne der modernen Miſſionsperiode in erfreulicher Weiſe gewachſen und daß ein Miſſionsgeiſt in der evangeliſchen Kirche erwacht iſt, wie er kaum in einer andern Zeit ihrer Geſchichte vorhanden geweſen — aber ebenſowenig läßt ſich leugnen, daß weite Kreiſe, namentlich unter den höheren Geſellſchaftsklaſſen und leider nicht blos unter den kirchlich Indifferenten für die Sache der Miſſion weder Sinn noch Herz haben. Man ſollte denken, daß ſchon die einzigartige Großartigkeit dieſes im vollen Sinne des Worts univerſalen Unternehmens ſie begeiſtern und der bedeutende Einfluß, den es auf die Civiliſation der Heidenvölker wie auf die Erweiterung unſrer geographiſchen, anthropologiſchen, ethnologiſchen, religionsgeſchichtlichen und linguiſtiſchen Kenntniſſe übt, ihr Intereſſe erwecken müßte! Zwar wird in nicht wenigen wiſſenſchaftlichen wie populären Zeitſchriften, in Tagesblättern, in der⸗ Reiſeliteratur ꝛc. der Miſſion nicht ſelten gedacht, aber — mit wenigen Aus⸗ nahmen — in einer ſehr einſeitigen, polemiſchen, oft verächtlichen ja gehäſſigen Weiſe, ſodaß dieſe Erwähnung viel mehr Antipathie als Sympathie zu erwecken geeignet iſt. Und doch hat die Miſſion freilich nicht blos wegen ihrer Großartigkeit, ihres culturgeſchichtlichen Einfluſſes und der mannigfaltigen Handreichung, die ſie der Wiſſenſchaft leiſtet, ſondern vornämlich um der geiſtlichen Segnungen willen, die ſie den Heidenvölkern bringt, den gerechteſten Anſpruch auf die Sympathie auch der gebildetſten Kreiſe! Solche Sympathie zu wecken iſt nun ein Theil der Aufgabe, welche ſich die „Allgemeine Miſſions-Zeit⸗ ſchrift“ geſteckt hat. Sie will den Verſuch wagen auch da ein Verſtändniß für die Miſſion zu Stande zu bringen und dahin Kunde von ihr zu tragen, wo aus Vorurtheil und Mangel an Kenntniß Indifferentismus gegen ſie herrſcht, will den Aufrichtigen unter ihren Gegnern Gelegenheit zur Prüfung und den Zweiflern Material zur Bildung eines günſtigen Urtheils liefern. Bei dem allem wird ſie ſich — zwar nicht jener neutralen Objectivität, die kühl iſt und kühl macht bis ans Herz hinan — wohl Die cur hic? Unſer Programm. 5 5 aber der gewiſſenhafteſten geſchichtlichen Treue und der größtmöglichſten Nüchtern⸗ heit befleißigen, ſich jeder Art der Schönfärberei enthalten, auch die Fehler nach beſten Kräften zu vermeiden ſuchen, durch welche hier und da eine kleinliche, ſentimental erbauliche und unkritiſche Berichterſtattung den Geſchmack an der Mif- ſion verleidet hat. ö Die neue Zeitſchrift will aber ſelbſtverſtändlich auch denen dienen, die be⸗ reits Freunde der Miſſion ſind, und zwar vornämlich ſolchen, die auch in der Miſſion gern mehr als Kirchthurmpolitik treiben, etwas Ganzes von der Ausbreitung des Reiches Gottes zu wiſſen verlangen und ſowohl für miſſions⸗ techniſche wie cultur⸗ und religionsgeſchichtliche, geographiſche, ethnologiſche und ähnliche Fragen, ſoweit ſie mit der Evangeliſation der Völker im Zuſammenhange ſtehen, ein Intereſſe haben. Da möglichſt gründliche Bekanntſchaft mit der Miſſionsgeſchichte nicht blos die Unterlage für ein richtiges Urtheil über die Miſſion ſondern auch eine weſentliche Vorausſetzung für die Liebe zu und die Mitarbeit an ihr bildet, ſo wird ein hiſtoriſcher Theil den erſten ja den Hauptinhalt der Zeitſchrift ausmachen. Dieſer miſſions-geſchichtliche Theil ſoll aber, da der Titel eine „Allgemeine Miſſions-Zeitſchrift“ ankündigt, wie das ganze Miſſions gebiet fo auch die ganze Miſſions zeit umfaſſen, wenngleich die Miſſionsgebiete der evangeliſchen Kirche unter den Heiden und die Miſſionsarbeit der neueren Zeit ſpecielle Berückſichtigung finden werden. Wir ſind durchaus keine abſoluten Gegner jedes Partikularismus in der Miſſion. Wie kein unbefangener Hiſtoriker neben der politiſchen Schwä⸗ chung, die er gebracht und dem kleinſtaatlichen Sinne, den er gepflegt den man⸗ nigfachen Segen in Abrede ſtellen wird, der dem deutſchen Vaterlande durch ſeinen ſtaatlichen Partikularismus ſeiner Zeit zu Theil geworden, ſo iſt es auch der Miffion zu Gute gekommen, daß an den verſchiedenſten Punkten die ver- ſchiedenſten Miſſions-Geſellſchaften entſtanden, und ebenſoviele Heerde des Mif- ſionslebens in der Heimath wurden und iſt es bis auf dieſen Tag der Sache durchaus förderlich, daß diejenigen Kreiſe, welche die heimathliche Miſſionsgemeinde einer beſtimmten Geſellſchaft bilden, auch um die Geſchichte dieſer Geſellſchaft ſich ganz ſpeciell bekümmern.!) Aber dieſer Partikularismus hat in der Miſſion wie auf dem Gebiete des ſtaatlichen Lebens ſein Maß und ſeine Zeit. Je länger je ſehnlicher wird der Wunſch nach einer einheitlicheren Geſtaltung der proteſtantlichen Miſſionsarbeit auf den verſchiedenen Gebieten der Heidenwelt und je länger je dringender das Bedürfniß nach einer einheitlicheren, zuſammenfaſſen— deren und überſichtlicheren Darſtellung dieſer Arbeit für Freund ) Die „Allgemeine Miſſions⸗Zeitſchrift“ iſt alſo weit davon entfernt, den ſpe ei ellen Miſſionsblättern der einzelnen Geſellſchaften Concurrenz zu machen. Sie will vielmehr eine Alliance mit ihnen ſchließen und den einzelnen Ge- ſellſchaften direet und indirect dienen, dire ot indem fie abgerundete Bilder auch aus ihrer Arbeit liefert, indirect indem ſie durch Orientirung auf dem Geſammtmiſſions⸗ gebiete das Verſtändniß für und das Bedürfniß nach den Specialitäten der einzelnen Geſellſchaften weckt und fördert — wie ſie denn wiederum auch zuverſichtlich auf Un— terſtützung ihrer Tendenz ſeitens dieſer Geſellſchaften glaubt rechnen zu dürfen. 6 Dic cur hie? Unſer Programm. und Feind in der Heimath. Die „Allgemeine Miſſions⸗Zeitſchrift“ möchte in Verbindung mit den Miſſionszeitſchriften von ähnlicher Tendenz („Evangel. Miſſions⸗Magazin“ und „Miſſionsnachrichten der Oſtindiſchen Miſſionsanſtalt zu Halle“) an ihrem Theile und nach ihrer Auffaſſung dieſes Bedürfniß befriedigen. Sie wird deshalb zunächſt jährlich eine möglichſt zuverläſſige und umfaſ⸗ ſende Rundſchau über das geſammte Miſſionsgebiet bringen und dadurch den von der Bremer Allgemeinen Miſſions-Conferenz ſchon vor Jahren gehegten Wunſch nach einer jährlich erſcheinenden Miſſions-Chronik realiſi⸗ ren. Bei den zahlreichen Schwierigkeiten, die ſich, wie den Fachleuten am beſten bekannt, der Ausführung dieſes Unternehmens entgegenſtellen und die nur im Laufe mehrerer Jahre und durch die vereinte reſp. getheilte Arbeit Mehrerer relativ überwunden werden können, dürfen wir wohl auf die Nachſicht der Leſer rechnen, wenn ihnen nicht ſofort eine völlig lückenloſe und bis in's Detail exacte Ueberſicht geboten werden ſollte. Neben dieſer Rundſchau ſtellen wir es uns aber auch zur Aufgabe in einzelnen geſchichtlichen Aufſätzen uns über das geſammte Miſſionsge⸗ biet zu verbreiten. Es ſoll alſo nicht blos die geſammte Miſſionsthätigkeit unter den Heiden zur Darſtellung kommen, ſondern auch die unter den Mu— hamedanern und Juden Berückſichtigung finden und zwar nicht allein — wenn auch vorzüglich — die der e vangeliſchen, ſondern möglichſt auch die der römiſch und griechiſch-katholiſchen Kirche. Selbſtverſtändlich kann dabei nicht die Abſicht ſein in jedem Jahre von allem etwas zu bringen, ſondern im Laufe der Jahre Bauſteine zu ſammeln, die in ihrer Zuſammenſetzung etwas Ganzes geben vom Reiche Gottes und ſeiner Ausbreitung in der Welt. Aehnlich iſt es zu verſtehen, wenn wir die geſammte Miſſionszeit, alſo neben der modernen Miſſionsperiode auch die älteren in den Kreis unſrer Darſtellung zu ziehen beabſichtigen. Die Miſſion iſt eben nichts Neues in unſrer Zeit, ſie wird geübt ſo lange es eine chriſtliche Kirche giebt und wo immer dieſe Kirche zu Stande gekommen, da iſt es durch die Miſſion geſchehen. Es iſt daher zunächſt ebenſo eine Pflicht der Dankbarkeit, die wir abtragen, wie ein apologetiſches Intereſſe, dem wir dienen, wenn wir der älteren Miſſionsgeſchichte gedenken. Dieſes Gedächtniß iſt aber auch für die Miſſions⸗ theorie wie -praxis unſrer Tage von Wichtigkeit. So ſehr eine Verglei⸗ chung von Sonſt und Jetzt auch einen Fortſchritt in der heutigen Methode conſtatiren wird — es wird ſich auch von den Alten noch Manches lernen laſſen, ſintemalen ſie auch nicht ohne Weisheit und den Geiſt Gottes geweſen ſind! Was die Form dieſer geſchichtlichen Aufſätze betrifft, fo ſollen fie nicht aphoriſtiſche Mittheilungen, ſondern ſtets etwas in ſich Ganzes und Abge— rundetes ſein, gleichviel ob ein Specialbild gezeichnet oder eine generellere Monographie geliefert wird. So großen Werth wir auch auf die Decailſchilde⸗ rung legen und um der Anſchaulichkeit willen am rechten Orte ihr ihren Platz einräumen werden, fo wollen wir doch jene minutiöſe Berichterſtattung mög⸗ licht vermeiden, die ſich ins Kleinliche verliert, den Geſichtskreis einengt und vor lauter Bäumen den Wald nicht ſehen läßt. Bezüglich der Charak⸗ teriſirung des chriſtlichen Lebens ſoll die keuſcheſte Nüchternheit uns Dic cur hie? Unſer Programm. 7 leiten und über der Freude von der Kraft des Evangelii geſunde Beweiſe an⸗ führen zu können die ſtrengſte Kritik nicht vergeſſen und auch der Schatten nicht überſehen werden, der wie jedem Menſchenhänden anvertrauten Werke ſo auch der Miſſion anklebt. So wenig aber die Miſſion mit einem Heiligenſchein um das Haupt ſoll abgemalt werden, ebenſowenig werden wir natürlich es unterlaſſen durch eine rechte Beleuchtung unverſtändiger übler Nachrede vorzu⸗ beugen. i Der miſſionsgeſchichtliche Theil unſrer Zeitſchrift darf aber auch die Heimath nicht übergehen. Das Miſſionsleben in der heimathlichen Kirche ſelbſt, hat ja ebenſo ſeine Geſchichte wie die Miſſionsarbeit unter den nichtchriſtlichen Völkern. Hier ſind die Wurzeln des Baumes, deſſen Zweige die Heidenwelt zu überſchatten die Verheißung haben. Es iſt unumgänglich nöthig ſowohl in allgemeinen Ueberſichten als in ſpeciellen Geſchichtsbildern eine zuverläſſige und umfaſſende Kunde davon zu geben, wie weit die Chriſtenheit ihrer Miſſionspflicht genügt, wie viel und was für Arbeiter ſie ſtellt und welche Mittel ſie liefert, wieweit die Kirche als ſolche Miſſion treibt, wie viele Miſſions⸗ Geſellſchaften es giebt, was dieſelben leiſten und welche Grundſätze ſie leiten ꝛc. Unſre Zeitſchrift will ſolche Kunde bringen nicht blos in allgemeinen Ueberſichten, auch nicht blos in einzelnen Monographien der bedeu— tendſten Miſſions-Geſellſchaften und in Biographien der Bahn brechen den Miſſions-Inſpectoren, ſondern auch in ſolchen Bildern, welche die Entſtehung und das Wachsthum des Miſſionslebens an verſchiedenen Orten und zu verſchiedenen Zeiten darſtellen. Auch mit geſchicht— lichen Mittheilungen dieſer Art glauben wir zugleich eine apologetiſche Pflicht zu erfüllen, da ſie ebenſo den Beweis liefern, daß die Miſſion nicht eine Win⸗ kelſache iſt, ſondern über die ganze chriſtliche Welt hin ein großes Heer in ihrem Dienſte hat, wie daß die Heimath, von der ſie ausgeht, reichen Segen von ihr zurückempfängt. Aber auf Miſſionsgeſchichte ſoll ſich die neue Zeitſchrift nicht beſchränken. Nicht blos um die Schwierigkeiten zu begreifen, mit denen die Miſſionsarbeit zu kämpfen hat, ſondern vornämlich um die richtigen Unterlagen zu gewinnen, auf die ſie ſich je nach der Individualität der verſchiedenen Völker ſtellen muß und um den Nachweis zu führen nach wie vielen Seiten hin ſie den mannigfaltigſten Wiſſenſchaften dient und von ihnen ſich dienen läßt — iſt eine möglichſt genaue Kunde von Land und Leuten unerläßlich. Die „Allgemeine Miſſions-Zeit⸗ ſchrift“ muß daher nothwendig geographiſche, linguiſtiſche, anthropo— logiſche, ethnologiſche, culturgeſchichtliche und beſonders religions— geſchichtliche Fragen, ſoweit fie in einer Beziehung zur Miſſion ſtehen, in den Kreis ihrer Betrachtung ziehen. Alle die genannten Gebiete ſind Hilfswiſ⸗ ſenſchaften für die Miſſion, wie wiederum die Miſſion ihnen eine weſentliche Hilfe leiſtet, ſowenig Dank fie auch oft dafür erntet. So hat die Miſſion bei⸗ ſpielsweiſe das größte Intereſſe an allen Entdeckungsreiſen, durch welche unbekannte Länder uns bekannt gemacht und verſchloſſene etwa erſchloſſen werden, wie umgekehrt die Erweiterung unſrer geographiſchen Kenntniſſe vielfach Miſſio⸗ naren zu danken iſt, wofür zum Beweiſe man nur an Dr. Livingſtone zu erin⸗ nern braucht. Wir verweiſen weiter guf die Bedeutung, welche die Ethnologie 8 Die eur hic? Unſer Program. für die Miſſion und die Miſſion für die Ethnologie hat. Wie der einzelne Menſch als ein ſpecielles Individuum es als ſein Recht beanſpruchen kann nach ſeiner Individualität behandelt zu werden und der allgemein für einen ſchlechten Pädagogen gilt, der aus dieſem Rechte für ſich keine Pflicht macht — alſo iſt es auch bezüglich der Völker. Auch die Völker beſitzen ihre Indivi— dualität und die Miſſion ſoll ſie pädagogiſch behandeln. Es dürfen nicht alle Völker nach einer Schablone evangeliſirt werden, wie man auch aus der Miſſionspraxis des großen „Apoſtels der Heiden“ ſattſam erkennen kann, der je nach der Individualität der verſchiedenen Völkerſchaften meiſterlich verſteht „ſeine Stimme zu wandeln“ und „allen alles zu werden.“ Nichts iſt für die Miſſionspraxis wichtiger als genaue Kenntniß des Charakters, der Sitte, der Cultur⸗ und Religionsſtufe der verſchiedenen Völkerſchaften um in pädagogi- ſcher Weisheit das rechte Thürlein zu finden und zu öffnen, durch welches das Evangelium dem Herzen des Volkes nahe gebracht werden kann und es will uns bedünken, daß in dieſem Stück unſre heutige Miſſion noch viel zu lernen hat! Um ſo unentbehrlicher alſo die Ethnologie! Von welcher Seite auch die Belehrung komme, die Miſſion nehme ſie dankbar an. Aber die Vertreter der ethnologiſchen Wiſſenſchaft mögen auch der Miſſion den Ruhm laſſen, der ihr gebührt und frei öffentlich bekennen, wie viel werthvolles Material ſie ihr verdanken und endlich einmal aufhören die Männer verächtlich zu behandeln, mit deren Federn ſie ſich doch ſo oft ſchmücken! Sollen wir noch der Linguiſtik mit einigen Worten gedenken? Es iſt Grundſatz der evangeliſchen Miſſion jedem Volke in ſeiner Mutterſprache das Heil in Chriſto zu verkünden. Der Miſſionar wenn er die fremde Sprache lernt wird ja gern ein Schüler der Männer der Wiſſenſchaft, die dieſelbe etwa vor ihm bearbeitet haben. Derſelbe Miſſionar lehrt aber auch nicht ſelten die Sprache, die er ſelbſt erſt gelernt hat — und bereichert die Wiſſenſchaft der Linguiſtik. Und mehr als das. Er ſchafft eine Schriftſprache und legt den Grund zu einer Nationalliteratur. Man braucht nur an die c. 230 Bibel⸗ überſetzungen zu erinnern — welch eine Bedeutung haben dieſe für die Linguiſtik, für das Culturleben, für die Geſchichte der Bildung des menſchlichen Geiſtes und Herzens! Doch genug, der Leſer verſteht, was wir im Sinne haben. Schon in den bisherigen Ausführungen iſt gelegentlich mehrfach des apo— logetiſchen Dienſtes gedacht, welchen die „Allg. Miſſions-⸗Zeitſchrift“ der Miſſion leiſten möchte. Dieſer Geſichtspunkt iſt indeß ſo wichtig, daß wir ihm einen ſelbſtändigen Platz in unſerm Programm anweiſen müſſen. Gott ſei Dank! man ignorirt die Miſſion nicht mehr, man greift fie an! In Zeit⸗ ſchriften der mannigfaltigſten Tendenz, in Reiſebeſchreibungen, Romanen, ja in ſpeciell zu dieſem Zwecke geſchriebenen polemiſchen Schriften wird ſie nicht blos, einer ſcharfen, ſondern meiſt einer ſehr ungerechten und — unverſtändigen Kritik Dic eur hie? Unſer Programm. 9 unterworfen und aufs feindlichſte behandelt. So ſehr wir auch in dieſen Arne griffen einen Beweis von der zunehmenden Macht der Miſſi ion ſehen dürfen, ſo iſt ihnen gegenüber eine Vertheidigung doch ebenſo ein Bedürfniß wie eine Pflicht. Und zwar denken wir nicht blos an eine generelle Apologetik. Es wird ja beſonders den Vorurtheilen der öffentlichen Meinung gegen über ganz unerläßlich fein, auch dieſe zu pflegen — allein ſpecielle Angriffe er— fordern eine ſpecielle Apologie und je mehr dieſelbe auf gründlicher Kenntniß der in Rede ſtehenden Verhältniſſe beruht, deſto durchſchlagender wird ſie ſein. Unfruchtbarer Polemik wollen wir dabei ſo weit es irgend angeht, aus dem Wege gehen und auch jede Specialapologie fo poſitiv als möglich führen. End- lich ſollen auch Miſſionsgedanken aus und nach der Schrift ſowohl unter dem apologetiſchen als unter dem miſſionstheoretiſchen Geſichtspunkte ein Räumlein finden. Es ſcheint uns nämlich ein Bedürfniß, daß auch miſſionstheoretiſche reſp. ⸗praktiſche Fragen in einem Allgemeinen Miſſions-Organe zur öffentlichen Beſprechung gebracht werden, nicht blos um nach dem Maß unſrer Erkenntniß und Kraft der Arbeit unter den Heiden ſelbſt hier und da einen kleinen Dienſt zu leiſten, ſondern auch um in der Heimath ein größeres Verſtändniß für die hohen Aufgaben der Miſſion wie für die großen Schwierigkeiten, mit denen fie zu kämpfen hat, herbeiführen zu helfen. Auch die Miſſion hat ihre Theorie und bedarf je mehr ſie aus den Kinderſchuhen herauswächſt und an Umfang zunimmt deſto mehr einer wiſſenſchaftlichen Unterlage für ihre praktiſche Thätigkeit und zwar in vil höherem Grade als dies mit der Führung des paſtoralen Amtes der Fall iſt. Es giebt hier eine Reihe Fragen von der weittragendſten Bedeu- tung über die Aufgabe der heutigen Miſſion, ihre Methode, die Vorbildung zu ihrem Dienſte, die Heranbildung eines elngehornen Lehrerſtandes, die Erziehung der heidenchriſtlichen Gemeinden zur Selbſtthätigkeit und Selbſtſtändigkeit, die Behandlung der Polygamie, Kaſte, Sklaverei ꝛc. Selbſt wenn die Beantwortung dieſer Fragen nur für die eigentlichen Fachleute Werth hätte, müßte es wünſchenswerth ſein ein Organ zu beſitzen, in welchem ſie zur Discuſſion geſtellt würden, da ſie aber zugleich von ſehr allgemeinem Intereſſe wenigſtens für die Gebildeteren unter den Miſſionsfreunden und durchaus dazu angethan find, die Theilnahme für die Miſſion zu fördern, fo hoffen wir mit ihrer Auf⸗ nahme in unſer Programm um ſo mehr auf Billigung rechnen zu dürfen. Da unſre Zeitſchrift aber auch für die Heimath eine praktiſche Tendenz hat, ſo wird ſie ſich auch ſolchen Fragen nicht entziehen, auf welche Weiſe das Intereſſe für, die Liebe zu, und die thätige Mitarbeit an der Miſſion geweckt und gefördert werden kann, wird alſo z. B. über Organiſation von Miſſionsvereinen, Feier von Miſſionsfeſten, Einrichtung von Miſſionsconferenzen, Abhaltung von Miſſionsſtunden, Sammlung von Miſſionsbeiträgen, Verbreitung von Miſſionsſchriften ꝛc. Aufſätze bringen. Auch für die Miſſionsliteratur und zwar nicht für die deutſche allein, wenn auch für ſie vornämlich ſoll ein Platz reſervirt werden. Wir gedenken alle wichtigen Erſcheinungen auf dieſem Gebiete theils in überſichtlichen Gruppen 10 Die cur hic? Unſer Programm. theils in Einzelanzeigen zur Kenntniß unſrer Leſer zu bringen, auch durch die ein⸗ zelnen Miſſionsblätter und die Miſſionstractate je und dann einen Gang zu thun. Endlich ſoll die Zeitſchrift anhangsweiſe auch eine Zeitung enthalten, die theils in Original⸗Correſpondenzen, theils in Mittheilungen, welche Miſſions⸗ und andern Blättern entnommen ſind, eine möglichſt allſeitige Kunde von den wichtigſten neuſten Ereigniſſen auf dem großen Miſſionsfelde bringt. Dies unſer Programm. Wir denken es iſt die beſte Apologie unſres Unternehmens und überhebt uns der Nothwendigkeit einer weiteren Begründung deſſelben auch gegenüber der Exiſtenz von Miſſionsblättern von allgemeiner Ten⸗ denz. Freilich — es iſt leichter Programme aufſtellen als ſie durchführen! Wir ſind uns der Schwierigkeit des beabſichtigten Unternehmens durchaus bewußt und ſcheuen uns nicht zu bekennen, daß wir im vollen Gefühle unſrer Schwachheit an daſſelbe herangetreten ſind. Aber wir vertrauen auf die Durchhilfe des HErrn, der feinen Jüngern befohlen hat: „handelt bis daß ich wiederkomme“ und der da will, daß ſeiner heiligen Reichsſache gedient werde auf mancherlei Weiſe, ſonderlich in einer Zeit, in welcher der immer lauter werdende Ruf: „wir wollen nicht, daß dieſer über uns herrſche“, auch viele von ſolchen völlig ab- wendig zu machen droht, die „nicht ferne ſind vom Reiche Gottes“. Wir appelliren auch, beſonders für die erſte Zeit, an die freundliche Nachſicht unfrer Leſer. Ermöglichen fie uns das wirktliche Zuſtandekommen der Zeitſchrift, fo hoffen wir mit dem Fortgange derſelben immer mehr in die Arbeit zu wach⸗ ſen und tüchtigere Leiſtungen zu liefern. Es iſt wahr: das Programm iſt reich beſetzt — allein wir glaubten, daß in einer „Allgemeinen Miſſionszeit⸗ ſchrift“ keiner der genannten Punkte fehlen dürfte, auch gedachten wir des bekann⸗ ten Wortes: „wer vieles bringt, wird manchem etwas bringen.“ Eine Anzahl auf dem Miſſionsgebiete heimiſcher Männer hat ihre Mit⸗ arbeit bereits zugeſagt; vielleicht thut die Probenummer noch hier und da einen Werbedienſt, daß noch manch einer ſich mit uns verbindet, in deſſen Hände die erſte „Einladung zur Mitarbeit“ nicht gelangt iſt. Die „Allgemeine Miſſions⸗Zeitſchrift“ ſoll in Monatsheften von 2½ event. 3 enggedruckten Bogen erſcheinen und der jährliche Abonne— mentspreis nur 2 Thlr betragen. Je und dann wird eine Karte reſp. ein Bild beigegeben werden. Der HErr der Miſſion aber, dem zur Verherrlichung Seines Namens, zum Bau Seines Reiches und zur Erfüllung Seines Willens auch dieſe Zeit- ſchrift ernſtlich dienen will und ohne den wir nichts können, auch nichts können wollen — der ſegne und fördre das Werk unſrer Hände, damit die Liebe zur Miſſion und die energiſche Arbeit an ihr wachſe und ſich mehre auch unter unſerm deutſchen Volke, dem Er in den letzten Jahren einen ſo hervorragenden Platz angewieſen und damit eine ſo große Aufgabe auch für die Ausbreitung Seines Reiches geſtellt hat unter den Völkern der Erde! 11 Orientirende Ueberſicht über den gegenwärtigen Stand des geſammten chriſtlichen Miffions-Werkes von R. Grundemann. Einleitende Bemerkungen. Schon ſeit der erſten Bremer Miſſions-Conferenz iſt von mir eine jähr⸗ liche Miſſions⸗Chronik erwartet worden. So gern ich auch bereit war, der ſchwierigen Arbeit, die eine ſolche erheiſcht, mich zu unterziehen, bin ich doch ſelbſt trotz der Bereitwilligkeit der meiſten deutſchen Miſſionsgeſellſchaften zur Unter- ſtützung des Unternehmens, bisher nicht im Stande geweſen die äußeren Schwie— rigkeiten, die die Veröffentlichung darbot, zu überwinden. Die „Allgemeine Miſ— ſions⸗Zeitſchrift“ verſpricht einen angemeſſenen Ort zu bieten, an welchem die beabſichtigte Chronik, wenn auch vielleicht in etwas veränderter Form, zur Aus— führung gelangen kann. Ich hoffe, daß ſie den Leſern willkommen ſein wird. Sie ſoll ja den Miſſionsfreund, der die fortſchreitende Entwicklung der Ausbrei— tung des Reiches Gottes unter den Heiden verfolgen möchte, in den Stand ſe— Gen, dies zu thun ohne die Mühe, die Quellen ſelbſt nachzuleſen. — Die um⸗ faſſenden Arbeiten auf dieſem Gebiete, zu denen mir mein Miſſions-Atlas Ge— legenheit gegeben, ſcheinen eine angemeſſene Grundlage zu bieten, an die ſich eine jährliche Rundſchau über das geſammte Miffionsfeld paſſend anſchließen möchte. Ich muß jedoch geſtehen, daß mit den inzwiſchen verſtrichenen Jahren auch die Reſultate jener Arbeiten bei mir bereits etwas verblaßt ſind. Ich kann daher den Leſer, der mich zum Führer nehmen will, vor der Hand nur einladen, zu— nächſt einen Gang zur allgemeinen Orientirung zu machen. Ein jeder folgender Rundgang, der ſich in den beſtimmten Gränzen eines Jahres zu bewegen hat, wird ein konkreteres, anſchaulicheres und deutlicheres Bild liefern. In dieſer Be— ziehung wird der vorliegende Anfang auch aus andern Gründen manches zu wünſchen übrig laſſen. Selbſt eine Verarbeitung der ſämmtlichen in die Oeffent— lichkeit tretenden Berichte über das eine oder das andre Miſſionsfeld würde zu— weilen nicht im Stande ſein ein derartiges Bild zu geben. Es war ſchon lange mein Wunſch, (dem aber für jetzt noch nicht entſprochen werden konnte) dieſem Mangel durch direkte Anfragen bei betreffenden Miſſionaren zu begegnen. Sollte der Herr auf dieſe Arbeit ſeinen Segen legen, ſo hoffe ich mit der Zeit auf dem angedeuteten Wege vielfach ein klareres und deutlicheres Bild von manchen Miſſionsgebieten geben zu können. Ich möchte ſagen: die Tragweite des Fern- rohrs, deſſen ich mich jetzt noch bedienen muß, reicht für manche derſelben nicht zu und läßt nur allgemeine, zerfließende Umriſſe erkennen. Vielleicht aber ge— lingt es mir mit der Zeit ſchärfere Inſtrumente anzuwenden. — Ebenſo wünſchte ich den rechten Standpunkt, von dem aus ein jeder Theil des großen Miffions- werks richtig zu betrachten iſt, recht deutlich angeben zu können. Derſelbe hängt ab von den verſchiedenen, meiſt durch denominationale Verſchiedenheiten be— dingte Auffaſſungen der Miſſion und der bei derſelben angewandten Praxis. Auch 12 Orientirende Ueberſicht. in dieſer Hinſicht werde ich bemüht ſein, immer beſtimmtere Angaben zu machen, durch die der Miſſionsfreund, der vielleicht nur allzuſehr hierin zu generaliſiren gewohnt iſt, und alle Miſſionen mit einem und demſelben Maße zu meſſen pflegt, vor den daraus unvermeidlich ſich ergebenden Irrthümern geſchützt werde. Eine beſondere Beigabe zu der beabſichtigten Miſſions-Chronik ſollten ſta⸗ tiſtiſche Ueberſichten bilden. Jedoch je länger ich mich mit dieſem Punkt beſchäf⸗ tigte, deſto mehr lernte ich die Schwierigkeiten deſſelben erkennen. Dieſe beſtehen nicht blos darin, daß es ſchwer hält, die annähernd für den gegenwärtigen Stand geltenden Zahlen von allen Miſſionsgebieten gleichmäßig zu erhalten, ſondern noch vielmehr in den verſchiedenen Principien, die der Zählung in den verſchiedenen Miſſionen zu Grunde gelegt werden. Beſonders iſt dies der Fall in Bezug auf die Zahl der Bekehrten. Es giebt keinen Generalnenner in welchen die Bekehr⸗ ten der Methodiſten und der Ausbreitungs-Geſellſchaft (S. P. G.), der Inde⸗ pendenten und unſrer deutſchen Miſſionen, wenn wir ſie durch Zahlenbrüche dar⸗ ſtellen wollten, zutreffenderweiſe aufgehen würden. Damit verbietet ſich das Sum⸗ miren von ſelbſt. Nur wenn es gelänge in jedem Falle dem Leſer das Zählungs⸗ princip mit der Zahl zugleich in prägnanter Weiſe zur Anſchauung zu bringen, würde eine Zuſammenſtellung der betreffenden Angaben von Werth ſein. Unter dieſen Erwägungen verzichte ich denn vor der Hand darauf, ſtatiſtiſche Ueberſich⸗ ten zu geben und beſchränke mich auf einzelne Zahlenangaben, die hier und dort zur Charakteriſtik eines Miſſionsgebietes dienen mögen. — Sollte es ſpäter mög⸗ lich werden von denſelben directe Mittheilungen einzuziehen, ſo wird ſich auch in dieſem Punkte den Miſſionsfreunden mehr darbieten laſſen. Man ſehe alſo dieſe orientirende Ueberſicht als einen erſten Verſuch an, deſſen ſchwache Seiten ich nicht verhehlen will. Sollte ſie ſich trotzdem des Bei— falls der deutſchen Miſſionskreiſe erfreuen, ſo wird mir dies eine Ermuthigung ſein, ſo Gott will, mit wachſenden Kräften mich für den nächſten Rundgang zu rüſten. I. Weſtafrika. 1. Senegambien. )) 1) Die erſte Miſſion, die wir von Norden kommend an der weſtafrikani⸗ ſchen Küſte antreffen, iſt die der Pariſer Société des Missions éEvangeli- ques, ?) die früher ſüdlicher in Sedhiu am Cafamance ihre Station hatte. Seit 1870 iſt St. Louis der Sitz der Miſſion und jener Ort wird nur noch als Außenſtation zu Zeiten beſucht. Die genannte franzöſiſche Kolonie bot für die damals auszuſendenden neuen Miſſionare an den Evangeliſchen, die ſich unter ihren 15,000 Einwohnern finden, Anknüpfungspunkte. Die heidniſchen reſp. muhamedaniſchen Wolofs wurden erſt nach und nach zugänglicher. Die Miffto- nare eigneten ſich die Sprache derſelben an und konnten bereits namhafte Ueber⸗ 1) Vgl. meinen Miſſions-Atlas I, 1 u. 2. 2) Die verſchiedenen Miſſionsgeſellſchaften ſetze ich hier als bekannt voraus.

Orientirende Ueberſicht. 13 ſetzungen in dieſelbe ausführen. Die neuſten Berichte melden eine Anzahl von Bekehrungen, unter denen einige recht erbaulich ſind. 2) Die katholiſche Miſſion des apoſtoliſchen Vicariats Senegambien hat ihren Hauptpunkt in St. Joſeph de N'gazobil, an den ſich verſchiedene andre Stationen anlehnen. Die Wirkſamkeit derſelben ſcheint ſich vorzugsweiſe auf er⸗ ziehende Thätigkeit zu erſtrecken. Die Heranbildung eines Clerus aus den Ein⸗ gebornen ift beſonders in's Auge gefaßt. Ausgedehnte Anſtalten haben die wei- tere Aufgabe mit der Anleitung zum Ackerbau und verſchiedenen Handwerken der Bevölkerung eine mit den katholiſchen Formen verbundene Kultur zuzuführen. Für die Bildung der weiblichen Jugend ſind zahlreiche Ordensſchweſtern thätig. Die Stationen haben 1869 ſchwer durch die Cholera, gelitten. 3) Die Miſſion am Gambia. Hier hat ſich das dem Europäer ge— fährliche Klima Weſtafrikas beſonders verderblich gezeigt. Infolge davon haben die Methodiſten ſchon lange ihre in früheren Jahren durch ausgedehnte Er— weckungen zu einer Blüthe gelangten Gemeinden der Arbeit eingeborner Prediger überlaſſen müſſen, die nur unter der Oberleitung eines europäiſchen Miſſionars ſtehen. Verdient der dadurch hervorgerufene Umſtand, daß jetzt das Evangelium vorzugsweiſe in den Volksſprachen reſp. Dialekten verkündigt wird, (während ſonſt das von den Küſtenbewohnern, wenn auch verderbt geſprochene, doch leidlich ver— ſtandene Engliſch benutzt wurde) alle Beachtung, ſo läßt ſich ſelbſt von den beſ— ſeren jener Arbeiter bei weitem nicht die Leiſtung eines Europäers erwarten. Die Gemeinden find noch nicht auf-dem Standpunkte, daß aus ihnen ſelbſt die Organe ihrer Leitung hervorgehen könnten. Es fehlen die für dieſen Zweck er— forderlichen Schulen. Oft ſcheinen die Männer, denen man ein Amt übertragen muß, demſelben nicht gewachſen zu fein, wenn fie nicht vielleicht gar durch An— ſtoß mancherlei Art die Sache des Chriſtenthums ſchädigen. Insbeſondere leidet die Gemeinde auf der entfernten Mac Carthy Inſel, die nur ſelten von einem europäiſchen Miſſionare beſucht werden kann, unter dieſen Verhältniſſen. Das dortige Miſſionswerk kränkelt überhaupt, ſeitdem die brittiſche Beſatzung von jener Inſel zurück gezogen iſt (1867). Es iſt nicht möglich die Gemeinde in ihrem Beſtande zu erhalten, geſchweige ſie zu erweitern. — Im Laufe des verfloſſenen Jahres iſt nun auch die Beſatzung von Bathurſt weggenommen (1872) und damit die Lage der ganzen Miſſion erſchwert. Die verſchiedenen Stämme, die zum Theil ſtreng, zum Theil lax muhamedaniſch!) zum Theil heidniſch find, ha⸗ ben ſeitdem unaufhörliche Kriege. Der Ackerbau wird vernachläſſigt, und in Folge davon ſtockt der Handel (die Erdnuß bildet einen bedeutenden Export⸗ Artikel). Auch werden die Eingebornen gegen die Weißen immer frecher und erlauben ſich offne Räubereien. Dennoch ſind die Gottesdienſte in den beiden Kapellen zu Bathurſt ſowie auf den Predigtplätzen, an denen ſchon kleine Schaaren geſammelt find,?) und die 2) Jene Marabuts, dieſe Soninkis genannt. Die letzteren unterſcheiden ſich we⸗ ſentlich nicht ſehr von Fetiſchdienern. 2) Die letzten Jahresberichte führen unter den letzteren einige Plätze auf, die noch nicht in meinem Atlas zu finden ſind, und über deren Lage keine Angaben vorliegen. So: Moro⸗Cunda, Cotoo und Daranka (Baranka?) Letzteres ſoll außerhalb des britti⸗ ſchen Gebiets liegen. ER 14 DTDPrrientirende Ueberſicht. Schulen meiſt gut beſucht geweſen, und es hat nicht an Zeichen gefehlt, daß das Wort Gottes ſeine Wirkung hat. Nach dem letzten Berichte hatte ſich die Zahl der Gemeindemitglieder um 39 vermehrt. Dieſelbe betrug 744. Wieviel davon Europäer ſind, iſt nicht geſagt. In fünf Schulen waren 495 Schüler; in den Sonntagsſchulen 613. Die katholiſche Miſſion ſcheint in Bathurſt Fortſchritte zu machen, be⸗ ſonders infolge der aufopfernden Thätigkeit, welche bei der auch hier wüthenden Cholera 1869 die Miſſionare und Ordensſchweſtern geübt haben. 2. Die Miſſion am Pongas!) hat in ſo fern ein beſonderes Intereſſe, als ſie zum Theil von Weſtindien aus unterhalten wird. Chriſten afrikaniſcher Abſtammung ſenden der Heimath ihrer Väter das Evangelium. Der Hauptſitz dieſer Weſtindiſchen kirchlichen Miſſions⸗ geſellſchaft iſt Barbados, wo auch im theologiſchen Seminare junge Leute aus der Pongas⸗Gegend zu Miſſionaren ausgebildet werden. Es find jetzt ihrer vier auf eben fo vielen Stationen in der genannten Gegend thätig und ſcheinen ſich als tüchtige Leute, denen auch ein nüchterner, klarer Blick nicht fehlt, zu be⸗ weiſen. Die Leitung dieſer Miſſion liegt in der Hand der Ausbreitungsgeſell⸗ ſchaft (S. P. G.) und ſteht daher unter der Superviſionß des Biſchofs von Sierra Leone. Das Feld hat ſeine eignen Schwierigkeiten. Nachdem ſchon ſeit längerer Zeit namentlich franzöſiſche Faktoreien beſtanden, hat Frankreich im Jahre 1867 förmlich von dieſem Gebiete Beſitz ergriffen. Die Regierung ſcheint ſich jedoch nicht beſonders fühlbar zu machen, und die Miſſion iſt, obwohl der ſchwer er= füllbare Wunſch, daß in den Schulen möge franzöſiſch gelehrt werden, ausge⸗ ſprochen wurde, wie es ſcheint in keiner Weiſe beläſtigt worden. Auch die Euro⸗ päer auf den Faktoreien erweiſen ſich nicht feindſelig, vielmehr wurden von einem Solchen (einem Deutſchen) bei Anlegung einer Station weſentliche Dienſte gelei⸗ ſtet. Ein größeres Hinderniß liegt darin, daß die hier noch ungeſtört geltende Sklaverei ſich immer entſchiedener durch die Predigt des Evangeliums bedroht ſieht, daher ſich die reicheren Eingebornen, welche ſämmtlich Sklaven halten, der letzteren meiſtentheils widerſetzen. An einigen Orten iſt die Bevölkerung zum Theil muhamedaniſch, doch ohne daß der dem Islam eigene Fanatismus hier hervor- träte. Es wird ſtark über die Stumpfheit des Volkes geklagt; Viele erwarten bei ihrem Uebertritt zum Chriſtenthume äußere Vortheile, oder gar direkte Ge— ſchenke. Einzelne Häuptlinge aber haben bereits einen hohen Grad von Bildung und die Miſſion hat unter ihnen warme Freunde. Dieſelbe trägt übrigens einen. ausgeprägt hochkirchlichen Charakter. — Der Zuwachs der ſchon geſa mmelten Gemeinden war freilich nur ein langſamer, ſcheint aber ſicher fortzugehen. An Ueberſetzungen in die hier geſprochene Suſu-Sprache wird rüſtig gearbeitet. Die neuſte der Stationen befindet ſich am Rio Nunez,?) jo daß jetzt ein Küſten⸗ ſtrich von 20 deutſchen Meilen ſich unter dem Einfluſſe dieſer Miſſion befindet. 1) Miſſions⸗Atlas I, 2. 2) Um dieſelbe auf dem betr. Carton (Afrika Nr. 2) zu verzeichnen, müßte man: denſelben etwa um 10 deutſche Meilen nach N. W. erweitern. S Orientirende Ueberſicht. = 15 3. Sierra Leone.) Sierra Leone iſt eines der wenigen Miſſions-Gebiete auf denen die Miſ⸗ ſionsarbeit bereits zu einem gewiſſen Abſchluß gelangt iſt. Neben einem kleinen Theil der Bevölkerung, der am alten Fetiſchdienſte fefthält oder mehr oder weni⸗ ger fi in Religionsloſigkeit verliert, und einem noch kleineren muhamedaniſchen Theile bekennt ſich die überwiegende Menge derſelben zum Chriſtenthum, theils als Anglikaner theils als Methodiſten. Die erſteren find bereits zu einer felbft- ſtändigen kirchlichen Organiſation herangereift; nur einige Stationen ſtehen noch unter Leitung der Church Missionary Society. Die junge Kirche hat in dem bereits vollendeten erſten Jahrzehnte ihres Beſtehens ihre Lebensfähigkeit ge⸗ zeigt. Unter ihren Mitgliedern finden ſich wohlgebildete, vermögende Leute. Die Mehrzahl derſelben ſind kleine Handelsleute, da das felſige Ländchen für die verhältnißmäßig ſtarke Bevölkerung nicht genügenden Platz zum Ackerbau hat. Ihr Vermögen iſt daher den Schwankungen des Handels unterworfen, weshalb auch die Einkünfte der jungen Kirche dann und wann Ungleichmäßigkeit zeigten. Dennoch bringt dieſelbe die erforderlichen Mittel auf. Die in der Kolonie jelbft ausgebildeten Geiſtlichen haben ſich bisher bewährt, ſo daß ihnen ſogar von un— betheiligter Seite das Zeugniß ausgeſtellt iſt, ſie ſeien würdige Nachfolger jener bereits heimgegangenen Miſſionare, durch deren harte doch eifrige Arbeit die Ge— meinden geſammelt find. — Auch die Methodiften haben zumeiſt bereits farbige: Prediger. Ihre Gemeinden aber ſtehen noch immer wie früher in der Verbin— dung mit der Wesleyan M. 8. Die Zahl ihrer vollen Mitglieder, die ſich jährlich um einige Hundert vermehrt, beträgt gegen 5000, während außer dieſen noch faſt doppelt ſoviel Andere ſich zu ihren Gottesdienſten halten. Die Ges ſammtzahl der Anglikaner wird auch jetzt kaum die der mit den Methodiften: Verbundenen erreichen.?) Das chriſtliche Leben der Gemeinden auf beiden Seiten dürfte bei möglichſt billigen Rückſichten nicht grade unbefriedigend zu nennen ſein. Doch macht ſich immer wieder noch ein bedeutender Mangel an Stätigkeit und Feſtigkeit deſſelben fühlbar und von verſchiedenen Seiten wird geklagt, daß es noch auf einer nie- deren Stufe der Sittlichkeit ſteht. Die Ausſchließung von Mitgliedern muß häufig Statt finden; und wenn ſie auch meiſt ſpäter in bußfertiger Weiſe die Wiederaufnahme nachſuchen, ſo kann doch nicht in Abrede geſtellt werden, daß die Sierra⸗Leone⸗Chriſten im Großen und Ganzen es auch mit groben Sünden noch viel zu leicht nehmen; namentlich iſt die Unkeuſchheit ein ſchwerer Schade, auch fehlt es nicht an ſtarken Reſten heidniſchen Aberglaubens, Zauberei ꝛc. Die Gottesdienſte werden durchſchnittlich gut beſucht und auch die Schulen ſind größtentheils in gutem Gange. Die der Anglikaner haben dadurch ſehr gewonnen, daß ſie in engerer Verbindung zur Colonial-Regierung ſtehen, welche einen Zuſchuß zur Unterhaltung liefert, aber auch die Leiſtungen kontrollirt. Einige höhere Schulen gewähren ihren Zöglingen eine verhältnißmäßig gründliche, um— faſſende und gediegene Bildung. Der jetzige Biſchof, erſt ſeit einigen Jahren in dieſem Amte, entfaltet eine 1) Miſſions⸗Atlas I, 3. ir 9 Leider liegen mir die F der neuſten Volkszählung der Kolonien noch uicht vor. 16 Drientirende Ueberſicht. ſehr eifrige Thätigkeit und hat mehrfache förderliche Einrichtungen z. B. auch be⸗ züglich der chriſtlichen Literatur getroffen. Eine große Anzahl Sierra-Leone-Chriſten find nach den benachbarten Kü— ſtenſtrichen ausgewandert und haben ſich daſelbſt in kleinern oder größeren Grup⸗ pen als Handelsleute oder Ackerbauer niedergelaſſen. Inmitten einer heidniſchen Bevölkerung erwachſen dort für ſie größere Gefahren als in der Heimath. Um ſie dem Chriſtenthum zu erhalten und von dieſem Anknüpfungspunkte aus weiter unter den Heiden zu arbeiten, hat die Church M. S. ihre Stationen im Bul⸗ lom⸗, Timneh⸗ und Scherbro-Gebiete.!) Die Arbeit daſelbſt, welche von den Ge- meinden in Sierra⸗Leone unterſtützt wird, hat mit mancherlei Schwierigkeiten zu kämpfen und ſchreitet, obgleich mit Eifer und Treue betrieben, nur langſam vor⸗ wärts. 4. Liberia. ?) Die Nachrichten, die von dieſer Negerrepublik in die Oeffentlichkeit gelangen, kommen ziemlich ſparſam und ſind zum Theil recht farblos. Das erſte halbe Jahrhundert iſt ſeit der Gründung des Freiſtaates verfloſſen; trotzdem befindet ſich derſelbe immer noch in den Anfängen der Entwicklung, im auffallenden Ge⸗ genſatze zu den ſanguiniſchen Hoffnungen mit denen er einſt begrüßt wurde, als er in's Leben trat. Die natürlichen Hinderniſſe, die an dieſem Küſtenſtriche der Kultur entgegenſtehen, mögen groß ſein. Dennoch zeigt ſich an Liberia, daß der Neger für eine ſelbſtſtändige Thätigkeit zur Pflanzung und Verbreitung einer höheren Geſittung wenig Geſchick hat, ſo ſehr ſeine Bildungsfähigkeit im Einzelnen durch zahlreiche, hervorſtechende Beiſpiele bewieſen wird. Es ſind nur wenige Punkte Liberias, die ſich über das Niveau afrikaniſcher Zuſtände erhoben haben. Das Land im Großen und Ganzen iſt noch ohne die allernothdürftigſten Kommunika⸗ tions⸗Mittel, ſowie ohne ſich hebenden Ackerbau und Induſtrie. Es iſt ein we⸗ nig Handel, auf dem das geringe Maß öffentlichen Lebens beruht. Die Miſſion, ſofern ſie mit der kirchlichen Pflege farbiger amerikaniſcher Koloniſten und ihrer Nachkommen zuſammenfällt, ſcheint es, hat mit mancherlei Schwierigkeiten zu kämpfen, da die aus dem chriſtlichen Lande mitgebrachten Untugenden auf afri= kaniſchem Boden üppiger ſich entfalten als die guten Keime. Die Chriſtianiſi⸗ rung der Eingebornen dagegen hat in den dünn bevölkerten Küſtenſtrichen an der erwähnten Unwegſamkeit, abgeſehen von dem ungünſtigen Klima, ihre großen Hemmniſſe. Man lenkt daher mit Recht immer mehr das Augenmerk auf die ungleich beſſer beſetzten Gebirgsländer mit geſunderem Klima welche, etwa 15 bis 20 Meilen von der Küſte landeinwärts gelegen find. Mehrfache Erfor- ſchungsreiſen haben dieſelben in den letzten Jahren erſchloſſen und zugänglich ges funden. Zum großen Theil ſind dieſe Gegenden bereits von einem friedlich vor— dringenden und wenig fanatiſchem Muhammedanismus in Beſitz genommen. — Von den drei in Liberia arbeitenden Miſſionsgeſellſchaften hatte die American Episcopal M.

Die Gold⸗ und Sklavenküſte. ) Dieſes Feld, auf dem inmitten bedeutender Schwierigkeiten ſchon manche lieblichen Blüthen ſproſſen, hat im Laufe mehrerer Jahre viel durch Krieg ges litten. Am meiſten wurde zunächſt die Miſſion der Norddeutſchen Geſell— ſchaft, welche den öſtlichen Theil einnimmt, geſchädigt; jetzt wird die der Wes⸗ leyaner im Weſten ſchwer bedrängt, während die zwiſchen beiden liegende Basler Miſſion, zwar an einem Punkte bereits ſehr hart getroffen, im Gan⸗ zen jedoch noch freier blieb, aber immerhin unter den Einflüſſen des Kriegs- zuſtandes leidet. Es iſt das mächtige Königreich Aſchante, welches wieder einmal aus ſeiner abgeſchloſſenen Lage Verbindung mit dem Meere ſuchend die Negerſtämme jener Küſten in Aufregung bringt. Das brittiſche Protektorat war der ihm hinderliche Damm, den es diesmal öſtlich vom Volta-Fluße zu durchbrechen verſuchte (1869). Dabei wurde der äußerſte Vorpoſten der Basler, die Station Anum zerſtört und die Miſſionare Ramſeyer und Kühne (Erſterer mit ſeiner Gattin) als Ge— fangene nach der Aſchante-Hauptſtadt Kumaſi fortgeſchleppt. Ebenſo wurden die Bremer Stationen Wegbe und Waya geplündert und verwüſtet, doch gelang es den Miſſionaren nach der Küſte zu entkommen. Obwohl der Krieg weite Strecken entvölkerte, erreichte er jedoch nicht ſeinen Zweck. Die reducirten Aſchante-Trup⸗ pen mußten ſich, nach dem ſie lange weit und breit verderblich gehauſt hatten, doch unverrichteter Sache zurückziehen. Schon waren Friedensunterhandlungen im Gange, bei denen auch ernſtlich auf die Erlöſung der gefangenen Miſſionare hin— gewirkt wurde. Ehe dieſelben jedoch zum Abſchluß kamen, erhielt die Lage der Dinge eine andre Richtung durch die Abtretung der holländiſchen Beſitzungen, namentlich Elmina's, an England [April 1872]. Aſchante ſah ſich dadurch eines, wenn auch bisher wenig zu benutzenden Gegengewichtes gegen das engliſche Protektorat beraubt. Sein Herrſcher, obgleich ſelbſt weniger kriegeriſch geſinnt, konnte dem Drängen der Kriegspartei in ſeiner Hauptſtadt nicht widerſtehen. Dazu kamen die Bitten des Königs von Elmina um Befreiung von der engliſchen Oberherrſchaft. So wurde denn zu Anfang dieſes Jahres ein bedeutendes Heer ausgerüſtet, das mit wechſelndem Erfolge bis in die Nähe der Küſte vorgedrun⸗ gen iſt, und jetzt den befeſtigten Hauptplatz Cape Coaſt Caſtle ernſtlich bedroht. Die gefangenen Miſſionare, welche ſchon zu ihrer Auslieferung ſich auf dem Wege nach der Küſte befanden, ſind wieder nach Kumaſie zurückgeführt, und das Ende ihrer nun ſchon über 4 Jahre währenden Gefangenſchaft läßt ſich nicht abſehen. Dabei iſt zu bemerken, daß ihnen dort eine freiere Bewegung vergönnt wird, bei der es ihnen möglich wird, ſelbſt Samenkörner der Wahrheit in der Afchante- hauptſtadt auszuftreuen.?)

(xesellseliaft« - Kapital A OMZSO.OGtzK (lulcleii. ^ Die „Vindobona" verbürgt gegen Be zug einer bestimmten Prämie die pünktliche Zahlung der Zinsen und die rechtzeitige Rück zahlung des dargeliehenen Kapitals. Auf diese Weise setzt sie sich selbst an die Stelle des Schuldners und zahlt sogar aus ihrer Kasse dem Gläubiger die Interessen an den in der Schuld-Urkunde festgesetzten Terminen. Die Präini?, welche die Gesellschaft bezieht, ist dazu bestimmt, die Gefahr, welche sie auf sich nimmt, das versicherte Kapital oder die Zinsen bezahlen zu müssen, so wie allfällige Berluste zn decken, welche sie treffen können. Die Prämie bildet zugleich ein Entgelt dafür, daß die Gesellschaft den Gläubiger vor materiellem Schaden und moralischem Nachtheil bewahrt, sie dient der Gesellschaft als Vergütung für die Vorschüsse, die sie an Stelle des Hypothekar-Schuldners zu machen ge nöthigt werden kann, so wie für die allfälligen Prozeß kosten und die Folgen der verzögerten Hereinbringnug des Kapitals, welche der Darleiher nicht mehr zu fürch ten ha!. Aus dem Gesagten geht unwiderleglich hervor: 1. daß durch die Versicherung für die pünktliche .Zahlung der Zinsen Gewähr geleistet wird, nud daß der Gläubiger 2. für die rechtzeitige Rückzahlung seines darge- liehenen Kapitals nicht mehr besorgt zu sein braucht. Die Gesellschaft allein sorgt dafür uud trägt die dieß- sälligen Gefahren. DerGlänbiger kann sich auf diesem Wege die vollste Beruhigung und ein durchaus gesichertes Einkommen verschaffen; er kaun sein?' Zinsen am Verfallstage jedesmal bei der Kasse der „Vindobona" erheben; er kann sich in Ansehung seines Kapitals vor jedem Ver- luste bewahren. Außer der auf einem bestimmteu Reale haftenden Hypothek erhält er eine zweite Sicherstellung in dem Aktien-Kapitale der Gesellschaft, welche für die genaue Erfüllung der Verpflichtungen des Schuldners einsteht. Sonach folgt, daß durch die bei der „Vindobona" geschehene Versicherung einer Hypothekar - Forderung (eines iutabnliiteu Kapitals) eben sowohl die Cession derselben an einen neuen Gläubiger, als auch die Er neuerung (respektive Prolongation) einer solchen For derung sehr erleichtert wird. Die „Vindobo>»a" stellt sich somit als ein Unter nehmen dar, welches ans einfachster Grundlage beruht, nichtsdestoweniger aber eine ebenso fruchtbare als mannichsache Thätigkeit entwickeln und dem Realkredite die wichtigsten Vortheile verschaffen wird; sie bewahrt nicht nur das dargeliehene Kapital, sondern auch die Realität, auf welcher dasselbe intabulirt ist, vor jeder Gefahr und vor jedem Schaden; sie befestigt und ver doppelt die einmal gegebene Sicherstellung und ver mehrt deren Werth »och dadurch, daß sie die Regelmä ßigkeit und Pünktlichkeit der Zahlungen verbürgt. Die „Vindobotta" erleichtert Anlehen auf Rea litäten, indem sie ihnen größere Sicherheit verschafft, sie erhöht den Werth der unbeweglichen Güter, beför dert in jeder Richtung den Verkehr, dessen Grundlage sie bildet, befestigt den Kredit, begünstigt Ackerbau und Industrie und bietet mit einem Worte sowohl der be sitzenden, als der arbeitenden Klasse hilfreiche Hand, ohne irgend einem Interesse zn schaden. ^ Die Programme und eine Sammlung von BenntzunaSbeispielen, woraus die großen und vielseitigen Vortheile ersichtlich sind, werden bei der Direktion der „Vindobona" in Wien, Stadt, am Hof, Nr. Zedermann bereitwilligst ausgefolgt. «.

Gewöhnlich war es in früheren Jahren ein handfester „Momak," der in solch' einem Hause nebst dem wichtigen Amte eines „Aksia" auch noch die Stelle eines Leibdieners zu versehen hatte. Diese dienenden Geister pflegte man in Serbien in der guten alten Zeit durchwegs auf ein Jahr zu dingen ; erst nach Ablauf dieses Jahres konnte ein solches Dienstverhältniss nach vorangegangener entsprechender Kündigung wie- der gelöst oder erneuert werden. Die Tage der Lösung oder Erneuerung der in Serbien übü- chen Dienstverhältnisse gewöhnlich „Gjurgjev- dan" und „Mitrovdan": das sind die beiden cibyGoogle Kragüjevac. 195 Tage Set. Georg (Frühling) und Erz. Michael (Herbst), wie man also in Nieder - Österreich kurzweg sagen würde die beiden Termine : Georgi und Michaeli. An diesen beiden Tagen wurde auch vom Dienstgeber der JahresJohn ausbezahlt. „Gjur- gjevdan" und „Mitrovdan" waren somit in ei- ner serbischen Stadt immer die beiden grossen Tage des allgemeinen „Rafiun" (Rechnung). Da wurde gewöhnUch von dem betreffen- den dienstbeflissenen Momaken der „Rabus"*) auf dem gewöhnlich der bisher seitens des Dienstgebers genommene Vorschuss gar sorg- fältig durch einzelne eingeschnittene Kreuzlein bezeichnet war, aus der untersten Tiefe der Kleidertruhe hervorgezogen, dann wurde mit dem „Gazda" (Herri^ genau verglichen und gerechnet, und war man mit einander gegen- seitig zufrieden, so wurde dann das Dienstver- hältniss auf ein ferneres Jahr wieder erneuert. Auch bei den serbischen Gewerbsleuten, Handwerkern und Trgovcen alten Schlages herrschte die gleich löbliche Sitte. Glückliches Serbien ! Ob es wol auch noch heute in deinen Gauen dienstbeflissene Moma- ken gibt, die es ein volles Jahr hindurch bei einem einzigen Herrn aushalten? *_) Eine Erklärung des „Rabug" befindet sich in der V. Abtheilung dieses Buches „Arangjelovac Kisela Voda." cibyGoogle 196 Kragujevac. Gjurgjevdan und Mitrovdau, das waren in Serbien die beiden grossen Festtage des die- nenden Volkes. In der Carsia einer serbischen Stadt herrschte an diesen beiden irohen Ta-' gen stets und überall ein überaus reges Leben. War der dienstbeflissene Momak das ganze liebe Jahr hindurch auch noch so nüchtern ge- wesen, an diesen beiden frohen Tagen da hatte er gewiss sein Räuschchen. Für die musizirenden Zigeuner solch' einer Stadt oder solch' eines Städtchens waren dies stets die herrlichsten Tage. Fast aus jeder der Mehanen und Kafanen tönte da Musik heraus, producirt von einer Musikkapelle, die gar lieb- lich anzuhören war und wie ich eine solche in einem der vorhergehenden Kapitel „Serbische Frauen" dem freundlichen Leser bereits ge- schildert. Dazu wurde von den fröhlichen Momaken mochte nun die Gaststube auch noch so klein sein, „Kolo" getanzt; manchmal aber auch förmlich gestrampft, wie es eben kam, so, dass man manchmal zu wähnen glaubte, die ganze ehrbare alte Ordnung sei plötzlich auf den Kopf gestellt. Auch der gestrenge Herr Kapetan (Stadt- hauptmann}, der an solchen Tagen, gefolgt von seinen beiden, bis an die Zähne bewaffneten Panduren, gar fleissig die Runde zu machen pflegte, — pflegte bei solchen Gelegenheiten HcstcdbyGoOgle gerne ein, ja manchmal sogar beide Augen zu- zudrücken; (mein Gott, wer wird auch seines Amtes immer mit voller Strenge walten!). — Gjurgjevdan sowol als auch Mitrovdan, jeder dieser beiden frohen Tage kommt im Kalender des Jahres nur einmal, leider, oder vielleicht zmn Glücke allerruheliebenden serbischen Bur- ger — nur ein einziges Mal vor. Ein merkwürdiges Völkchen sind auch die serbischen Zigeuner. Die Zigeuner wohnen in den serbischen Städten in eigenen Stadttheilen „Zigeuner-Viertel," Man pflegt in Serbien manch- mal auch zu sagen; Dieser oder Jener wohnt unter den „Kovacen," also unter den Schmie- den, was so viel sagen will, als: der Betref- fende wohnt unter den Zigeunern, — da in Ser- bien fast der grösste Theil der sesshaften Zi- geuner des edlen Handwerkes kundig ist. Doch nicht alle serbischen Zigeuner be- treiben dieses ihr erlerntes Handwerk, viele derselben betreiben einen höchst schwungvollen Pferdehandel. Andere wieder betreiben das oft nicht minder einträgliche Geschäft eines Kocsiaschen*) wieder andere verdienen sich ihr Brod als Mu- siker oder verdingen sich als Diener. Die in Serbien in festen Wohnsitzen also in den Zi- geunervierteln der verschiedenen serbischen * Siehe Kapitel I „Aus meiner Reisenmappe" — Ziegeunerkoöias. cibyGoogle 198 Kragujevac. Städte und Flecken wohnenden Zigeuner be- kennen sich durchwegs zum Christenthume. Sie haben in ihrem Zigeunerviertel ihren eige- nen Ortsvorstand zugleich Richter (Kmetj und herrscht unter ihnen strenge Zucht und Ord- nung denn so ein Zigeuner-Kmet versteht noch weniger einen Spass als etwa der ehren- werthe Kapetan in der Carsia wo er den ge- bührenden Respeckt vor dem Gesetze nament- hch aber vor seinem eigenen Ich als „Amts- person" in seiner Gemeinde nicht findet, dort weiss er sich denselben in einer für die Be- treffenden stets äusserst empfmdlichen Weise zu verschaffen, denn wozu gäbe es dem sonst auch „Aps" (Arest) und Battina (Prügel). — Die Reinlichkeit solch eines serbischen Zigeunervirtels, die hegt freilich manchesmal ein wenig im Argen, nichtsdestoweniger hält der serbische Zigeuner aufsein „Viertel" grosse Stücke, sAs echter Natursohn hat er jedoch noch immer für etwaige allzugrosse Reinlich- keitsgelüste dieses oder jenes seiner Nachbarn höchstens ein verächtliches Lächeln. In solch einem serbischen Zigeunerviertel herrscht oft ein recht abenteuerliches Leben. Aus den zahlreichen Schmieden die sich ge- wöhnlich in solch einem Viertel befinden dringt das Pochen der Hämmer heraus auf die Strasse und eint sich hier harmonisch mit dem Krei- schen der Weiber und Schreien der Kinder, cibyGoogle Kragujevac. 199 ab und zu unterbrochen von dem lieblichen Quiken der zahlreich auf der Strasse sich he- rumtummelnden Ferkel, dem Gakern der Hüh- ner und Krähen der Hähne. Da lässt vor seinem Hause ein alter Zi- geuner mit- lang herabfallenden silbergrauen Haupthaare, einen abgemagerten Gaul Revue passiren, — ein • anderer jüngerer Stammes- genosse huft wieder sein Rösslein bei einem der in der sCaräia" befindlichen „Kovaien" (Schmieden). Ein Dritter wieder reparirt vor seinem Hause eben seine Taljige,*) kurz es herrscht unter diesem Zigeuner-Völkchen überall wo man hinblickt stets eine rege Thätigkeit. Die liebe Zigeunerjugend wälzt und balgt sich auf der Strasse, theils halbnackt, theils in zerfetzte Lumpen gehüllt herum während schlanke hübsche geschmückte Zigeunermädchen neben runzeligen Tabak kauenden und Tabak schmau- chenden alten Hexen ihren Rocken spinnend vor ihren baufälligen von einem schweren Ce- ramida-Dache**) belasteten Hütten sitzen. So eine jugendliche „Ziganka" aus solch *) Taijige nennt man in Serbien auch im 1 einen leicht gebauten Leiterwagen. **) Ceramida nennt man die in Serbien als Deck- material üblichen Dachziegel.

Von Kragujevac aus lühren auch einzelne gut gebaute Strassen nach allen übrigen Thei- len des Landes. Kragujevac ist mithin auch als Handels- platz bedeutend, denn es bildet vermöge seiner günstigen Lage sozusagen den Mittelpunkt des serbischen Verkehres. Wenn einmal das schwerfallige Kola (Last- wagen) des Rabad^ija*} bisher nahezu das ein- zig dankbare Waarentransportmittel Serbiens durch die Lokomotive ersetzt sein wird, wenn der serbische Seijak (Bauer) ferner einmal ge- lernt haben wird, gleich seinem Staatsgenossen im Westen" — den Segen einer rationellen Be- wirthung seines bisher nur schlecht gepflegten trotz dem aber äusserst furchtbaren Grund und Bodens kennen zu lernen, die Entwickelung des serbischen Gewerbefleisses ferner — im Gegensatze zu dem bisher herrschendem Drange nach möglichst mühelosen Erwerbe, gleichen Schritt halten wird, mit der politisch ziemlich weit vorgeschrittenen Entwicklung des neuen *) „Aus meiner cibyGoogle Kragujevac.

Belgrad. An die duftigen Märchen der „Seherasa- de" darf man wol nicht denken, wenn man den Bord des Semllner Localdampfers verlassend, die Savestadt (Waaserstadt) Belgrad betritt, und dann die hundert so und so viel Stufen em- porsteigt, welche vom Belgrader Hafenplatze aus zur Oberstadt, der serbischen Residenz emporfuhren. Die „goldene Zeit" der orientalischen Mär- chen ist für Belgrad längst dahingeschwunden; ihr lolgte, fast mit dem gänzlichen Abzüge der Türken aus Serbien zugleich {1867), wie dem Traume die Ernüchterung, — das Zeitalter der werkthätigen, menschenveredelnden Arbeit. Von dem alten Belgrad der Türken, der „Pforte der Religionskriege," ist heute mit Aus- nahme der altehrwürdigen Veste, kaum mehr eine Spur vorhanden. An Stelle der ehemaligen Türkenstadt der „Dorcol," erhebt sich heute ein nahezu neuer Stadttheil. Sind auch die hier aufgeführten neuen Baulichkeiten nicht alle nach unseren westeuro- päischen Begriffen, einer Residenzstadt entspre- chend, grossartig angelegt, so gewähren die zumeist nett getünchten, wenn auch zumeist cibyGoogle Belgrad. 203 nur bescheiden grossen Häuser und Häuschen die man hier antrifft, im Gegensatze zu den einst fast durchwegs abenteuerlich zerfetzten Ba- raken der Türken an der gleichen Stelle, - — doch immerhin noch einen recht leidlichen Anblick. Auch der einst zwischen Stadt und Veste Belgrad verödet dagelegene wüste Platz, der „Kalemegdan" ist heute bereits zu einer schat- tigen Parkanlage umgewandelt. In der nächsten Nähe dieser Parkanlage befindet sich auch das Hotel zur „serbischen Krone," wo man , iür verhältnissmässig wenig Geld ganz anständig zu speisen vermag, vor- ausgesetzt jedoch, dass man in seinen Ansprü- chen recht bescheiden ist. Einen hübschen Anblick gewährt die Bel- grader Kathedrale mit ihrem schlanken Glo- ckenthurme, der mit einem überaus reich ver- goldeten, kühn geschwungenen Kupferhelme bedeckt ist. In der unmittelbaren Nähe dieser grössten Kirche Belgrad's, welche dem Erz. St. Michael geweiht ist, befindet sich auch der „Konak" des serbischen Metropoliten und das Seminar. Die schönste Strasse der serbischen Haupt- stadt ist die „Terasia", doch hat man von der Savestadt aus einen ziemlich beschwerlichen Weg empor zu klettern bis man sich seines Spazierganges auf dem Belgrader „Boulevard" zu erfreuen vermag. Hcstcdbv Google 304 Belgrad. Die „Terasia" schmückt nebst einer von prächtigen Kastanienbäumen gebildeten Allee auch noch ein von Fürst MiloS Obrenovic er- bauter monumentaler Brunnen Auf der „Terasia" befinden sich auch die einzelnen Hotels der verschiedenen Gesand- schaften am Belgrader Hofe ; ferner auch der „Konak" des Fürsten und in der unmittelbaren Nähe des „Konak" auch die verschiedenen Ministerien, ferner auch das Senatsgebäude nebst noch mehreren anderen Staatsgebäuden, Das prachtvollste Gebäude Belgrads ist bis heute noch immer das Universitäts-Gebäude auf der „velika Piaca" (grossen Platze) gelegen und vom Volke kurzweg „Kapetan Misino zdanije" genannt; denn ein reicher Serbe Major Misa, der, der Volkssage nach ursprünglich ein armer Schiffsknecht gewesen sein soll, hat diesen prächtigen Palast seinem Vaterlande zum Ge- schenke gemacht. Der eben erwähnte Palast soll den Erbau- er ungefähr eine halbe Million gekostet haben. Eine goldene Innschrift über dem Mittel- Risalit der Hauptfront, verkündet der Nach- welt diesen Akt der Grossmuth eines serbischen Bürgers ungefähr mit folgenden Worten; „Miäa Anastasijevic seinem Vaterlande." Die Architek- tur des prächtigen Baues ist eine ziemlich ab- wechslungsreiche. Das umfangreiche Gebäude entfällt nebst der Belgrader Hochschule auch cibyGoOgle Belgrad. 205 noch die National-Bibliothek, ferner das Natio- nal-Museum und eine überaus reichhaltige Mün- zensammlung Von dem ziemlich hoch liegenden Pavillon des serbischen Universitäts-Gebäudes aus, zu dem eine schön gebaute Stiege emporführt vermag man auch einen herrlichen Ausblick zu geniesen. An dem gegenüberliegenden Stromufer sieht man die schmucken Dampfer der Donau- Dampfschifffahrtsgesellschaft, dicht vor dem schattigen Donauufer- Parke des freundlichen Semlin, vor Anker liegen, umgeben von ein- zelnen schwer beladenen Schleppschiffen. Leider wird man bei längerer Betrachtung des majestätisch dahinrauschenden Danaustrom- mes, der von der Belgrader hohen Warte aus , gesehen mit seiner Umgebung einen überaus prächtigen Anblick gewährt, durch den überaus schwachen Schiffsverkehr auf seinem silber- glänzenden Fluthen fast unwillkührlich auch daran erinnert dass hier noch für die umlie- genden Donauuferstaaten, eine gewaltige Aul- gabe ihrer Lösung harre. An bedeutenden durch ihre Grösse oder ihren architektorischen Schmuck hervorragen- der Bauten ist die serbische Königs-Residenz noch keineswegs reich. Der Belgrader Bürger ist bis heute noch immer so glücklich, auch wenn er nicht immer HcstcdbyGoOgle Belgrad. ; ein wolhabender Mann ist sein eigenes Heim besitzen zu können. Solch ein bürgerliches Familien-Wohnhaus, in welches sich in den meisten Fällen auch ein kleines Hausgärtchen anschliesst enthält ausser denjenigen Räunllichkeiten, welche der Besitzer als Wohnräume für sich und seine Fa- milie, oder etwa auch noch als Betriebslokale für sein Geschäft oder sein Gewerbe benöthigt nur äusserst selten auch noch einige wenige Wohnungen für fremde Miethparteien. Mit vielen Partheien in ein und demselben Hause beisammen zu wohnen, mit solch' einem Gedanken kann sich der Belgrader Bürger noch immer nicht befreunden. Die Folge davon ist, dass Belgrad wol von Jahr zu Jahr an Ausdehnung zunimmt; an stattlichen Gebäuden jedoch nur wenig gewinnt; mit Ausnahme jener Neubauten, welche eben unbedingt schon des Zweckes halber, dem sie nach ihrer Vollendung zu dienen haben, eine grössere, als die sonst übliche Anlage erheischen. Im Jahre 1854 zählte Belgrad 16.733 Ein- wohner, darunter 14.486 Serben und etwa 1000 österr. Staatsbürger. 18 Jahre später (1872) zählte Belgrad 26.674 Einw., darunter etwa an 50O0 Katholiken (zumeist österr. Staatsbürger) etwa 500 Protestanten (Deutsche, Slaven, auch Ungarn) und 1600 Juden. Heute dürfte Belgrad ungefähr 30.000 Einwohner zählen.' Noch kurz cibyGoogle Belgrad. 207 vor dem Abzüge der Türken waren tüchtige einheimische Handwerker in Belgrad selten; sämmtliche Gewerbszweige ruhten zu jener Zeit fast ausschliesslich noch in Händen fremder, zumeist deutscher Handwerker; heute jedoch, also nach kaum 15 Jahren, kann man in Bel- grad fast auf allen modernen Gewerbszweigen auch tüchtige serbische Handwerker bereits thätig fmden. Es gibt in Belgrad ungefähr 17 grössere Gasthöfe, die alle den stolzen Titel „Hotel" führen. So kenne ich ein Hotel: „Paris," „Kö- nig von Serbien," „Kronprinz," „Serbische Krone," „Balkan," „Europa," „National," „Ma- cedonien." „Bajloni," „London," „Löwe," „Gol- denes Kreuz," »Kragujevac" u. a. m. Findet man unter den oben erwähnten verschiedenartigen Aushängschilden auch nicht immer das, was man vielleicht dahinter zu su- chen, berechtigt wäre, so bekundet doch auch schon das blosse Vorhandensein dieser grösse- ren Gasthöfe mit einem Rückblicke auf das einstige Belgrad, immerhin schon einen bedeu- tenden Aufschwung. Kafanen, Mehanen und Kaufläden gibt es auch in Belgrad selbstverständlich eine Un- zahl nur herrscht in diesem verschiedenartigen • Geschäftslokalen nicht immer jenes ungezwun- gene Treiben wie in den ähnlichen Lokalen der serbischen Provinzstädte, denn der Belgra- clbyGOOglC 208 Belgrad. der Trgovac spielt sich bereits mit Vorliebe ^uf den Grosstädter hinaus, was ihm jedoch nicht immer recht gelingen will. Den beliebtesten Sommerausflug der Bel- grader bildet entweder ein Spaziergang nach dem etwa 6 Kilometer von der serbischen Hauptstadt entfernt liegenden „Topschider" oder aber ein solcher nach dem „Tasch mai- dan" dem Belgrader Steinbruch. Besonders an Sonn- und Festtagen herrscht im Lustgarten von Topschider und ganz be- sonders um die „haiducka Cesma" (Heiduken Ouelle) herum ein überaus fröhliches Leben. Man gibt sich hier wessen Geschlechtes man auch ist, ungezwungen dem allgemeinen Ver- gnügen hin. Verschiedene Gesellschaftsspiele, Gesang und Tanz, ein Spaziergang durch den präch- tigen Park, dazu heiteres Geplauder etwa auch noch ein klein wenig Stadtklatsch, vermögen solch einen frohen Nachmittag wol ganz zweck- entsprechend auszufüllen. — Einer ganz besonderen Beliebtheit erfreuen sich in Belgrad auch die Militär- Concerte, be- sonders bei den schönen Belgraderinnen. Da vermag man so manchesmal bei solch' einem Concerte, wenn oft plötzlich eine der beliebten nationalen Weisen in die, eines noch viel beliebteren Kolo umschlägt, an dem Auf- blitzen so manches feurigen Augenpaares an Ho.tcdbyGoOgle belgrad. 20« den Bewegungen so manches ungeduldigen Füss- chens, zu erkennen, dass man allem fremdar- tigen Aufputze zum Trotze, der da bei sol- chen Gelegenheiten zur Schau getragen zu werden pflegt, noch immer echte Töchter Ser- biens vor sich habe. Auch ein Nationaltheater besitzt Belgrad, ein ganz hübsches Gebäude, welches ungefähr an der Stelle der einstigen „Stambul-Kapija"*) erbaut ist. In der, hinter dem Theater liegenden „Diamija" (türkische Moschee) ist der Gasome- ter des Theaters angebracht. Das Belgrader Theater hat nämlich seine eigene Gasbeleuch- tung, während die serbische Residenz selbst einer regelrechten Beleuchtung noch immer ent- gegensieht. Die sociale Stellung der am Belgrader Na- tionaltheater angestellten Schauspieler ist eine ganz ähnliche, als die unserer Hofschauspieler. Sie sind gewissermassen Beamte des Staates, und als solche pensionsfähig. Das serbische Theaterrepertoir ist ziem- lich reichhaltig. Nebst vielen, theils aus dem Französischen, theils aus dem Deutschen übersetzten Stücken enthält es bereits auch so manches vortrefflich *) Daa alte Belgrad hatte nämlich vier Thore ; Sava- VaroS-, yidiii- und Stanibul-Kapija. Letzteres wur- de von Österreich erbaut. o.ifdbv Google.. 210 Belgrad. gearbeitete heimische Lustspiel, Reich ist das serbische Theaterrepertoir an nationalen Hel- denstüclten; die beliebten Stücke: „Car Lazar^" „Miloä Obilic," „Nemanja" u.a.m. finden a.ich heute noch immer ein dankbares Publikum, Am Tage des St. Markus {25. April a St.) da wird in Belgrad auf dem grossen Platze der Palelula, dort, wo die hübsche Palelulakirche*) sich erhebt, welche dem St. Markus geweiht ist, — alljährig ein grosses Volksfest abgehalten, Wer an diesem Tage Belgrad besucht, der wird an dem fröhlichen Treiben, das er an die- sem allgemeinen F"esttage in der serbischen Haupt- stadt anzutreffen vermag, gewiss Gefallen finden Den Glanzpunkt dieses alljährig wiederkeh renden Volksfestes bildet selbstverständlich eben- so, wie dies bei ähnlichen FestUchkeiten im In- nern Serbiens der Fall ist, ein fröhlicher Kolo. In Belgrad erscheinen gegenwärtig an 20 ver- schiedene Zeitungen. An politischen Journalen u.a., z. B.: „Srpske Novine," „Istok," „Hriican- ski Vesnik," „Samouprava," „Srpska Nezavis-* nost, " „ Videlo, " „Radnik, " „Srpska Kraljevina, " *) Belgrad liat 3 griechische Kirchen u: z die scfaon erwähnte Kathedrale, dann die ebeu ei-wähute Palelulakirche (Palelula, ein Stadttheil Belgrad's) und die von Fürst Michael Obrenovic III. erbaute Belgrader Gamisonskirche'. Ausserdem gibt es in Belgrad noch eine evangelieche, Kii-che, ferner eine katholische Kapelle im öaterr.-ungar. Consulatsge- bäude, zwei Synagogen und eine türkische Moschee. cibyGoogle Belgrad. 211 „Otacbina",,Naroclno Zdravlje," „Dar-Mar" (hu- mor,) u.a.m. Aber nicht alle serbischen Blätter er- scheinen gerade in Belgrad, einige kommen wol auch aus dem benachbarten Ungarn herüber; soz. B. das beliebte und ganz vortrefflich redigirte, in Neusatz erscheinende älteste serbische Fa- tnilienblatt „Javor," in welchem sich nicht nur zahlreiche hübsche Dichtungen serbischer Dich- ter und Dichterinnen von dies- und jenseits der Donau und Save vorfinden, nebst ganz hübsch gehaltenen Novellen und Erzählungen, ferner auch Berichten über Theater, Kunst und Lite- ratur, — sondern auch deutsche Dichter fin- den da durch einzelne vortreffliche Übersetzun- gen aus ihren Werken — verdiente Anerkenunng, Aber auch deutsche Zeitungen werden in Belgrad gelesen man findet namentlich die grös- seren Wiener Journale, wol auch einige unga- rische Blätter, fast in allen bedeutenderen öf- fenthchen Lokalen aufliegen. Dass sich seit Jahren bereits auch unsere illustrirten Zeitschriften, darunter namentlich ^Gartenlaube," „Über Land und Meer," „liust- rirte Welt," „Neue Wiener lUustrirte Zeitung" u. a. m. — in Belgrad Eingang verschafft ha- ben, ■ ist nahezu selbstverständlich. Wohnt ja doch auch so manche deutsche Familie in Bel- grad, und einer solchen ist ebenso gut, als den gebildeten Serben selbst, ein gutes FamlHenblatt nahezu unentbehrlich. clbyGoÖ^IC 219 Es läge nun, bei einem kurzen Rückblicke auf das über Belgrad bisher Gesagte, die Versuchung nahe, auch ein klein wenig Politik zu treiben. Doch ich schweige. — Eingedenkt des, diesem bescheidenen Wer- ke vorangesetzten Titels: „Bilder aus dem ser- bischen Volks- und Familienleben" breche ich meine Schilderungen in dem Augenblicke ab, als ich, die mir selbst gezogene Grenze zu überschreiten, gezwungen wäre; vielleicht ist es mir jedoqh bei einer anderen Gelegenheit ge- gönnt, das etwa Versäumte nachzuholen. In der v. Millerischen Erzgiesserei (königl. Erzgiesserei) in München geht ein prächtiges Denkmal seiner Vollendung entgegen; es ist die für Belgrad bestimmte Reiterstatue des, um sein Vaterland hochverdienten Serbenfürsten Michael Obrenovic III, (geboren i6. September 1823, + 10. Juni 1868). Möge dieses kunstvolle Erzbild, wenn es einmal seinen Ehrenplatz in der serbischen Kö- nigs-Residenz einnimmt, vori dort aus dem strebsamen Serbenvolke, indem es dasselbe an die hervorragenden Tugenden seines einstigen Fürsten erinnert, - — als immerwährendes Vor- bild dienen, in den bitteren Tagen der Noth und Parteizerklüftung sowol, als auch in den sonnigen Tagen des Glückes. cibyGoogle W WHSBREM f. ^atkm. -vlt 3a» eKön-iatfi.wiM. in Set-tietv otocla- ■"tnit-t, Mnä |cfioM «in «etico cBucfk iV{>M.

Der Prager Kongreß ist nur eine Demonstration, welche die Föderalisten wegen des Fiasko, das sie erlebt haben, trösten soll. Die Demonstration wird allem Anscheine nach kläglich ausfallen. Die Polen konferenz dagegen soll auf die Entwicklung unserer inneren Politik von Einfluß sein. Pester Blätter konstatiren, daß der Ausgleich mit den Polen jetzt auf der Tagesordnung steht, und zwar durch die Einwirkung deS Grafen Andraffy, der indessen in einigen Organen behaupten läßt, daß er sich gar nicht in unsere innere Politik einmische, sondern mir den Polen den freundschaftlichen Rath ertheilt habe, ihre Forderung auf ein Minimum zu beschränken, da die gegenwärtige Situation der Ausgleichs- idee keineswegs günstig sei. Die cisleithanische Kabinetsbildung scheint für den Augenblick von - der Tagesordnung abgesetzt zu sein, und zwar vorzugsweise aus dem Grunde, weil sich kein Nachfolger findet. In der That! Wenn schon früher jeder Politiker von Talent und Charakter sorgfältig mit sich zu Rath gehen mußte, ob es ihm gestattet sei, unter den bestehenden Ver hältnissen ein Portefeuille anzunehmen, so wird es jetzt, nachdem es offen bar geworden ist, in welcher Richtung Graf Andraffy seinen Einfluß geltend macht, noch schwieriger sein, einen unabhängigen Staatsmann für das cisleithanische Ministerium zu gewinnen. Man nennt mehrere Namen, darunter auch solche, die im ver fassungstreuen Lager einen guten Klang haben, wir glauben aber, daß diejenigen Recht behalten werden, welche die Fortdauer des Provisoriums in Aussicht stellen. Ob das interimistische Ministerium zrw Auflösung der föderalistischen illegalen Landtage schreiten werde, darüber werden nur Vermuthungen ausgesprochen. Die offiziöse „Pester Korr." dementirt die Meldung, daß im unga rischen Ministerium Aenderungen bevorstehen. Namentlich denkt Graf Lo- nyay nicht an die Uebernahme des Finanzportefeuilles. Unter den Bonapartisten in Paris herrschen —wie der „K.Z." geschrieben wird — seit einigen Tagen große Besorgnisse, da sie auS Chiselhurst die Nachricht erhalten hatten, daß der Exkaiser sich mit der Exkaiserin entzweit hat und diese deshalb so lange Zeit in Spanien ver weilt. Was den Kaiser nämlich sehr unangenehm berührt hat, ist dcrUm- stand, daß sich der bekannte Marineoffizier Duperrs in ihrem Gefolge befindet und, wie auch beim Ausbruch des Krieges, einen großen Einfluß auf sie ausübt. Dieser Duperrö ist der Nämliche, welcher in den von der September-Regierung veröffentlichten Tuilerien-Papicren vielfach genannt wird, der, wie aus diesen hervorgeht, damals der Hauptrathgeber der Kaiserin war und nicht wenig dazu beitrug, daß der Kaiser, nach Wörth und Forbach, nicht nach Paris zurückkoinmen durfte, wie er zuerst gewollt hat. Die Bonapartisten befürchten nun, daß es unter diesen Umständen zu einem offenen Bruch zwischen dem exkaiserlichen Ehepaar kommt nnd dadurch ihre Projekte bedeutend beeinträchtigt, wenn nicht ganz vereitelt werden. Herr v. Banneville soll nicht französischer Botschafter in Wien bleiben und in Paris tauchen bereits neue Kandidaten auf. Herr Thiers hatte ganz besonders den Herzog v. Bisaccia-La-Rochefoucauld für die österreichische Botschaft in Aussicht genommen; doch fand sich der Herzog nicht bereit, aus das ihm gemachte Anerbieten einzugehen. Das viel ver breitete Gerücht, der Kriegsminister General Cissey, begehre seinerseits nach Berlin als diplomatischer Vertreter Frankreichs gesandt zu werden, gilt an unterrichteter Stelle für durchaus unbegründet; wenngleich es nicht wenige französische Politiker von Einfluß gibt, welche für die Berliner Botschaft ausschließlich einen gewiegten Soldaten gewählt sehen möchten. Fürst Metternich, der die in seinem Hotel angeordneten baulichen Verände rungen ruhig fortsetzen läßt, wird binnen Kurzem in Paris wieder ein treffen. Die vielfach umhergetragcne Nachricht von seiner bevorstehenden Ersetzung durch einen ungarischen Diplomaten gilt, nach den Pariser- Briefen eines rheinischen Blattes, als unzuverlässig. Das Verbleiben des Fürsten in seiner gegenwärtige» Stellung hält man noch für längere Zeit gesichert. f Wie man jetzt weiß, war die „bonapnrtislische Messe" am Euge- " nicnlage in der Madcleine-Kirche zu Paris nicht verboten worden. Es hatten sich Anhänger der gestürzten Dynastie, darunter Graf Bcncdetti, eingefunden. Ein Theil der Anwesenden unterzeichnete eine aufgelegte Adresse an die Exkaiserin. Die Unterzeichneten, am 15. November 1871 tu der Madeleine- Kirche aus Anlaß des Sankt-Eugenien-Tages versammelt, haben an den Himmel ihre Gebete für die kaiserliche Familie gerichtet. Der offiziöse Telegraph stellt in Abrede, daß die Hauptstadt von Korsika der Schauplatz ernsterer Exzesse gewesen sei. Es gehen indeß Meldungen dieses Inhalts nicht bloß den bonapartistischen, sondern auch anderen und minder verdächtigen Organen, wie z. B. dem „Univers" zu. Derselbe entnimmt einer Depesche aus Ajaccio, daß Truppen gegen einen Auflauf in dieser Stadt aufgeboten wurden und ohne die vorschrifts mäßige Verwarnung, auch sonst mit einer gewissen Brutalität eingeschrit ten wären; Blut sei geflossen und mehrere Personen seien verwundet worden; der Maire von Ajaccio, Herr Fil, hätte seine Entlassung gege ben. Aehnliches meldet der „Ordre", nur mit noch grelleren Farben, darnach hätten die Soldaten, indem sie öffentlich Spottlieder auf den Ex-Kaiser sangen, die Bürgerschaft aufgebracht und den Konflikt herbei geführt. Die Regierung wird sich wohl authentischer über die Sache äußern müssen. Eine Unterredung mit Thiers. Aus Paris theilt der Korrespondent des „Daily Telegraph" einen Bericht über eine Unterredung mit Thiers mit, dem wir Folgendes ent nehmen : Auei'ft wui'de ausführlich iifwv-k*» fllnn diesem ging die Unterredung zu den bonapartistischen Bewegungen über und der Berichterstatter fragte den Präsidenten mit dürren Worten, ob er die Geschichten glaube, welche man in den letzten Monaten hin sichtlich bonapartistischer Verschwörungen und einer herannahenden Reaktion in Umlauf gesetzt. Ueber diesen Punkt war Thiers nicht sehr mit theilsam. „An Intriguen glaube ich," erwiederte er, „aber nicht an Reaktion. Was ist Ihre Meinung? Sie sehen Leute der verschiedensten Klaffen und Meinungen und vor Ihnen als Engländer nimmt man keinen Anstand, sich auszusprechen. Glauben Sie, daß eine Reaktion zn Gunsten des Bonapartismns eingetreten ist?" „Ich glaube nicht", versetzte der Korrespondent. „Ich habe bisher keinen Mann von bedeu tender Stellung in Paris, noch weniger in der Provinz gesehen, der sich nach der Rückkehr des Kaisers gesehnt hätte. Es gibt Ladcnbesitzer sin Paris, welche diesen Wunsch allerdings äußern, und dabei von der Hoff nung beseelt sind, daß mehr Geld in Umlauf kommen nnd ihr Gewinn besser ausfallen würde. So gibt es auch Journalisten, welche mit lauter Stimme von der Rückkehr des Kaisers sprechen und erklären, es bleibe Frankreich nichts übrig, als sich wieder zum persönlichen Regiment zu bekehren. Diese Leute aber stellen nicht die wirkliche öffentliche Meinung Frankreichs dar. Fremde lesen in Paris diese Zeitungen, sehen nur, was auf der Oberfläche liegt, wissen nicht wie die Drähte gezogen werden oder wer die Drähte in Bewegung setzt, nnd glauben, was sie gedruckt sehe«, eben weil cs gedruckt ist." Herr Thiers — fährt der Bericht erstatter in seinen Mittheilungen fort' — hörte mit Aufmerksamkeit diese Bemerkungen an und sagte sodann, er glaube, ich habe die Sache richtig beurtheilt. Bezüglich der Artikel, welche kürzlich in einigen nltraradikalen Zei tungen erschienen waren, war Herr Thiers ausnehmend vorsichtig. Er sagte, es gebe einen Punkt, über welchen hinaus keine Regierung, nicht einmal die englische, die Presse gehen lassen könne. Uebrigens müsse mau aber doch in gegenwärtiger Zeit mit Rücksicht auf die aufgeregte Stim mung des Volkes große Nachsicht üben. Mit der Zeit werde. sich d c Aufregung wahrscheinlich schon legen. Einige Worte über die bessere Disziplin nnd Haltung der Armee brachten die Rede aus Frankreichs Kricgsvorbereitungen. Die Rede Bismarcks im deutschen Reichstage über die Erhöhung der Gehalte für die Botschafter und Gesandten lassen wir theilweise hier folgen: Es liegt in den Geldverhältniffen sowohl wie in den politischen, daß der Etat deS deutschen Reiches für die au-wärtigen Angelegenheiten seinen Höhepunkt bisher nicht erreicht hat. Einmal vermindert sich der Werth des Geldes und das, was für d>e Gehalte gekauft werden muß, wird theurer in einem Maßstabe, der Ihnen ja bekannt sein wird. Außerdem aber steigt der Anspruch aus würdige Ver tretung mit der Größe und Bedeutung des vertretenen Reiches. Ich möchte bitten, ein- für allemal bi« angebliche Aeußerung Friedrichs des Großen zu Grabe zu tragen. Frietrich der Große hat einen viel zu guten Geschmack gehabt, um von seinem Gesandten zu verlangen, daß er an den Tegen schlagen solle, wenn es sich darum handelte, ein Diner zu erwidern und zu sagen. Ich gebe kein Diner, es stehen 100,000 M. hinter mir. (Heiterkeit.) Ich will nicht behaupten, daß der Ein fluß eines Gesandten nothwendig mit der Höhe seines Gehaltes steigt. Ich g'aube, der Einstuß, den er in dem Lande, in dem er accreditirt ist. für daS Land, das ihn entsendet, mit den Hilfsmitteln, die ihm sein Gehalt verschafft, auszuüben vermag, beruht weit mehr auf Traditionen alter Zeiten, wo es noch möglich war. mit einem guten Diner einen tieferen Eindruck zu machen. Heutzu tage essen Alle gut, und die Diplomaten nicht an, besten (Heiterkeit). Aber aus denselben Gründer, und in demselben Sinne, in welchem das deutsche Reich sich ein Gebäude für ein Ministerium, für ein Parlament errichtet, welches nicht blos dem ftrengsten praktischen Bedürfnisse nach dem Anschlage des Mindeslfordernden ange messen sein, sondern in würdiger Ausstattung davon Zeugniß ablegen soll, wie das deutsche Reich ein grobes, mächtiges Gebilde ist und sich auch als solches fühlt, in demselben Sinne möchte ich Sie bitten, darauf zu halten, daß das deutsche Reich im Auslande in einer Weise vertreten sei, die dem Auge des durchschnittlichen Beobachters auch äußerlich den Eindruck macht: hler stecken die Mittel und das Selbstgefühl eines großen Landes dahinter. Die Bedeutung dieses Momentes wird ,n dem Grade geringer, in welchem die Bevölkerung des Landes, wo er accreditirt ist, durchgehend politisch gebildet ist In einem Lande hoher politischer Bildung wird das Gefühl, das aus dem Wort Friedrich de- Großen von den 100.000 Mann spricht, leichter Eingang finden. Es gehört aber dazu schon ein feinere»"Äbstraktionsvermögen: der groben Maste ist es nicht gleichgilsig, ob der amtliche Vertreter des deutschen Reiches große Mittel vertritt oder kleine.

Unwillkürlich ist das Urtheil bei mitt lerem Bildungsdurchschnili ein klein wenig oura, oie An ver Vertretung gefärbt. Wer in weniger civilisirten Ländern gelebt hat, der wird diese Behauptung in noch höherem Grade für giltig halten müsten. Dort ist unser Auftreten immer auch ein Theil der Forderung unserer Jnteresten. Aber selbst bei den civilisirtesten Nationen find die großen Masten noch nicht auf dem Grade der Bildung, daß sie ganz frei wären von dem Eindruck des gesellschaftlichen Ansehens, das der Vertreter des deutschen Reiches dort genießt, wo er acc edilirt ist Ob Jemand Botschafter oder Gesandter ist, hat mit rer Sache an sich so sehr viel nicht zu thun. Ich würde darauf an und für sich kein so hohes Gewicht legen: es kommt vielmehr darauf an, ob Jemand die Mittel zur Disposition bat, um würdig auf treten zu können. Ein Gesandter mit 40.000 Thaler Gehalt in einem imposanten Hotel mit stattlichem Privaivermögen, ist mir in dieser Beziehung lieber, als ein Botschafter mit 30.000 Thaler, der nicht im Stande ist, seinem Range, sowie der Größe und Würde des deutschen Reiches gemäß zu leben und sich zu tragen. Ich gehe nicht darauf ein. wie peinlich es für den Betheiligten selbst sein muß, sich all' den kleinen Kränkungen der Rivalität und der Eitelkeit ausgesetzt zu s.hen, um so peinlicher, wenn diese Empfindlichkeiten zugleich mit dem Gefühl verbunden sind, daß er sie als Vertreter eines großen Landes in amtlicher Eigenschaft erleidet. Ich habe einen Gesandten mit Recht sagen gehört: „Als Privatmann will ich den untersten Platz bei Tisch einnehmen, als Gesandter meines Reiches mache ich auf den ersten Anspruch". Und so ist es auch mit dem äußerlichen Auftreten, wenn man nicht im Stande ist, es den Kollegen weniger mächtiger Staaten gleichzuthun. Ein Botschaft r bedarf seines Titels wegen kein höheres Gehalt. Er hat, wenn er überhaupt knapp doiict ist, gegen einen Gesandten an einem großen Hofe nur ein Mehrbedürfniß von etwa 1—3000 Thaler, weil es in den meisten Ländern üblich ist, daß der Botschafter große Feste in einem gewisten monarchischen Style gibt, bei denen er von dem Souverän selbst besucht wird, und wo die ihm da durch erwiesene Ehr« ihm größere Dichtung in den Augen der Unterthanen ver schafft. Darum handelt es sich hier aber nicht. Der Grund, aus welchem wir den Titel „Botschafter" gegeben haben, bezieht sich vielmehr auf den Rang der diplo matischen Vertreter unter sich. Es ist da ein Unterschied. Es kommt z. B. vor, daß, wenn der auswärtige Minister mit einem Gesandten in einer verabredeten Konferenz ist, und es wird ein Botschafter gemeldet, der Minister sich alsdann für verpflichtet hält, die Unterredung abzubrechen und den Botschafter zu empfangen. Oder wenn ein Gesandter, d.r vielleicht schon eine Stunde im Vorzimmer gewartet bat, gerade empfangen werden soll, und in dem Moment ein Botschafter angemel det wird, so wird der Botschafter empfangen, und der Gesandte kann noch eine Stunde warten, oder wird an demselben Tage gar nicht empfangen. Man kann sagen, der Gesandte braucht sich das nicht gefallen zu lasten, und ich bin selbst in der Lage gewesen, mir das mit Erfolg abzuwehren (Heiter keit), aber diese Dinge streifen leicht an die Grenze einer persönlichen Spannung, die mit der Sache ©ft in gar keinem Verhältniß steht. Man vermeidet das einfach, indem man den Titel gibt, der mit den Ehrenbezeigungrn, mit denen er verbunden ist, und mit den gesammten Ansprüchen, die damit gegeben werden, eher als ein A-guivalent für Geld, als eine Ersparung angesehen werden kann. In öffentlichen Blättern habe ich viel von den besonderen Privilegien des Botschafters in Bezug ruf seinen Verkehr mit dem Souverän gelesen. Es beruhe das auf einem Jrr- ibum. Der Botschafter als solcher hat mit dem Monarchen nicht leichteren Verkehr e.U jeder Gesandte und er kann in keiner Weise das Recht in Anspruch nehmen, mit dem Monarchen ohne Vermittlung seines Minister? zu verkehren. Deshalb ! ächte ich Sie bitten, meine Herren, das Vorurtheil gegen die Botschafter fallen Aba- v. Haverbeck. Wenn der Reichskanzler uns ausgeführt hat. daß surch die Ernennung eines Gesandten zum Botschafter Ersparniste herbeigeführt werden, so habe ich natürlich Nichts g gen das Institut der Botschafter: und würde demselben auch noch nie im preußischen Abgeordnetenhaus« opponirt haben, wenn der Reichskanzl t seine b utige Theorie schon früher aufgestellt hätte. Daß er die berühmte Anekdote von Friedrich tem Großen in ras Reich der Fabel verweist, wundert mich: mem-s Wissens rft die Geschichte am englischen Hofe pastirk. Als der dortige Preußische Gesandte um Gebaliszulage bat, ui» sich Equipage halten zu können, antwort te lbm der große König: „Gele Er zu Fuß und sage Er, daß hunderttausend Plann hinter ihm inarschiren!" Mir scheint diese Aeußerung durch aus im Sinne Friedrichs, und der Rcichskanzler selbst erkennt sie ja in so weit als richtig an. baß bei gebildeten Nationen wenigstens die äußere Pracht ohne Bedeu tung für die Stelluna der Gesandten ist. Reichskanzler Fürst Bismarck: Ich habe di« Anekdote gleichfalls in dieser Form gehört und früher stets meine Freude daran gehabt, so lange ich nicht selbst Minister des Auswärtigen war (Große Heiterkeit.) Friedrich der Große scheint dabi mehr seine Finanzen, die ihm bekanntlich sehr am Herzen lagen, als lein auswär tiges Amt im Auge gehabt zu haben. Das Einverständniß, m dem ich mich mit dem Vorredner in Bezug auf das Institut der Botschafter befinde, ist mir erfreu lich; nur wünschte ich meine Worte nicht so ausgelegt, als ob Jemand, sobald er Botschafter sei, damit auf jede Gehaltserhöhung verzichte. Aus Rom. (Original - Korresponkenz) — 17. November. Ob es damit Ernst sei oder nicht, wollen wir dahingestellt sein lassen, Thatsache, die wir verbürgen können, ist, daß in letzterer Zeit wirklich zwischen dem päpstlichen Stuhle und der französischen Regierung, resp. Herrn Thiers, Unterhandlungen stattfanden, deren Gegenstand die eventuelle Entfernung Pins des Neunten aus Rom war. Soweit waren die Unterhandlungen bereits gediehen, daß dem Papste das an der spani schen Grenze gelegene Schloß Pan als Residenz zur Disposition gestellt worden und die hiesige Regierung hierüber in konfidentieller Weise unter richtet und über die Haltung interpcllirt wurde, welche sie der eventuellen Abreise des Papstes gegenüber einzunehmen gesonnen wäre. Wir können auf das Bestimmteste versichern, daß die hiesige Regierung antwortete, dasi sie zwar die Abreise des Papstes sehr betrüben, daß sie aber, wenn Pius der Neunte auf seinem Beschlusse, Rom zu verlassen, beharren sollte, gewiß Alles thun werde, um für die Sicherheit und Bequemlichkeit des Papstes zu sorgen. Daß also in den letzten Tagen ganz ernstlich von der Abreise des Papstes nach Pau die Rede war und sogar offen der Tag der Parla ments-Eröffnung, nämlich der 27. d. M., als der Tag der Abreise prokla- mirt wurde, können wir, gestützt auf die authentischsten Informationen, auf das Bestimmteste versichern, ob der Plan aber je zur Ausführung gelangen wird, ist eine andere Frage — deren Entscheidung den aller nächsten Tagen vorbehalten bleibt. Daß Pius IX. selbst sich der Abreise mit allen Kräften widersetzt imd daß ein großer Theil seiner Umgebung, Kardinal Antoneüi an der Spitze, ebenfalls von derselben abräth, ist gewiß, ebenso gewiß ist es aber, daß die Jesuitenpartei, welche seit der famosen Ansprache an d'Harcourt, den Papst mehr denn je überwacht und tyrannisirt, mit aller Entschieden heit auf der Abreise besteht und für dieselbe alle Vorbereitungen trifft. Eines der vielen, elenden Mittel, welche die Jesuitenpartei benützt, um Pius IX. ihrem Willen fügsam zu machen, ist die moralische Tortur, der sie denselben unterwirft, indem sie fortwährend ihm sein nahes Ende und die mit dem Himmel zu haltende Abrechnnng vor Augen hält. Nun ist eS aber ein offenes Geheimniß, daß gerade Pius IX. ein äußerst lebenslustiger Greis ist, der an der baldigen Vertauschung des Diesseits mit dem Jenseits durchaus keinen Gefallen findet, der sich im Gegen theil — rund heraus — sehr vor dem Tode fürchtet, und sehr ungerne von demselben sprechen hört. Auf diese Schwäche spekuliren nun die Jesuiten, indem sie den Papst durch die erwähnte moralische Tortur ihren Werken und ihrem Willen gefügig machen, und da, wie gesagt, der Einfluß der Jcsmten- partei eben jetzt ein größerer denn je ist, so wäre es nicht unmöglich, es mit der so oft angekündigten und bisher stets unterbliebenen Abreise PiuS IX. aus Rom diesmal vielleicht denn doch Ernst werden könnte.

Tagesneuigkeiten. Wien, 18. November. * S«. Majestät der Kai'er bat dem Direktor des slavischen Gymnasiums in Brünn, Karl W i t e k, den Titel eines Schulrathes allergnädigst zu verleihen und die LandeS-Schulinspektoren zweiter Klaffe: Dr. Alois Nowak in Brünn, Josef Webr in Prag, Karl Werner in Prag und Dr. Mathias Wretschko in Graz, zu Lanbes-Schulinspektoren erster Klaffe allergnädigst zu ernennen geruht. * Marschall Mac-Mahon hat einen Urlaub genommen, um sich nach Podiebrad in Böhmen zu den Jagden des Freiherrn v. Sina zu begeben. * Eine polyklinische Anstalt, wie sie in den meisten Universitätsstädten Deutschlands besteht, war bisher in Wien nicht zu Stande gekommen, trotz ver- schievener Anläufe, welche zur Errichtung von Ambulatorien, Bezirksordinations anstalten u. s. w. von verschiedenen meist offiziellen Seiten her gemacht worden sind. Nun hat sich endlich ein« größere Zahl von Universitäts-Dozenten vereinigt, um auf eigene Kosten ein solches Institut in der inneren Stadt zu gründen, daS folgende Zwecke erfüllen soll: 1. Unentgeltliche Ordin ation aus allen Spezialfächern der Medizin durch Fachmänner und für ambulatorische Kranke. 2. Verbindung dieser Ordination mit Vorträgen der Ordinarien über ihre Spezial, fäc&ft. 3. Einführung b<r Studenten in die Praxis durch Ausfenduna derselben zur Beobachtung von armen Kranken, welche zuerst ambulatorisch behandelt, später bettlägerig geworden sind, natürlich unter Aufsicht und Verantwortung des Ordi» «aritts: klinische Berichterstattung und Erörterung der so gewonnenen Beobachtun gen. — Die „W. M. W." bemerkt zu dieser Mittheilung: Wir halten das pro- zektirte Institut nur dann für lebensfähig, wenn die dabei betheiligten Persönlich- Liten'dutch ihren Charakter, ihr wiffenschaftliches Streben und ärztliches Anstands- gefühL Bürgschaft leisten, daß das Institut nicht zu geschäftlichem Treiben und Iieklammächetei mißbraucht wird. Wird die Wahl der Dozenten eine den obigen Bedingungen entsprechende sein, so ist an einem Emporkommen der Institution nicht zu zw«f»l»; wenn aber schmutzige, hinlänglich gekennzeichnete, dem. Humbug hul- Ägend« Elemente zugelassen werden, so ist die Anstalt eine todtgeborne, und die dabei sich betbeiligenhen achtbaren Persönlichkeiten sind in Gefahr, in schlechter Ge» ^ellschakb ihre« guten Ruf einzubüßen. * Außer den bereits genannten Aerzten erhielten noch das französische Mrjlmerungskreuz.an 1870—71 die Herren: Hofrath Prof. v. Dumreicher und Prof. Kqlwar cznv, ferner die in der Ambulance von St. Cloud thätigen Regi- mentsärjte Dr. v. Fillenbaum und Netolitzky, Oberarzt Dr. Donek und «Güttl. endlich die drei Oberärzte Dr. Bauer, Heinz und Ludwig, welche fcanz. Transporte aus Deutschland begleiteten. Baron Mu ndy erhielt außer dem Erinnerungskreuze auch die franz. Militär-Tapferkeitsmedaille für seine PeistiMen auf den Schlachtfeldern von Paris, eine für Nichtkombattanten seltene Auszeichnung. Das dem Baron Mündts angebotene Kommandeurkreuz der Ehren legion hat derselbe, wie verlautet, ausgeschlagen. * Als Bewerber für die Direktorsstelle am Wiedner Spital, haben sich -gemeldet: Primarazt Dr. Lorinser, ferner der vor einigen Jahren pensionirte Irrenhaus-Direktor in Prag Dr. Köstl und Dr. Frisch. * Montag Abend? halb 7 Uhr findet eine Versammlung des deutschen Vereins statt. Das Programm ist folgendes: 1. Mittheilungen des Obmannes; 3. Resolution über den Rücktritt des Grafen B e u st. Berichterstatter Dr. Josef Kopp; 3. Antrag auf eine Petition an beide Häuier des Reichsratbes «egen Minister-Anklage. Berichterstatter Dr. Viktor Cavesius. Die -durch Dr. Kopp beantragte Resolution lautet: „Der deutsche Verein in Wien spricht sein Bedauern darüber aus, daß Graf Neust, besten von den Delegationen, welchen er verantwortlich ist, voll ständig gebilligter Politik Oesterreich die Segnungen des äußeren Friedens und die Freundschaft der mächtigen Nachbarstaaten verdankt, seinen Posten beinahe in demselben Augenblicke verlassen mußte, in welchem er sich durch Abwendung einer dem Deuttchihum und der Verfassung Oesterreichs unmittelbar drohenden Gefahr dankenswertbe Verdienste erworben bat. Er erkennt überbaupt in dem Eintreten von Ministerkrisen, welche nicht durch konstitutionelle, jedem Staatsbürger erkennbare Motive, sondern durch geheimnißvoll wirkende Faktoren veranlaßt weiden, ein bedenkliches Zeichen, baß unser Staatsleben noch immer nicht von jenem konstitutionellen Geiste durch drungen ist, ohne welchen jede Verfassungsform ein todter Buchstabe bleibt." * Bei der gestern Abends beim „großen Zeisig" abgehaltenen Versammlung ches demokratischen Vereins des 7. Bezirks ereignete sich ein höchst bedauerlicher Un- -glücksiall. Der in der Burggaffe Nr. 17 wohnhafte Haus eigenthümer Jos. Heßner stürzte, vom Schlage getroffen, todt zu Boden. * Frau Dal Ein hat b.kanntlich Wien bereits verlassen und arbeitet gegen wärtig in Graz. Ja Folge des von den Vertrauensärzten abgegebenen Gutachten? -wurde ihr, wie die „W. M. W." berichtet, die Konzession der freien Praxis hier «ieder entzogen. * Ein äußerst verwegner Einbruchsdiebstahl wurde in der verflossenen Nacht 4n der Wohnung des Honorar-Konzipisten am a. h. Hoflager, des Herrn Ko'oman Jasztrabszki de Ressege, am Getreidemarkt Nr. 15, ausgeführt. Der Genannte chatte vor 14 Tagen den 18jährigen Anton Drotsda als Bedienten aufgenommen, -welcher in der Nacht mittelst des Originalschlüssels eine im Zimmer besindliche Wertheim'sche Kasse öffnete und aus derselben 900 fl. in Banknoten und Pretiosen -im Werthe von über 2000 fl. entwendete und .damit das Weite suchte. Die That wurde erst heute Morgens entdeckt und sofort das Polizeikommiffariat in Maria- chilf hievon verständigt. Unter den entwendeten Pretiosen befindet sich ein antiker .goldener Ring mit 12 Brillanten besetzt und eine lange Halskette, 22 Dukaten -schwer. welcher in Thätlichkeiten ausartete. Sie hätten sich «n Zimmer herumgebalgt und da sei der Verunglückte zu Boden gefallen, auf den Beide noch losgeschlagn haben, bis er endlich bewußtlos wurde. Hierauf hätten sie den todten Körper in den Garten geschleppt und dort liegen gelassen. Eine Absicht, daß si» den Marschalek lödten wollten, leugneten Beide. Die weiteren Erhebungen hinsichtlich des Verhältnisses, in welchem der Schwiegersohn zu dem Ermordeten gestanden war, brachten jedoch neue schwere Beschuldigungen an den Tag. Marschalek war ein Trunkenbold und für seine Verwandten eine wahre Plage, da er auch zu Ex- z-ssen geneigt, den Familienfrieden störte. Sein Schwiegersohn hatte sich schon öfters drohend gegen ihn geäußert und es liegt die Wahrscheinlichkeit nahe, daß er sich mtt seinem Genossenlverabredet hatte, den Marschalek aus dem Wege zu räumen, um von dieser Plage befreit zu sein. Diese Ansicht scheint auch von Seite des Gerichtes acceptftt worden zu sein, welches die beiden Verdächtigen ln Haft behielt und gegen dieselben die Anklage wegen Verbrechens des Mordes erhob. Man siebt diesem Prozesse mit Spannung entgegen. * In einer Grotzwardeiner Familie war unlängst Theegesellschaft. Das schöne HauSfräulein kredenzte selbst den Trank. „Wie finden Sie unseren Thee?" fragte sie einen ihrer Verehrer, der mit der ersten Taffe beglückt worden war, «nickt wahr, er ist vorzüglich?" Der junge Mann wagte nicht zu widersprechen, brockte aber sein Lob mit etwas saurer Miene vor. Das Fräulein bemerkt, daß auch die übrigen, an die Reihe kommenden Gäste sich der edlen Blume des Thees gegenüber sehr reservirt verhalten. Endttch kostet sie selbst und stürzt dann in die Kücke ab. um bald darauf mit bellem Lachen zurückzukehren. Die Köchin hatte sich in der Büchse vergriffen und so war den Gästen ein Aufguß, statt von chinesischem Thee — von türkischem Tabak vorgesetzt worden. * Aus den Rheinländer» schreibt man der „Magdb. Ztg": Es gibt hier kein größeres Werk, keine Zeche, auf welcher nicht wegen Mangels an Waggons und Kohlen die Arbeit wenigstens theilweife eingestellt ist. Bei gesteigertem Preise aller Lebensmittel tritt auch noch ein Verlust an Arbeitsverdienst ein. Es fehlt so mit nicht an den Bedingungen eines Nothstandes, der nach und nach ganz uner träglich zu werden droht. Zu d-n Gruben, welch« die Förderung haben einstellen müffen, gehört unter anderen auch die Zeche „Vereinigte Germania" bei Marten. Die Bergleute der letzteren haben sich deshalb telegraphisch mit der nachstehenden Bitte an den Fürsten v. Bismarck gewendet: An den Reichskanzler Fürsten Bismarck Berlin. Seit dem 1. Norember stockt der Güterverkehr gänzlich. In Folge dessen können wir unsere Kohlen nicht mehr aus der Grude bekommen, wir ver dienen nichts mehr, und unser Leben ist gefährdet, da durch die vielen in der Grube lagernden Kohlen der Wetterzug gehemmt ist und sich die Betriebe voll schlagender W tter stellen. Heute bat unsere Direktion uns gar nicht anfahren lassen. Wir verdienen also nichts und das ist sehr hart für den Arbeiter in dieser tbeueren Zeit. Lieber Fürst Bismarck! Wir haben Ihnen vor einem Jahre ge holfen und nun helfen S e auch ein Mal. daß wir wieder an den Verdienst kommen. Für die wegen Wagenmangel feiernden 714 Bergleute 'der Zeche „Vereinigte Germania" Fritz Sonntag. Der Reichskanzler muß, er wird helfen! * Aus Marienburg, 15. November, wird berichtet: Wir haben Wiedel ein entsetzliches V rbrechen zu registriren. Der Gutsbesitzer Ludwig Peters in Lieffau bei Dirtckau, ein stiller, ruhiger Mann, der in weiten Kreisen der Provinz gekannt ist, ging vergangenen Sonntag Nachmittag auf seinen Ausbau hart an der Marienburg-Dirschauer Cbausiee, um die Martini-Abrechnungen mit seinen Dienstleuten zu halten, und dem Schäfer zu kündigen. Schon auf dem Hofe wurde ihm bedeutet, er möchte sich doch heute vor dem Schäfer in Acht nehmen, doch unbekümmert trat er ihm entgegen, unterhielt sich über die Schäferei und sagt» ihm, da derselbe betrunken schien, ec möge ruhig nach Hause geben, er (Peters) würde die. Schafe füttern. Kaum waren diese Worte gesprochen, hetzte der Schäfer seine beiden Hunde gegen seinen Brodherrn, welche diesem das Bein zerfetzten und in dem Augenblicke, als Pet rs sich bückte, um die Bestien abzuwehren, drang b'it Mordstahl dreimal in seinen Körper. Der erste Stich ging in die Brust und in- Herz, der zweite in den Unterleib, der dritte über das rechte Auge. Zehn Minuten nach der schrecklichen That verschied Peters, nur noch zwei Worte flüsternd: „Meine Frau!" Es waren noch sechs Arbeiter in der Nähe, welch« nicht wagten, de» Mörder zu ergreifen, so daß er nach vollbrachter That das Weite suchen konnte. Bis j tzt bat man keine Spur von ihm. * Vor etwa sechs Wochen theilten wir mit, daß ein 21jähriger Bursche im V-rdachte stehe, eine große Reihe von Brandstiftungen mit dem einzigen Zweckt verübt zu haben, um sich die kleine Belohnung zu sichern, welche die Londoner Feuer wehr dem Ueberbringer rer ersten Kunde von einem Brandunglück zu zahle» pflegt. Bei dem letzten Experiment dieser Art verdiente er 2 Sch. 6 P., während die ver schiedenen Feuer-Versicherungsgesellschaften den angerichteten Schaden mit 9000 Pfd. — also dem 72 OOOfmten — vergüten mußten. Anfänglich hielt man die Be hauptungen der Feuerwehr für unmöglick, seither aber haben die Forschungen der Geheimpolizei herausgestellt, daß er nicht weniger als 114 Brandstiftungen inner» halb der letzten beiden Jahre, und zwar in London allein, verübt hat. Der Ange klagte leugnet hartnäckig, aber bereits liegen die gravirendsten Zeugenaussagen gegen bn vor: und nach einigen formellen Stadien, welche die Voruntersuchung noch durchzumachen hat. wird er vor das Schwurgericht verwiesen werden. Aus dem Geriehtssaale. Graz, 17. November. — (Orig.-kBer.s (Krida projeß Morocutti.) — (Schluß.) Johann Paul Morocutti. aus Hermagor in Kärnten gebürtig, gibt in seinem Verhöre an. daß die große Baisse im Jahre 1369, bei welcher er für seine Parteien Deckung leisten mußte, der eigentliche Grund zu seiner Zahlungsunfäbigkeit sei. Weiters gibt der Kridatar als Grund seiner Insolvenz an, deß ec bei Konkursen große Verluste erlitten, und daß mehrere Gläubger au! ein Gerücht hin. ihre Forderungen an ihn sofort realisirten. Vors. Wußten Sie, daß Sie passiv waren? — Ang. Ich war bei Ecösf- nung des Konkurses selbst noch aktiv und nur die unglückseligen exekutiven Verkäufe mußten mich später passiv macken Vo rs. Ein Herr Pittner bat ihre Bücber geprüft und gesunden, daß Sie passiv seien. — Aug. Ich weiß nicht, wie so Herr Pittner zu diesem Schluffe kam. Vors. Was wollten Sie Herrn Pittner für eine Anstellung geben? — Ang. Als Geschäftsleiter mit Geschäftsantheil insolange als mein Geschäft mit der Unionbank nicht abgeschlossen sei. Vors. Was war das für ein Geschäft? — Ang. Die Unionbank wollte mein Geschäft unter guten Bedingungen ablösen. Vors. Warum haben Sie roch den Konkurs eröffnet? — Ang. Weil Pittner überall erzählte, ich sei passiv und Herr Gerbitz mir dies mittheilte, da ging ich zu Dr. Rechbauer und eröffnete den Konkurs,' da, nachdem man mich für passiv hielt, es ohnehin umsonst, war weiter zu arbeiten. Vors. Was ist also nach Ihrer Ansicht der Grund Ihrer Insolvenz? — Ang. Der deulsch-französische Krieg eigentlich: wäre dieser nicht ausgebrochen, ich hätte besser meine Geschäfte realisiren können. Ich habe zudem Alles bei den Wiener Banken gedeckt, zum Beweise mußten diese später Geld an mich zurück schicken. Der Hauptgrund liegt auch, wie schon erwähnt, an den schlechten Reali- sirungen meiner Realitäten, Weine u. s. w. durch die Masse. Vertheidiger Dr. Telegraphische Depeschen. Prag, 18.Novemb.

Die demokratische Partei muß ihre Befähigung zur Führung der Geschäfte beweisen, sie muß die Schulen von der Kirche trennen; der Unterricht durch Laien ist durch das von der Kirche gegen die modernen Freiheiten geschleuderte Anathema zur Nothwendigkeit gemacht. Die Republik ist eine Nothwendigkeit geworden, sie ist nicht be droht. aber die Nationalversammlung, die nicht den Willen des Landes vertritt, darf nicht alle Reformen vertagen.

Article: Bernd Kessens (* 9. März 1948 in Bunnen, Stadt Löningen, Landkreis Cloppenburg) ist ein deutscher Schriftsteller.

Leben und Wirken 

Kessens studierte in Münster Germanistik und Geographie und war von 1974 bis 2001 Lehrer am Gymnasium in Damme, wo er lebt. Seit 1989 veröffentlichte er mehrere Romane mit historischen und modernen Themen. Kessens war bis Juli 2008 Fraktionsvorsitzender der SPD im Kreistag Vechta; sein Mandat als Kreistagsabgeordneter nahm er bis 2016 wahr. 

Zu den historischen Themen, die Kessens in seinen Romanen behandelt, gehört die Aufarbeitung der Beziehungen zwischen den Grundherren, Bauern und landlosen Heuerleuten in der ersten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts. Zu Kessens' modernen Themen in seinen Romanen gehört die psychologisch orientierte Charakterologie. Hier werden typische Charakterstrukturen außergewöhnlicher Menschen untersucht, um Affinitäten in Gefühls-, Denk- und Verhaltensmustern herauszukristallisieren.

Kessens ist auch Autor von Theaterstücken, die jeweils an seinem Wohnort Damme uraufgeführt wurden: Die Räuber vom Mordkuhlenberg (2004/2005), Die weiße Frau von der Dersaburg (2006/2007) über Widukind und die Sachsen im Umkreis der Dersaburg, Wunderheiler wider Willen (2008/2009), Glückauf – eine unvergessene Liebe. Ein Bergwerksdrama (2010/2011), das Auswandererdrama Amerika und das große Glück (2012), das Schauspiel Im Westen geht die Sonne auf (2013) – Theaterstück über das Schicksal einer Aussiedlerfamilie aus Kasachstan –, die Komödie Ist der Winter bestechlich? (2015) – ein Stück über Korruption und Bestechung – sowie Romeo und Julia in den Dammer Bergen, eine vor der Dammer Pfarrkirche St. Viktor aufgeführte Bearbeitung von Shakespeares Tragödie Romeo und Julia (2017), das Drama "Vom Jungen, der Hitlers Pläne durchkreuzte", das im Rahmen der Dammer Domfestspiele im September 2022 aufgeführt wurde. Das Theaterstück behandelt den Kreuzkampf 1936, bei dem die Katholiken im Oldenburger Münsterland die nationalsozialistische Regierung im Freistaat Oldenburg unter Druck setzen konnten, den sog. Kreuzerlass zurückzunehmen. Unter Kreuzerlass versteht man vorrangig die Entfernung von Kreuzen und Lutherbildern aus den Schulen. Die Zahl der Besucher lag pro Stück zwischen 2600 und 4000. 

Die wichtigsten Romane sind Rabenfluch, Freiheit und gebratener Speck, und an den Füßen eine goldene Uhr, Getanzte Liebe Flamenco (eine Bearbeitung von Goethes Die Leiden des jungen Werthers) sowie Die Angst des Stierkämpfers vor der Spitze des Horns.

Aktenstücke zu den Verhandlungen des Reichstages 1887/88. Reichstag. Aktenstück Nr. W5. vierzehnter Bericht der Kommission für die Petitionen.) 835 Nr. 195. Vierzehnter Bericht der Kommission für -ie Petitionen. Berichterstatter: Abgeordneter Parey.1Journal II. Nr. 11 953. Die in den staatlichen Eisenbahn-Werkstätten beschäftig­ ten Petenten führen aus, sie seien durch ein Statut vom Jahre 1856 gezwungen worden, der Krankenkasse der Schlosser-, Sporer-, Büchsen- und Windenmacher- und der Feilenhauer-Gesellen beizutreten. Unabhängig hiervon sei ihnen aber auch die Verpflichtung auferlegt worden, der für die Arbeiter der Eisenbahn-Werkstätten errichteten Kranken- und Unterstützungskasse beizutreten. Für die, erstere dieser beiden Zwangskassen sei auf Grund des Ge­ setzes vom 15. Juni 1883 ein neues Statut erlassen wor­ den, in dessen §. 1 die Bestimmung enthalten sei: „Die Kasse besteht für die vorbezeichneten Gewerbe, mit Ausnahme derjenigen derselben angehörigen Betriebe, für welche eine Betriebs-)Fabrik-sKranken- kasse errichtet ist." Auf Grund dieser letzteren Vorschrift und unter Be­ zugnahme aus den §. 27 des Krankenkassengesetzes hat der Magistrat zu Breslau 1886 (mithin drei Jahre nach der Er­ richtung des neuen Statuts) die Namen der Petenten in der Liste der Mitglieder der Ortskrankenkasse gestrichen. Hierdurch fühlen sich die Petenten in ihren Rechten ver­ letzt. Sie behaupten, es sei ihnen bei der Berathung des neuen Statuts ausdrücklich erklärt worden, daß ihre Mit­ gliedschaft bei der Ortskrankenkasse ein durch die Verpflich­ tung des Beitritts erworbenes Recht sei, welches den Be­ theiligten durch das Reichsgesetz vom 15. Juni 1883 nicht geschmälert werden könne. Auch für die Eisenbahnwerk- stätten-Krankenkasse sei ein neues Statut aufgestellt worden. Auch diese Kasse sei eine Zwangskasse; es sei jedoch den­ jenigen Personen, welche vermöge ihrer Beschäftigung zum Beitritt sowohl berechtigt als verpflichtet seien, freigestellt, auf ihren Antrag von der Theilnahme an der Eisen­ bahnwerkstätten - Krankenkasse freizubleiben, wenn sie nachweislich Mitglieder einer den Bestimmungen des Ge­ setzes vom 15. Juni 1883 entsprechenden Krankenkasse seien. Von dieser Befugniß hätten die Petenten jedoch keinen Ge­ brauch gemacht, weil es in ihrem Interesse gelegen habe, beiden Kassen auch weiter anzugehören. Würden da­ gegen diejenigen Personen, welche vor Erlaß des Kranken­ versicherungsgesetzes der Eisenbahnwerkstätten-Krankenkasse und der Ortskrankenkasse angehörten, nunmehr, nachdem sie die Beiträge in vielen Fällen dreißig und noch mehr Jahre entrichtet hätten, des Anrechtes auf weitere Zugehörigkeit zu der Ortskrankenkasse für verlustig erklärt, so würde aus dem Gesetz nicht ein Vortheil, sondern umgekehrt der schwere Nachtheil gerade für die besseren Arbeiter, welche auf zwei­ fache, aber so erst ausreichende Weise für die Fälle der Krankheit für sich und ihre Angehörigen schon vor Erlaß des Gesetzes gesorgt hätten, erwachsen, daß die von ihnen nicht ohne verhältnißmäßig erhebliche Opfer für eine lange Reihe von Jahren zur Ortskrankenkasse entrichteten Beiträge für immer verloren seien. In diesem Sinne haben sich die Petenten auch an den Herrn Reichskanzler in dessen Eigenschaft als Minister für Handel und Gewerbe gewendet, sie sind aber durch die Verfügung des Handelsministers vom 5. Januar er. abschlägig beschieden worden, und zwar lediglich unter Hinweis auf den H. 1 des Statuts. Dazu ist noch bemerkt, die weitere Frage, ob etwaige Beschlüsse der Kassenvertretungen, welche auf eine Abänderung der statutarischen Vorschriften im Sinne der gestellten Anträge abzielen, zu genehmigen seien, entziehe sich der ministeriellen Entscheidung, da über die­ selben nach den bestehenden gesetzlichen Bestimmungen in Preußen der Bezirksausschuß zu befinden habe, gegen dessen Entscheidung allein das Rechtsmittel der Berufung an das Oberverwaltungsgericht zugelassen sei. (§. 24 des Kranken­ versicherungsgesetzes, Nr. 38, 39 der preußischen Ausfüh­ rungsanweisung vom 26. November 1883.) Die Petenten stellen nunmehr den Antrag: der Reichstag wolle die Königliche Staatsregierung auffordern, durch geeignet erscheinende Verfügung den Vorstand der Breslauer Ortskrankenkasse zu ihrer Wiederaufnahme als vollberechtigte Mitglieder der Kasse zu veranlassen. Unter Betheiligung eines Regierungs-Kommissars, des Geheimen Oberregierungsraths Herrn Lohmann, hat die Petitionskommission am 29. Februar er. über diese Ange­ legenheit verhandelt. Die beiden Referenten waren über­ einstimmend der Ansicht, es stehe gesetzlich nichts entgegen, daß Jemand gleichzeitig zweien Kassen angehöre; das Gegentheil ergebesich nicht aus dem §. 27 des Gesetzes vom 15.Juni 1883, auf welchen sich auch der Herr Minister in seinem oben gedachten abschlägigen Bescheide nicht berufen habe. Auch der §. 1 des Statuts von 1884 lasse die Deutung zu, daß Jemand Mitglied der Ortskrankenkasse sein könne, ohne deshalb aus der Betriebs- (Fabrik-) Krankenkasse ausscheiden zu müssen, und umgekehrt. Zwar bestehe die Befugniß zu einem der­ artigen Ausscheiden, aber nicht die Verpflichtung zu demselben. Möge aber auch das Statut im Sinne des Magistrats aus­ gelegt werden, so bleibe doch immer noch der Grundsatz bestehen, daß ein behördliches Statut niemals geeignet sei, wohl erworbene Rechte ohne Entschädigung aufzuheben. Die Petenten seien seit langen Jahren durch Gesetz genöthigt worden, Beiträge zu beiden Zwangskassen zu leisten, und dadurch hätten sie auch bestimmte Rechte auf Krankenver­ sicherungsgelder aus diesen Kassen erworben. Seitens der Regierungsvertretung wurde hiergegen Folgendes eingewendet: Schon vor dem Erlaß des Kranken­ versicherungsgesetzes habe kein Zwang bestanden, zwei Kassen anzugehören, was sich aus §. 141a Absatz 2 und Artikel 2 des Gesetzes vom 8. April 1876 (Reichs-Gesetzbl. S. 134) ergebe. Daselbst heißt es: „Von der Pflicht, einer solchen Hülfskasse beizutreten oder fernerhin anzugehören, werden diejenigen befreit, welche die Betheiligung an einer anderen eingeschriebenen Hülfskasse nachweisen." Ferner bemerkt der Herr Regierungskommissar: der §. 1 des Orts­ krankenkassenstatuts von 1884 entspreche dem §. 19 Absatz 2 des Krankenversicherungsgesetzes, welcher lautet: „die in diesen Gewerbszweigen und Betriebsarten beschäftigten Personen werden, soweit sie versicherungspflichtig sind, mit dem Tage, an welchem sie in die Beschäftigung eintreten, Mitglieder der Kasse, soweit sie nicht nachweislich einer der übrigen in §. 4 be­ nannten Kassen angehören." Hiernach entspreche die Streichung der Petenten aus der Liste der Kassenmitglieder dem §. 1 des Kassenstatuts und dem §. 27 des Gesetzes, weil mit dem Zeitpunkte, mit welchem das neue Statut in Kraft getreten sei, die Beschäftigung in Eisenbahnwerkstätten aus der Reihe derjenigen Beschäftigungen ausgeschieden sei, für 105» Reichstag.

Rauhweizen das gleiche Gewicht (715 Gramm per Liter) wie der gute Weizen haben, Die Frage, ob Rauhweizen von der Lieferung ausgeschlossen werden solle, sei mehrfach erörtert worden. Man habe davon absehen müssen, da größere Konsumentenkreise, außer in Süddeutschland, z. B. in Sachsen und Hannover, den Rauhweizen gebrauchen und bei ihren Einkäufen auf den Berliner Markt ange­ wiesen seien. Uebrigens würden in Berlin 1887 nicht mehr als 5000 Tonnen Rauhweizen gehandelt und ein verhält- nißmäßig kleines Quantum könne auf die Preisbildung des Weizens bei der großen deutschen Produktion keine Ein­ wirkung üben. Im Frühjahrstermin 1887 sei der Unterschied zwischen gutem und Rauhweizen6—9 Mark per Tonne gewesen. Die Kommission gelangte in ihrer Mehrheit zu der Auf­ fassung, daß bei der eminenten Bedeutung und gewaltigen Macht der Berliner Börse, welche auf den Börsenverkehr der sämmtlichen anderen Börsen Deutschlands ausschlaggebend wirkte, auch der Reichstag alle Veranlassung habe, sich mit der so wichtigen Frage der Ordnung des Börsenwesens, als eines nicht blos für den Handel, sondern auch für Produktion und Konsumtion wichtigen In­ stitutes zu beschäftigen. Erst von dem Resultate der etwa anzustellenden Enqueten sei es abhängig zu machen, ob im Wege der Reform des Handelsgesetzbuches, also im Wege der Reichsgesetzgebung oder im Wege der Verordnungen durch die Handelsminister der Einzelstaaten, kraft ihres Aufsichtsrechts und behufs Wahrung der Inter­ essen aller Erwerbskreise/ vorgegangen werden solle. Sie hielt daher den Reichstag für kompetent, in die Er­ örterung der Frage einzutreten. Obgleich sich noch mehrere Redner zum Wort gemeldet hatten, wurde der Antrag auf Schluß der Diskussion an­ genommen. Der Kommission lagen die Anträge vor: „die Petition für ungeeignet zur Be­ rathung im Plenum zu erklären; und ein Gegenantrag:1, Der Reichstag wolle beschließen:1. dem Plenum mittelst schriftlichen Berichtes zu empfehlen, „die Petition dem Herrn Reichskanzler zur Erwägung zu überweisen, ob aus Anlaß der in der Petition so wie auch vielfach in der Presse zur Sprache ge­ brachten Mißstände eine Enquete über die Zustände der einheimischen Börsen vorzunehmen sei, und eventuell, ob eine reichsgesetzliche Regelung der Materie sich empfehlen möchte." Der zuletzt gedachte Antrag gelangte zunächst zur Abstimmung und wurde mit 10 gegen 6 Stim­ men angenommen, nachdem drei Mitglieder sich entfernt und ein Mitglied sich der Abstimmung enthalten hatte.

Der verkaufte Weizen respektive Roggen, Hafer muß dem Käufer in Posten von 50 Tonnen (siehe §. 5) gegen Zug um Zug zu leistende baare Zahlung des bedungenen Preises effektiv geliefert werden, und zwar nach des Verkäufers Wahl vom Kahne oder vom Boden, oder zum Theil vom Kahne und zum Theil vom Bodm, doch höchstens in zwei getrennten, aber gleichzeitig anzu­ kündigenden Partien. §. 2. Der Verkäufer ist verpflichtet, die Lieferung des verkauften Weizens durch Uebergabe eines Kündigungs­ scheins an der Börse bis 12^ Uhr Mittags an einem ihm beliebigen Werkeltage innerhalb der obigen Frist dem Käufer anzukündigen. Endet die Lieferungsfrist an einem Feiertage, so muß die Ankündigung spätestens am vorhergehenden Werkeltage geschehen. — Die beiden jüdischen Neujahrstage und der jüdische Versöhnungstag werden hierbei, wie überall in diesem Vertrage, als Feiertage gerechnet. Beide Theile sind an die Beobachtung des an der Börse aushängenden Kündigungsreglements gebunden. §. 3. Der Kündigungsschein muß enthalten: Bei Lieferungen vom Kahne: das Datum der Kündigung, den Namen des Schiffers, der auch in das an der hiesigen Börse ausgelegte Kahnregister eingetragen sein muß, die Nummer und den Standort des Kahnes, der dem Schiffer von dem Polizei-Schiffahrts-Bureau als Auslade- oder Anlegeort angewiesen ist, und an dem er zur Zeit der Besichtigung seitens des Empfängers bereits angekommen sein muß, den Ort der Abladung und das Quantum der Ladung; und bei Lieferungen vom Boden: das Datum der Kündigung, sowie genaue Bezeichnung der Partie Weizen nach Lagerraum und Quantum. Der Aussteller hat bei Ausreichung ein Duplikat des Kündigungsscheins der Kündigungs-Registratur zu übergeben. ß. 4. Entspricht die Kündigung nicht den vorstehen­ den Bestimmungen, so wird sie als nicht erfolgt angesehen, und hat der Ankündiger alsdann alle sich daraus ergeben­ den Nachtheile zu tragen. Hat bei Lieferungen vom Kahn der Schiffer den Standort innerhalb des Weichbildes auf Anordnung der Polizeibehörde verändern müssen, so ist dies kein Grund, die Kündigung für ungültig zu er­ klären. §. 5. Ergiebt sich bei der Abnahme einer gekündig­ ten Partie von 50 Tonnen (ek. tz. 1) ein Minus bis zu ^ 20-2 Tonnen, so wird dasselbe zum Durchschnittspreise, wie dieser für den laufenden Termin am Tage der Abnahme amtlich festgestellt ist, regulirt.

Aktenstück Nr. 87. (Vierter Bericht der Kommission für die Petitionen.) einer Auszählung führte, welche die Beschlußunfähigkeit des Hauses ergab. In der laufenden Session ist von dem Vorstande des Verbandes deutscher Schlosserinnungen mittels Eingabe vom 21. November 1887 die frühere Petition ohne weitere Aen­ derung überreicht, als daß als dasjenige Gesetz, in welches man die für Jnnungsmeister verlangte ausschließliche Gewerbe- befugniß eingeschaltet zusehenwünscht, dertz.369R.-St.-G.-B. bezeichnet wird, so daß der Hauptantrag nunmehr lautet: der Reichstag wolle im Interesse der öffentlichen Sicherheit den §. 369 Absatz 1 R.-St.-G.-B. da­ hin abändern, daß der Verkauf von Schlüsseln, das Einpassen derselben und das Oeffnen von Schlössern ausschließlich in die Hand von Schlossern gelegt werde, welche durch Zugehörigkeit zu einer Innung Gewähr gegen Mißbräuche bieten. Für den Fall, daß dem Reichstage solche Maßregel zur Zeit noch nicht ausführbar erscheinen sollte, beantragt die Petition: wenigstens den Uebelstand zu beseitigen, daß auf Grund des §, 369 Nr. 1 Schlosser mit schwerer Strafe bedroht seien für Handlungen, die von Nichtschlossern täglich straflos vorgenommen würden, was sich sehr einfach dadurch werde erreichen lassen, daß man an genannter Stelle die Eingangsworte „Schlosser, welche", durch das Wort „Wer" er­ setze. Die Kommission hat die Petition in der Sitzung vom 20. d. M. verhandelt, dabei auch dem Unterzeichner der­ selben, Schlossermeister Remmert, auf dessen Wunsch Ge­ legenheit gegeben, unter Vorzeigung einer Anzahl von Schlüsseln und Schlössern mündlich darzulegen, wie selbst zu kunstvoll gearbeiteten Schlössern passende Schlüssel ledig­ lich unter Angabe des dem Schlosse eingepreßten Buch­ stabens oder Zeichens im Handel zu kaufen seien. Der zugezogene Regierungskommissar, Geh. Ober- Regierungsrath und vortragende Rath im Reichs-Justizamt HerrDeegen, hat ausBesragenseine in den früheren Sessionen gegebenen Erklärungen mit dem Hinzufügen wiederholt, daß auch in der Zwischenzeit weder darüber, in welchem Um­ fange die in Frage stehenden Arbeiten und Verkäufe von anderen Personen, als von Schlossern vorgenommen würden, noch darüber, ob und in welchem Maße auf diesen Um­ stand die zur öffentlichen Kunde gelangten Fälle von Ein­ bruchsdiebstählen zurückzuführen seien, Ermittelungen an­ gestellt oder auf anderem Wege Material für die Beurtheilung gewonnen sei. Als seine persönliche Auffassung sprach der gedachte Regierungskommissar die Ansicht aus, daß eine irgendwie in Betracht kommende Erleichterung der Einbruchsdiebstähle in den von den Petenten hervorgehobenen Umständen aus dem Grunde nicht zu finden sein dürfe, weil in den in früherer Zeit zu seiner Kenntniß gelangten Fällen die Diebe die von ihnen benutzten Dietriche und Nachschlüssel entweder selbst angeferügt oder von Anderen hätten an­ fertigen lassen. In der Kommission war man einstimmig der Ansicht, daß die Fassung des §. 369 R.-St.-G.-B., welche sich aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach daraus erkläre, daß zur Zeit des Erlasses desselben die in Frage stehenden Arbeiten that­ sächlich nur von Schlossern ausgeführt seien, nach Lage der jetzigen Verhältnisse der Fabrikation und des Geschäfts­ verkehrs einerseits als ausreichender Schutz gegen die dabei ins Auge gefaßte Gefährdung des Eigenthums nicht mehr anzusehen sei, und andererseits eine den Schlossern zur Be­ schwerde gereichende Einseitigkeit darstelle, auf deren Be­ seitigung durch eine entsprechende Aenderung des Straf­ gesetzbuches Bedacht genommen werden müsse. Die Meinungsverschiedenheit beschränkte sich in dieserffMch- tung lediglich auf die Frage, ob die hervorgetretenen Uebelstände in dem Maße erheblich seien, daß ein so­ fortiges gesetzgeberisches Eingreifen geboten erscheine, oder ob man die Regelung für eine umfassendere Revision des Strafgesetzbuches vorbehalten dürfe. Im Gegensätze zu der bezüglich dieses Punktes vor­ handenen Uebereinstimmung fand der von den Petenten in erster Linie gestellte Antrag, die Anfertigung der mehr­ gedachten Arbeiten ausschließlich Jnnungsschlossern zu über­ tragen, nur bei einer Minderzahl der Kommissionsmitglieder Vertretung, während seitens der Mehrheit geltend gemacht wurde, daß auch bei den größten Sympathien für die in neuerer Zeit hervorgetretenen Jnnungsbestrebungen die be­ antragte Maßregel offenbar zu weit gehe und jedenfalls so lange nicht gerechtfertigt sei, als man gegen die ange­ regten Uebelstände auf andere Weise Abhülfe schaffen könne. Seitens eines Mitgliedes der Mehrheit wurde so­ gar die Ansicht aufgestellt, daß der Zweck der Peütion aus­ schließlich darauf gerichtet sei, das Interesse der Innungen dadurch zu fördern, daß man den außerhalb der Innungen stehenden Schlossern gewisse Arbeiten untersage, während das angebliche öffentliche Interesse lediglich als Deckmantel dieser eigennützigen Bestrebungen benutzt werde. Bei der Abstimmung wurde der Antrag: dem Reichstage zu empfehlen, den Hauptantrag der Petition dem Herrn Reichskanzler zur Kenntniß­ nahme zu überweisen, mit 14 gegen 4 Stimmen abgelehnt und mit 13 gegen 5 Sümmen beschlossen: beim Reichstage zu beantragen, über den Haupt­ antrag der Peütion zur Tagesordnung überzu­ gehen. Hinsichtlich des noch verbleibenden zweiten Theiles des Petitionsantrages schlug eines derjenigen Mitglieder, welche die Abänderung des §. 369 eit. nicht im Wege eines be­ sonderen Gesetzes, sondern bei Gelegenheit einer Revision des Strafgesetzbuches befürworteten, zur Vermittelung zwischen den entgegenstehenden Anträgen, welche dahin gingen, dem Reichstage zu empfehlen, einerseits: die Petition dem Herrn Reichskanzler zur Berück­ sichtigung zu überweisen, und andererseits: die Petition dem Herrn Reichskanzler zur Berück­ sichtigung bei einer demnächstigen Revision des Strafgesetzbuches zu überweisen, als Vermittelung folgende Fassung vor: die Peütion dem Herrn Reichskanzler zur Berück­ sichtigung bei einer in Aussicht zu nehmenden Re­ vision des Strafgesetzbuches zu überweisen, wobei darauf hingewiesen wurde, daß eine baldigst um­ fassende Revision ohnehin aus anderen Gründen dringend wünschenswerth sei. Bei der Abstimmung wurde der Antrag: die Peütion dem Herrn Reichskanzler zur Berück­ sichtigung zu überweisen, mit 12 gegen 6 Stimmen abgelehnt und darauf der be­ zeichnete Vermittelungsantrag mit 11 gegen 7 Sümmen an­ genommen, wodurch der noch verbleibende beschränktere An­ trag erledigt war. Hiernach beantragt die Kommission: der Reichstag wolle beschließen: 1. über die Petition des Vorstandes des Verbandes deutscher Schlosser-Innungen (Journ. II. 13), soweit (dieselbe darauf gerichtet ist, durch gesetzliche Bestimmung den Verkauf von Schlüsseln, das Ein­ passen derselben und das Oeffnen von Reichstag. Aktenstück Nr. 138. (Bericht der neunten Kommission.) 603 Befördemngen vornehmen müssen; tüchtige Richter würden nicht so, wie sie es verdienten, zur Anerkennung gelangen. Die stille Gegenwart der Vorgesetzten und Revisoren gefährde nicht die Unabhängigkeit der Rechtsprechung; der Gesetzgeber müsse den Richtern so viel Muth und Selbständigkeit zu­ trauen, daß sie sich durch dieselbe in ihrem Votum nicht beeinflussen lassen würden. Es wurde erwidert: Der Antrag enthalte keinen neuen Gedanken, sondem stehe auf dem Boden der preußischen Verordnung vom 3. Januar 1849, welche ausdrücklich aus­ gesprochen habe, daß die Berathung des Gerichts ohne Beisein anderer Personen erfolge. Auch die Jnstizgesetz- kommission habe durch ihren ursprünglichen Beschluß un­ zweifelhaft denselben Grundsatz aufstellen wollen. Auch der spätere Beschluß, der gegenwärtig geltendes Recht sei, habe in Wirklichkeit denselben Sinn gehabt; es handle sich jetzt nur darum, diesen Sinn gegenüber den in der Praxis bei der Auslegung entstandenen Zweifeln festzustellen. Veranlassung za einer solchen Feststellung habe die Vorlage selbst geboten, dadurch, daß sie die Frage, ob und in welchem Umfange die Dienstaufsicht zur An­ wesenheit bei den nichtöffentlichen Gerichtsverhandlungen berechtige, aus eigenem Antriebe in dieses Gesetz hinein­ gezogen habe. Die Beantwortung der Frage gehöre also wohl in dieses Gesetz. Sie solle beantwortet werden in demselben Sinne, in welchem die preußische Gesetzgebung und in welchem die Justizgesetzkommission sie beantwortet habe. Damals habe man sich nicht davon zu überzeugen vermocht, daß das Interesse der Justizverwaltung die Gegenwart des Oberlandesgerichtspräsidenten bei den Be­ rathungen der seiner Dienstaufsicht unterstehenden Gerichts­ kollegien erheische; auch die jetzt dafür vorgebrachten Gründe seien nicht überzeugend. Dem Aufsichtsbeamten ständen noch andere Wege offen, um sich über die Befähigung der Richter zur Bekleidung höherer Stellen zu informiren; wisse er diese nicht zu benutzen, so würden auch die Beobach­ tungen, welche er als gelegentlicher Zuhörer bei der Be­ rathung mache, von zweifelhaftem Werthe für die Beur­ theilung der einzelnen Persönlichkeiten sein. Das Urtheil, welches er hierauf gründe, werde möglicherweise sehr trügerisch sein. Der Vorsitzende, welcher nur mäßiges Talent für die Leitung der Debatte entwickle, werde vielleicht durch andere Eigenschaften zur Bekleidung einer Landgerichts­ präsidentenstelle in hohem Grade befähigt sein; der Richter, welcher in Gegenwart des Aufsichtsbeamten in der Debatte wenig hervorgetreten sei, sei möglicherweise an Rechts­ kenntnissen, an scharfem, gesundem Urtheil und an Arbeits­ kraft einem anderen bedeutend überlegen, der die Gelegen­ heit benutzt habe, um vor dem Vorgesetzten seine Rednergabe zur Geltung zu bringen. Die Berathung eines Gerichts­ kollegiums sei überhaupt nicht bestimmt, den Mitgliedern Gelegenheit zu geben, daß sie sich mit Probeleistungen vor dem Dienstvorgesetzten produzirten; sie sei der Sache halber da. Schon die Möglichkeit, daß der sachliche Charakter der Berathung durch die Anwesenheit des Aussichtsbeamten ge­ trübt werde, spreche gegen seine Zulassung, in noch ungleich höherem Grade die Gefahr, daß nicht blos in Bezug auf die Art und Weise der Geschäftsbehandlung, sondern sogar in der Beurtheilung der Sache selbst die Unbefangenheit einzelner Richter unter dem Eindrucke seiner Gegenwart leiden könnte. Das Vertrauen zur Unparteilich­ keit der Gerichte würde einen Stoß erleiden. Dem müsse vorgebeugt werden. Von Mitgliedern sämmtlicher Parteien wurde betont, daß es im allgemeinen Interesse liege, die Rechtsprechung vor jeder Beeinflussung, ja auch schon vor dem Verdachte der Beeinflussung zu schützen. Der Antrag wurde angenommen und auch bei der zweiten Lesung mit 13 gegen 1 Sümme aufrecht erhalten. Im Laufe der Verhandlung war zur Sprache ge­ kommen, daß es bei den Gerichten zum Behufe der Zeit- ersparniß vielfach üblich sei, bei einfachen Sachen sich nicht in das Berathungszimmer zurückzuziehen, sondern im Sitzungssaale zu berathen und abzustimmen. Ohne Wider­ spruch wurde festgestellt, daß die Zulässigkeit dieses Ver­ fahrens durch die beschlossene neue Fassung des §. 195 nicht beeinträchtigt werden würde; wenn Dritte sich zwar in demselben Saale befänden, aber außer Stande seien, die mit gedämpfter Stimme geführte Berathung zu ver­ nehmen, so seien sie nicht bei der Berathung zugegen. Ein Mitglied beantragte, in §. 377 der Strafprozeß­ ordnung und H. 513 der Civilprozeßordnung folgende neue Nummer einzuschalten: „kru wenn bei der Berathung und Abstimmung über das Urtheil (bezw. die Entscheidung) Personen, deren Anwesenheit gesetzlich nicht zulässig war, an­ wesend gewesen sind." Das Urtheil müsse dann stets als auf einer Verletzung des Gesetzes beruhend angesehen werden und unterliege der Re­ vision: anderenfalls werde die Revision in einem solchen Falle nur dann möglich sein, wenn bewiesen werde, daß das Urtheil, bezw. die Entscheidung auf der Verletzung des §. 195 beruhe; ein Beweis, welcher thatsächlich kaum jemals zu führen sein werde. Die rechtliche Ausführung wurde von anderer Seite als zutreffend anerkannt, den Anträgen aber entgegengehalten: Ein so weit reichender Formalismus sei nicht erforderlich, um den gefaßten Be­ schluß wirksam zu machen. Es stehe nicht zu besorgen, daß ein höherer Justizbeamter den Versuch machen werde, der klaren Vorschrift des Gesetzes zum Trotze in eine Be­ rathung sich einzudrängen. Dagegen werde die Annahme der Anträge eine sehr unliebsame und schädliche Wirkung in einer anderen Richtung üben: wenn gelegentlich ein Bote oder Gerichtsdiener oder auch ein zu einer anderen Kammer gehöriger Richter vorübergehend das Berathungs­ zimmer betrete, so werde sofort die Gefahr entstehen, daß ein solcher an sich gleichgültiger Vorgang demnächst als Revisionsgrund benutzt werden würde. Bisher habe noch jede Gesetzgebung sich gehütet, diesen Weg zu beschreiten; auch die unserige habe kein Interesse, derartigen Miß­ bräuchen Vorschub zu leisten. Die Anträge wurden ab­ gelehnt. Artikel II enthält das Strafgesetz, welches die Befolgung des in dem neuen Absätze zu §. 175 vorgesehenen Schweigebesehls zu verbürgen bestimmt ist. Zum gesetzlichen Thatbestände der Strafhandlung soll gehören, daß die Mittheilung eine unbe­ fugte sei; eine befugte Mittheilung würde die Anwendung des Strafgesetzes nicht begründen. Behufs schärferer Ab­ grenzung des Thatbestandes beantragte ein Mitglied fol­ genden Zusatz zu §. 175:1„Die Verpflichtung erstreckt sich nicht auf Mittheilungen, welche zur Wahrnehmung berech­ tigter Interessen gemacht werden." Als einen Hauptfall dieser Art führte der Antragsteller die Mittheilung an, welche der Verurtheilte seinem Vertheidiger zum Zwecke der Wiederaufnahme des Verfahrens mache. Gegen den An­ trag wurde geltend gemacht: Soweit derselbe sich auf diesen Fall beziehe, sei er überflüssig; kein Richter werde be­ zweifeln, daß diese Mittheilung eine befugte sei. Dagegen sei der Antrag insofern nicht unbedenklich, als er dahin mißverstanden werden könne, auch eine Mittheilung, welche ein Betheiligter der Presse mache, um sich gegen Zeitungs­ artikel zu vertheidigen, sei schon wegen des Zweckes der­ selben als eine solche anzusehen, welche der Verpflichtung zur Geheimhaltung der betreffenden Thatsachen nicht zu­ widerlaufe. Der Antrag wurde abgelehnt. Der Artikel II wurde unverändert angenommen. 76» 710 Reichstag. Aktenstück Nr. 169.

Zum Ankauf der Remontepferde. Auf die Anfrage, ob der Preis der Remonteu sich nicht hätte vermindern lassen, wenn man größere Bezüge aus Ostpreußen gemacht hätte, führt die Verwaltung aus: „Eine allgemeine Erhöhung der Pferdepreise ist in Folge der großen Nachfragen und des bedeutenden An­ kaufs von Pferden für das Ausland unverkennbar, und kann der Ausfuhr der für Militärzwecke geeigneten Pferde nur dadurch vorgebeugt werden, daß für Remonteu höhere Preise gezahlt werden. Ein weiterer Grund der Erhöhung der Durchschnittspreise für Remonteu ist aber auch der, daß in Folge der höheren Anforderungen an die Militär­ dienstpferde nur gutes Material gekauft werden darf, für welches auch entsprechend höhere Preise anzulegen sind. Ein weiterer vermehrter Ankauf in Ostpreußen, wo­ selbst jetzt jährlich über 5000 Remonteu erkauft werden, ist nicht ausführbar, da dort alles brauchbare Material aufgekauft wird. Bei einem selbst möglichen Mehrankaufe von Remonten in Ostpreußen würde eine Schädigung der sonst noch Pferde züchtenden Provinzen hervorgerufen, besonders aber eine Schädigung der Landespferdezucht, durch welche der Bedarf von Pferden für den Fall einer Mobilmachung in Frage gestellt werden würde." Kapitel 33 Titel 4 Preußen: Die Nothwendigkeit, die Kosten für die Bewirthschastung der Remontedepots in so hohem Grade zu steigern, wird von der Verwaltung in folgender Weise erläutert: „Die Ueberschreitung des Titels um 180 593,32 ^ ist in Folge von Mindereinnahmen der Depots im Betrage von 96 293,17 ^ und von Mehrausgaben der Depots, denen jedoch Erstattungen gegenüberstehen, entstanden. Abgesehen von solchen Mehrausgaben bei speziellen Betriebszweigen, welche durch Mehreinnahmen bei denselben gedeckt sind, von den minder erheblichen Mehr- und den Minderausgaben bei einzelnen Titeln, bestehen die Mehr­ ausgaben der Depots gegen den Etat speziell in folgenden, und zwar: an Tagelohn1rund 48 260 für das todte Inventar1......1-12916001- für Vieharzneien und dergl. .1. . .1-1211301- für Hafer, Ersatz- und Kraftsuttermittel und dergl11 - 17460 - für Saatgetreide und Sämereien ... - 8010 - für Brücken, Wege und1Gräben1...1-1119601- für Umwährungen und1Brunnen1...1-1518701- an Abgaben und Lasten1-13 220 - In dem Tagelohn find auch die Kosten des Ersatzes für fehlende Dienstleute, wie Knechte, und des Dreschens auf Tagelohn rc. mit Maschinen inbegriffen, die Mehrausgaben hierfür werden dnrch die Minderausgaben an Dienstlöhnen im Betrage von rund 5260 ^ und an Dreschlerlohn in Natur gedeckt. Im Uebrigen sind die Mehrausgaben an Tagelohn hauptsächlich durch die ver­ mehrte Anstellung von Arbeitern zu den nothwendigen land- wirthschaftlichen Arbeiten in Folge stärkeren Getreide- und Erdfruchtbaues, zur stärkeren und besseren Bearbeitung des Ackers, Bewältigung stärkerer Ernten auf einzelnen Depots, Kohlen Steinkohle Plauenschen Grund.

Die Mehrausgaben für Unterhaltung des Inventars sind durch die stärkere Abnutzung desselben und die nothwendig gewesenen Neubeschaffungen, zur Ergänzung und Vervoll­ ständigung der Inventarien der Depots mit Maschinen, Instrumenten und Gerüchen rc. verbesserter Konstruktion, sowie durch Ergänzung der Nutz- und Schirrholzvorräthe auf einzelnen Depots entstanden. Die übrigen Mehrausgaben, und zwar an Vieharzneien, sind durch vermehrte Erkrankungen bei den Remonten und größeren Bedarf an Desinfektionsmitteln und Futtersalz; für Hafer rc. durch Minderertrag, höhere Haferrationen an Stelle fehlenden Heues und Strohes, dem eine ent­ sprechende Minderausgabe bei diesen gegenübersteht, und erforderlich gewesene Futterzulagen; für Saatgetreide und Sämereien durch Ernteausfälle, nothwendig gewesenen Saatwechsel und größeren Bedarf; für Brücken, Wege, Gräben, durch vermehrt nothwendig gewesene Wege- und Graben-Arbeiten und Plasterungen; für Umwährung und Brunnen, durch nothwendig ge­ wordene Erneuerung von Zäunen um Höfe und Gärten und Hofumwährungen, Verbesserung von Tummelplätzen und vermehrte Brunnen- und Pumpen-Reparaturen, endlich au Abgaben durch höhere Ausschreibungen und Bedarf veranlaßt. Detaillirte Wirthschaftspläne (Ueberschläge) werden unter Zugrundelegung der angenommenen Feldeiutheilung und Fruchtfolge für jedes Depot für 3 Jahre im Voraus fest­ gestellt und in diesen auch für die gewöhnliche Unterhaltung des Inventars und der Wege, im Anhalt an den Bedarf der letzten Jahre, Beträge ausgeworfen. Zur Neubeschaffung größerer Jnventarienstücke und größerer Wegebauten werden die Mittel in jedem einzelnen Bedarfsfälle vom Kriegsministerium bewilligt. Zu Abweichungen von dem festgestellten Wirthschafts­ plan, wenn sie irgend erheblich, namentlich bezüglich des finanziellen Effekts, haben die Remontedepot-Administrationen die Genehmigung des Kriegsministeriums einzuholen. Die Selbstbewirthschaftung der Remontedepots läßt sich, soll der Zweck derselben, die für die Armee angekauften jungen Remontepferde bis zu deren Abgabe an die Truppe aufzunehmen und zur Vervollkommnung ihrer körperlichen Entwickelung gut und möglichst billig zu ernähren, erreicht werden, nicht einschränken."

Mit diesen Maßgaben find die einzelnen Bestimmungen des Entwurfs, wie folgt, zu begründen: Die §§. 1 bis 4 enthalten, in thunlichst engem An­ schluß an die bezüglichen Festsetzungen des österreichisch­ italienischen Vertrages, ein Verbot derjenigen Veranstaltungen, welche ganz besonders eine massenhafte Vertilgung von Vögeln herbeizuführen geeignet sind. Vorangestellt ist im §. 1 als die weitgehendste und allgemeinste Maßnahme das bereits in allen einschlägigen Gesetzgebungen enthaltene Verbot der die Fortpflanzung der Vögel beeinträchtigenden Nachstellungen, das Verbot der Zerstörung der Brutstätten und Eier der Vögel. Aus­ nahmen von diesem Verbot sind nur zugelassen in Betreff der an Gebäuden und dergleichen befindlichen Nester, sowie im Absatz 3 für die als Nahrungsmittel geschätzten Eier gewisser Wasser- und Sumpfvögel. Diese Vögel (§. 1 Absatz 3) gehören zwar nach den meisten Landesgesetz­ gebungen zum jagdbaren Federwild und fallen daher, gemäß §. 8 b ohnehin nicht unter die Verbotsbestimmnngen des Gesetzentwurfs; da indessen der Rechtszustand kein für dasge- sammte Reichsgebiet durchaus gleichartiger ist, so erschien die Aufnahme einer besonderen Ausnahmebestimmung bezüglich der Eier dieser Vögel räthlich. Nach Ansicht der Sachver­ ständigen ist das Sammeln der Eier von Strandvögeln bis zum 1. Mai, desgleichen von Möven und Seeschwalben bis zum 15. Juni zu gestatten; indessen wird es vorzu­ ziehen sein, den Erlaß dieser nach den verschiedenen lokalen Verhältnissen sehr variirenden Bestimmungen der Landes­ polizei zu überlassen. Hieran reiht sich im §. 2 das Verbot derjenigen Fang­ arten, welche eine Massenerlegung ermöglichen; das Ver­ zeichniß derselben ist auf Grund neuerdings unter sachver­ ständigem Beirath erfolgter Erörterungen etwas abweichend von den bezüglichen Bestimmungen des Entwurfs von1879/83 gestaltet worden, um dasselbeden besonderen deutschen Verhält­ nissen genauer anzupassen. Was insbesondere die Vorschrift unter b anlangt, so ist hier dem Bundesrath die Befugniß zur Gewährung von Ausnahmen vorbehalten (§. 5 Absatz 4), da das Verbot des Fangens und der Erlegung von Vögeln für dieZeit, w ährendwelcherder BodenmitSchneebedeckt ist, im Zu- sammenhalt mit dem §. 3 des Entwurfs, in einigen Gebirgs­ gegenden dem gänzlichen Verbote des Vogelfangens nahe kommen würde. Im §. 2e ist, den Vorschlägen des deutschen Landwirthschaftsraths entsprechend, auch das Fangen unter Anwendung geblendeter Lockvögel als unzulässig bezeichnet worden. Nach der Schlußbestimmung soll das Verzeichniß erforderlichenfalls einer Vervollständigung durch Beschluß des Bundesraths unterliegen. Im §. 3 ist, den Vorschlägen der Sachverständigen entsprechend, die Sommerzeit vom 1. März bis zum 15. September als allgemeine Schonzeit für die Vögel fest­ gesetzt, unter Erweiterung der bezüglichen Fristbestimmung des österreichisch-italienischen Vertrages dahin, daß auch die (in diesem Vertrage zugelassene) Erlegung der Vögel mittelst Schußwaffen in der Zeit vom 1. bis 15. September unter­ sagt ist. Die Verbotsbestimmungen in den 1 bis 4 erscheinen ganz allgemein aus den Vogelfang anwendbar; von der Aufstellung eines Verzeichnisses der sogenannten nützlichen Vögel ist daher in Uebereinstimmung mit den bei den früheren Berathungen überwiegend hervorgetretenen An­ schauungen Abstand genommen worden. Ohnehin würde die Trennung in nützliche und schädliche Vogelarten bei dem gegenwärtigen Stande der Erfahrungen unüberwindliche Schwierigkeiten bieten. Dagegen sind diejenigen Vogelarten, welche sich als überwiegend schädlich oder jedenfalls als nicht wesentlich nützlich darstellen, von dem Schutze des vorliegenden Gesetzes auszunehmen. Unter diesem Gesichtspunkte ist das in dem früheren Entwurf enthaltene Verzeichniß nach dem jetzigen Stande der Erfahrungen revidirt und erheblich er­ weitert worden (§. 8o), so daß vielfache, gerade in der hier fraglichen Hinsicht erhobene Bedenken gegen den Entwurf als beseitigt angesehen werden dürfen. Daß ferner auch von den Bestimmungen im §. 3 Aus­ nahmen für solche Fälle zugelassen werden müssen, in welchen sonst nützliche Vögel Schaden anstiften, war bereits im §. 3 Absatz 2 des Entwurfs von 1879/83 zum Aus­ druck gelangt. Es unterliegt keinem Bedenken, die dort materiell etwas enger begrenzte Ausnahmevorschrift auf alle Fälle besonderer Schadenstiftung zu erstrecken. Dagegen erscheint es. andererseits unthunlich, die Handhabung einer so weitgehenden Befugniß dem einzelnen Betheiligten zu überlassen, da alsdann der durch das Gesetz beabsichtigte Schutz über­ haupt nicht mehr wirksam kontrolirt werden könnte. Es werden vielmehr Behörden, welche zur Prüfung der ört­ lichen Verhältnisse geeignet und von den Landesregierungen hierzu bezeichnet sind (Landrath, Bezirksamtmann, Amts­ hauptmann, Oberamt rc.), zu ermächtigen sein, für solche Theile ihres Verwaltungsbezirks, in welchen sich wegen des Vorkommens von Schadenstiftungen die Schonzeitbestim­ mungen nicht in vollem Umfange durchführen lassen, eine auf die betroffenen Oertlichkeiten sich erstreckende Ausnahme zu gestatten. Wo eine allgemeine Anordnung dieser Be­ hörde als nothwendig sich nicht erweist, wird der Grund­ besitzer sich regelmäßig durch Verscheuchen der Thiere in auskömmlicher Weise schützen können. Um die Gleichmäßig­ keit des Vorgehens der Lokalbehörden zu sichern und das in dieser Beziehung vorhandene technische Material zu verwerthen, muß dem Bundesrath der Erlaß einer all­ gemeinen Anweisung vorbehalten bleiben. Diesen Zwecken entspricht die Fassung des §. 5 Ab­ satz 1 und 3 des Entwurfs. Der Absatz 2 des letzteren Paragraphen wahrt die auch in dem früheren Entwurf aufgenommene Befugniß zur Ausnahmebewilligung für wissenschaftliche oder Lehrzwecke oder wegen besonderer ört­ licher Bedürfnisse. Der Ausschluß der nach Maßgabe des Landesrechts jagdbaren Vögel von den Bestimmungen des gegenwärtigen Gesetzes (§. 8 b des Entwurfs) ist bereits in der allgemeinen Begründung erörtert. Daneben ist aber auch, in Rücksicht­ nahme auf die bei den früheren Berathungen geltend ge­ machten Gründe, der in der bisher üblichen Weise betriebene Krammetsvogelfang den Vorschriften dieses Gesetzes ent­ zogen worden (§. 8 Schlußsatz). Der Ausschluß des in der Land- und Hauswirthschaft gehaltenen zahmen Feder­ viehes (§. 8 a) ergiebt sich aus der Natur der Sache. Was die Höhe der gegen Uebertretungen des Gesetzes anzudrohenden Strafe (§§. 6 und 7) anlangt, so wird daran festzuhalten sein, daß die Maximalgrenze nicht zu niedrig bemessen werden darf und daß auch die Erkennung einer Freiheitsstrafe zugelassen werden muß, um den in größerem Umfange stattfindenden, sowie den lediglich aus Rohheit veranlaßten Eingriffen wirksam entgegentreten zu können. Im §. 9 ist, der bereits oben dargelegten Abgrenzung entsprechend, wonach der Gesetzentwurf das Mindestmaß des den Vögeln zu gewährenden Schutzes festzusetzen bezweckt, das Verhältniß zum Landesrecht dahin geregelt, daß die­ jenigen landesgesetzlichen, bezw. nach Maßgabe der Landes­ verfassung von den Polizeibehörden erlassenen Bestimmungen, welche zum Schutz der Vögel weitergehende Verbote ent­ halten, unberührt bleiben. Es wird dies insbesondere Reichstag. Aktenstück Nr. 198. (Bericht der Reichsschulden-Kominission.) 875 Rekapitulation.

Majestät haben zu gestatten geruht, daß die lomb.-venetia- nischen Emigrirten entweder zurückkehren oder die Erlaubniß zur Aus wanderung nachsuchen dürfen. Im letztem Falle sind sie gleich jenen österr. Unterthanen zu behandeln- welche mit Zustimmung der kompe tenten Behörden ausgewandert sind. Von diesem Gnadenakte sind jedoch jene ausgenommen,, welche von der am 12. itnb 22. August 1849 er theilten Amnestie ausgeschlossen wurden. * Der Herr FMö. von Legeditsch beabsichtigt im nächsten Mo nate 20,990 Mann seines Korps in und bei Hamburg zu einem UebungS- manöver zusammenzuziehen. * Der Hochw. Herr Fürstbischof zu Briren, Bernhard Ga l.ur a, welcher schon seit Jahren der Gemeinde Windischmatrei zum Behufe der Dotirung eineS Schullehrers namhafte Unterstützungsbeiträge auö Ei genem zuwendete, hat neuerdings zu diesem Zwecke der erwähnten Ge meinde die Kapitalssumme von 1990 fl. einhändigen lassen. * Nach einer Verfügung deS MinisterratheS ist gestattet worden, daß daS Zwangs-Darlehen in der Lombardei und Venedig auf 12 Mo nats-Raten vertheilt werde, wonach in jedem Monat ein barer Betrag von S Mill. Lire einzubringen ist. * Der k. k.

Gleichzeitig wird auch der Bundestag zusammentreten und die Revision der Bundesverfassung und der Bundeögesitze in Angriff nehmen. * Die Eefammtzahl der in der österreichischen Monarchie im lau fenden Jahre erscheinenden Zeitschriften beträgt 251/ * Die Anzeichen einer weit ausgreifenden Thätigkeit der Chefs der magyarischen Revolution haben die österr. Regierung bewogen, in die Freilassung der in Kiutahia Jnternirten nicht zu willigen, obwohl die Pforte, von England und Frankreich-unterstützt, dieselbe beim Wiener Kabinete dringend beantragte. * Der „N. M. Z." wird auS bester Quelle versichert, daß von Seiten Englands und Frankreichs keine förmlichen Protestationen gegen den Eintritt Gesammtösterreichs in den deutschen Bund, sondern nur Vorstellungen gegen Räthlichkeit dieses Schrittes ergangen find, gegen welchen von Seite Rußlands keinerlei Einwand erhoben wird. * Vor einigen Tagen überreichten mehre Zollkongreß - Deputirten dem Herrn Handelsminister eine Adresse, worin verschiedene Bedenken gegen die baldige Einführung deS neuen Zolltarifs ausgesprochen sind. Diese möge erst dann erfolgen, heißt es, wenn von Deutschland ent sprechende Zugeständnisse gemacht, und wenigsten» eine Uebereinkunft über den freien Verkehr mit Ackerbau-Erzeugnissen, über TarisSbestimmun- gcn, dann ein Cartel für die Douane und eine dem Schutzzoll entspre chende Strafgesetzgebung erfolgt sind. * Die Zerfahrenheit der Ministerial-Konferenz in Dresden, an wel cher Oesterreich nicht die geringste Schuld trägt, dauert fort. Der bai rische Minister-Präsident gibt sich viele Mühe die schwebende Differenz auszugleichen, was vermuthen läßt, daß ,S sich in der That um gewisse Vortheile handelt, welche Baiern von der Konferenz beansprucht und die ihm Preußen streitig macht. Der ChoruS der englischen und französi schen Presse gegen die Neugestaltung der Dinge in Deutschland soll von Berlin aus eingeleitet worden fein. * Tie Besetzung der politischen Stellen in Dalmatien, vom Statt halter abwärts, soll nächstens erfolgen. DaS Gerücht, daß Graf M a r- zani auS Venedig die Ernennung zum Statthalter von Dalmatien abgelehnt habe, entbehrt jedes Grundes. Dem Grafen Mar zani wurde jener hohe Posten gar nicht angetragen. * In Sarajewo (Bosnien) wird eine k. k. Posterpedition aufge stellt, die vom i. März 1851 wöchentlich eine Botenverbindung mit dem Postamte Brod tn Slavonien unterhalten wird. * In Aleppo wurde eine Versteigerung der Effekten Bem'S abge halten.

Stocke eines Hauses auf daS Pflaster, und, wie durch ein Wunder, beschädigte sich dasselbe beinahe gar nicht. * In Galizien soll ein landwirthschaftlicher Verein gegründet wer den, um die Israeliten dieses KronlandeS dem Ackerbaue zuzuführen. * Graf Straffoldo, der Civil-Statthalter der Lombardei, ist in Mailand angekommen, wo er jedoch nur kurze Zeit verweilen und dann nach Verona zurückkehren wird. Im nächsten Monat wird Graf Strassoldo mit dem FM. Grafen Radetzky, der sein Hauptquar tier nach Mailand verlegen soll, wieder in der letztgenannten Stadt eintreffen. - * Man begegnete in den Zeitungen oft der Nachricht, daß Omer Pascha von Bem, zur Zeit als dieser in Siebenbürgen kommandirte, b> deutende Geschenke, darunter auch die Krone deS heil. Stefan erhal ten habe. Einem im Nachlasse Bem'S vorgefundenen Briefe von Om er Pascha zu Folge, hat dieser nie die Geschenke, die ihm Bem durch einen gewissen Herrn Bollick zusandte, erhalten. Der Letztere dürste sie wahrscheinlich unterschlagen haben. * Wir haben gestern von der in Innsbruck am 20. d. erfolgten feierlichen Beisetzung mehrerer Tapfern berichtet. AuS Versehen ist dabei der Name deS Theresien-RitterS, HauptmannS Anton Baron Pirquet, weggeblieben, der sich bei Goito rühmlichst ausgezeichnet, und bei dem Sturme auf Rivoli am 22. Juli 1848 den Heldentod gefunden hat. - * In Triest wurde am 23. Febr. der gewesene Platz-Oberst, pm- sionirte GM. Strobel mit den üblichen militärsschen Ehren zu Grabe begleitet. ' * In Zara ist am 19. d. die k. k. Dampffregatte „S. Lucia« von Fiume angekommen. Sie führt daS 3. Bataillon von Heß- Infante rie nach Ragusa, um die dortige Garnison zu verstärken. Deutschland. Ueber die Regelung der dänischen Erbfolge ver nimmt ein norddeutsches Blatt Folgendes: Der Großherzog von Olden burg erbt den Thron von Dänemark; mit Holstein werden in diesem Falle die Eutin'schen Lande verbunden. Der Herzog von Augustenburg übernimmt unter Verzichtleistung auf seine sämmtlichen, in den Herzog- thümern liegenden Besitzungen zu Gunsten deS Landes daS Großherzog thum Oldenburg ohne Eutin. Die Augustenburger Linie hört dadurch für alle Zeiten auf, erbberechtigt in Dänemark und Schleswig-Holstein zu fein. Der Kaiser von Rußland verzichtet auf jedes Erbrecht in Hol stein oder Dänemark; hingegen fuccedirt nach Aussterben deS Oldenbur ger Hauses die Glücksbürger Linie; nur im Fall auch diese letztere auS- sterben sollte, würde daS Erbrecht d«S russischen Kaiserhauses wieder aufleben. Tags-Neuigkeiten. * In der Umgebung von München sind in der letzten Zeit v'ele verheerende FeuerSbrünste vorgekommen, wobei aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach verbrecherische Hände im Spiele sind. * In Karlsruhe werden in Abwesenheit deS preußischen Gesandten v. S a v i g n Y, der in Privatangelegenheiten nach Berlin gereist ist, die laufenden Geschäfte durch den Attache v. Peucker, Sohn des Ge neral-Lieutenants und frühern Reichsministers, besorgt. * DaS Hofgericht in Gießen hat den Dr. Dieffenbach aus Schlitz, dermalen in Bremen, wegen ReligionSläfterung zu einem Jahr Festungsarrest verurtheilt. * Die „Ostfee-Ztg." meldet aus Stettin 21. Februar, daß der Pferdeverkauf bis auf Weiteres eingestellt wurde. * Die badische Regierung hat bei der vorauszusehenden Ankunft von entlassenen schleSwig-holsteinische Soldaten in Süddeutschland und bei der Furcht vor revolutionärer Propaganda umfassende polizeiliche Vorsichtsmaßregeln angeordnet. Frankreich. Das Manifest deS Grafen v. C h ä m b o r d hat in Paris nur geringen Eindruck gemacht. In den Departements durfte eS dasselbe Schicksal erleben. Praktisch gesprochen ist die legitimistische Partei todt und lebt nur als Erinnerung. * In Toulon werden zwei neue Linienschiffe „der Napoleon" und «der Charlemagne" ausgerüstet. * Eine Lütticher Waffenfabrik hatte bei der französischen Regierung um die Bewilligung nachgesucht, eine Partie Feuerwaffen, die für die Zeughäuser von Zürich und Bern bestimmt seien, durch Frankreich führen zu dürfen. Ueber eingeholte Erkundigung der französischen Gesandtschaft stellte eS sich heraus, daß das Züricher Zeugamt keine solche Waffen bestellt habe. Italien. AuS Turin wird gemeldet, daß Hr. de Andreis, vom Appellationstribunale zu Casale, das ihm angetragene Portefeuille der Justiz angenommen habe. Großbritannien. Im Unterhause hat Hr. Mac Gregor eine neue Basis für die Einhebung der Einkommensteuer vorgeschlagen. — Ein Mitglied der radikalen Partei, Hr. Locke-King, hat die Bewilligung nachgesucht, eine Bill einzubringen, welche den Zweck hat, in Betreff deS Wahlrechtes die Städte den Landbezirken gleichzustellen, und das Stimmrecht allen Jenen zu geben, die ein Grundstück von 10 Pfd. St. Ertrag besitzen. Diese Maßregel, vorzüglich gegen daö Uebergewicht der Ackerbauintereffen gerichtet, wurde von Lord John Rüssel bekämpft. DaS Haus hat jedoch die Motion mit 100 gegen 52 Stimmen votirt. * Die in London anwesenden Italiener haben eine Versammlung abgehalten, in welcher sie mehre Beschlüsse faßten, die gegen die päpst liche Bulle, in Betreff der bischöflichen Ernennungen, gerichtet sind. Wie». Der Gemeinderath hat den k. k. Hofmaler Hrn.Einöle be auftragt, daö Bildniß Sr. Majestät zu malen, welches die Bestimmung 7 at > Sitzungssaale deS Magistrates aufgestellt zu werden.

Die Schüler nyalten nicht nur Unterricht in den vorgeschriebenen Gegenständen und Sprachen, sondern sie werden auch mit allen Schreib- und Zeichenge- räthen unentgeldlich versorgt. Ern Unbekannter hat dem Gemeinderathe auS Anlaß der Bür- ^Erlsterwahl 2000 fl.

Dem „Lloyd" Fügendes geschrieben: ES ist Gottlob von unserm Herrn d aß fidi C * n Wohcheit j- 0 viel Guteö und Rühmliches zu erzählen, alte A Zeitungen nicht zu beeilen brauchten, ohne Prüfung jede. "ekdote nachzudrucken, die einem oder dem andern der minorum 8 n mw -ex Journalisten, der eben eine Lücke auszufüllen hat, gefällig N, auf den Namen Sr. Majestät zu taufen. Demungeachtet macht feit e nlgen Tagen eine Ballanekdote die Runde durch unsere Tageblätter; Herr Saphir hat sie sogar durch Verse verherrlicht, und der „Lloyd" oem NeuigkeitS-Bureau entnommen. Hätte man sich genauer erkundigt, so würde man gewiß erfahren haben, daß die Frau Erzherzogin, Mutter Sr. Majestät, schon seit einer langen Reihe von Jahren, und auch wäh rend des gegenwärtigen Karnevals an keinem Tanze Theil genommen habe; vielleicht hätten sie auch darüber sich zu beruhigen Gelegenheit gefunden, daß in keinem gesellschaftlichen Cirkel Wiens ein Nichtadeliger, wenn er des Kaisers Kriegsrock mit Ehre trägt, gegen einen Adeligen zurückgesetzt zu werden Gefahr läuft. * Die bereits angekündigten Gedichte deS BanusJellachich kön nen wegen Erkrankung eines bei der Ausstattung beschäftigten Lithogra phen erst in 14 Tagen erscheinen. * Der Professor und Kupferstecher Stöber unternimmt den Stich des Miitelbildes der Fresken, welche Kupelwieser im Funktions saale der Statthalterei ausführte. Dasselbe stellt die Austria vor, um geben von mehreren allegorischen Figuren. * Am Ufer des Donaukanales unter der Franzens-Kettenbrücke wurde vorgestern ein todtgeborneS Kind gefunden. * Vor dem k. k. Bezirksgerichte kam vor einigen Tagen der interes sante Fall zur Verhandlung, daß ein hiesiger Arzt, Herr Dr. Stup per der Vernachlässigung eines Patienten angeklagt wurde. Da eS sich jedoch nicht herausstellte, daß die Gestorbene Julians Sch. durch den sogleich erfolgten ärztlichen Besuch zu retten gewesen wäre, so wurde Hr. Dr. Stupper von der Anklage freigesprochen. * In der Werkstätte deS Tischlermeisters Herrn Karl S. auf der Wieden entstand vorgestern unter den Gesellen ein solch heftiger Rauf handel, daß einer derselben bedeutend verletzt wurde. In Folge dieses blutigen Auftrittes wurden vier der Erzedenten arretirt. * In SechShauS wurde der Ingenieur Georg Z., welcher sich fälschlich für einen Polizeikommissär ausgab, angehalten. * In letzter Zeit kamen öfter Fälle vor, daß falsche Sperrsitzkar ten zu den Vorstellungen im Kärntnerthortheater verkauft wurden; daS Publikum kann daher beim Ankäufe derselben nicht genug vorsichtig sein. Ein Herr kaufte vorgestern im Gasthause im Komödiengäßchen 3 Sperr sitze zu der letzten Aufführung des „Oberon". Zu seinem Erstaune« waren jedoch die Plätze, als er mit zweien seiner Freunde in das Thea ter kam, bereits besetzt. Als er seine Ansprüche darauf geltend zu ma chen suchte, erkannte man, daß die BilletS falsch seien. Der Fälscher, ein dicnstloser Kommis Andreas ©., wurde bereits erforscht und arretirt. * Dem Fabriksarbeiter Urban Gran, der in FünfhauS Nr. 29 wohnt, wurden vorgestern 127 fl. in Silberzwanzigern, und 184 fl. CM. in Banknoten aus einem versperrten Koffer gestohlen. Dem thätigen und umsichtsvollen Polizei-Kommissariate in Sechshaus ist eS jedoch be reits gelungen, die Thäterin, eine Taglöhnerin, zu entdecken, und der Bestohlene dürfte dadurch sein Eigenthum schnell unv ohne Abgang wie der zurückerhalten. * Gestern hörten wir im Kärnthnerthortheater zum ersten Male dieAdam'scheOper: „Der Brauer vonPreston." Sie ist bereits vor mehreren Jahren im Josefstädter-Theater gegeben worden, ohne einen bedeutenden Erfolg erringen zu können. Nichts desto weniger wurde ste aus ihrer Vergessenheit hervorgesucht; denn eS gilt ja die Spieloper im Kärnthnerthortheater zu kultiviren. Das beste Mittel dazu ist die Besetzung derselben mit einer Anfängerin, wie Frl. To mala, die zwar eine frische, schöne bildungsfähige Stimme hat und Talent besitzt, aber weder singen noch spielen kann unv mit einem sonst tüchtigen Sän ger wie Herr Erl, dessen schwächste Seite, wie bekannt, die dramatische Darstellung ist. Durchaus lobenSwerlh war an diesem Abende nur Herr Hölzl. Die Vorstellung mißglückte gänzlich und daS Publikum schien den Erfolg geahnt zu haben, denn eS fand sich zu dieser ersten Vorstel lung nur sehr spärlich ein.

S mi th, Borfitzer. Ein nenes Conzil. Ein offiziöses Organ der französischen Regierung, der „Telegraphe" meldet, dass das durch den Krieg von 1870 und den Einzug der italienischen Truppen in Rom inte terbrochen ökomenischen Konzil gegen Ende des Jahres wieder aufgenommen werden soll. Leo XIII. soll seit seiner Thronbesteigung mit dem Gedanken, das Konzil wieder einzuberufen, umge gangen und durch die gegenwärtige Lage der Kirche darin bestärkt worden sein. Vor allem wäre ihm darum zu thun, mit den Bischöfen eine Berhalungslinie in ihrer Beziehung zu der Staatsgewalt zu vereinbaren. Die Frage, dieser Konzil stand schon auf dem Programm des Konzils von 1870 und war in den Anschüssen erörtert worden. Die Notwendigkeit eines Beschlusses auf diesem Gebiete ist drin gender als je und scheint auf Leo XIII. einen entscheidenden Einfluß zu üben. Wahrscheinlich würde das Konzil sich auch mit dem Kongregationen zu schäftigen und Reformen vorzuschlagen haben, welche ihren Fort. Bestand in Frankreich sichern könnten. Was die im Vatikan herrschende Furcht, dass die französische Regierung ihre Bischöfen nicht gestatten würde, nach Rom zu reisen, betrifft, so stützt sich auf bloße Vermuthungen, da noch wenn auch noch so indirekte Anfrage an die Regierung ergangen ist. Monsignore Cataldi, der Zeremonienmeister Leo's XIII., ist eben in Paris angekommen. Der „Telegraphe" stellt die Frage, ob er mit einer Mission hinsichtlich des Konzils betraut sei. Eine paffende Zeitfrage. Welchen Höhepunkt muffen wohl die durch Wasfer und Feuer verursachten Schrecken, bis das amerikanische Volk sich unwillig erhebt, um Devenfiv-und Repressiv Maßregeln zu ergreifen? Seit Beginn des Sommers kam in unserem Land eine Reihe fast beispielloser Unglücksfälle-vor. Dampfer verbält an fütigen oder bohrten einander in den Grund, so daß zahlreiche Leben der Strafbaren Gleichgültigkeit und Unacht (umfassen) derjenigen, auf welche das Volk ein große und bliebenden Vertrauen fetzte, zum Opfer fielen. Ein Kohlen Ichacht oder ein Tunnel stürzte ein und sendete Dutzendejvon Arbeitern unter schweren Todeskämpfe, die fich eher denken als beschreiben lassen, in die andere Welt. Individuelle SelbsteutleibungS-Fälle find kaum erwähnen Wert, daß fie an Bedeutung und Interesse verlieren, wenn mit den "Schlächtereien im Großen" verglichen, welche so schrechliche Lücken in's Familien-Leben rissen. Und doch haben ben nur wenige dieser Calatiniäten, wenn fie untersucht würden, einen Ausdruck des Tadels bei Jenen hervorgerufen, denen die feierliche Pflicht oblag, der Verantwortlichkeit auf den Grund zu kommen. Was wird wohl die Untersuchung des Zusammenstoßes der Dampfer "Narraganf und Stonington", die Untersuchung der Cöllifion des Dampfer "Garland- milder Dampf-acht" Mamielür weiten Folge haben, als daß die Kie abgegebene Benedikte auszufüllig lauten werden.

Juna-Amerika. beitshaus, von da in daS Gefängnis und Zuchthaus, sind sie aber einmal zufällig frei, so belästigen sie sicherlich ihre Mitbürger und die Gerichte. So lesen wir in einem unserer Wechselblätter von Cleveland, O. Folgenöcke: „Frau Isaac ließ den achtjährigen Washington Irving Beeney und den neunjährigen Frank William, zwei Knaben von der Westseite, verhaften, weil sie in Gemeinschaft mit anderen Bünden am Morgen ihren kleinen Sohn Warren der Kleidung entblößten und ihn dann mit einem Leder-Rüne abwechselnd für lange schlugen, bis sie zu erschöpft waren, und die grausamkeiten Spiel fortzusetzen. Einer solchen That liegt gar nichts Kindliche zu Grunde, denn Kinder lieben wohl, Dinge zu zerstören, verstehen fügenuicht gern Schmerz tu. Das ist rafstürte Grausamkeit, und die Eltern solcher Kinder find wahrlich nicht zuweide. Die Anwalt des Glases. Ein altes Sprichwort, dessen Währheit fich vielfach erprobt hat, sagt, dass derjenige, welcher in einem Glaubenschlecht, auf Andere nicht mit Steinen werden solle. Allein, mag immerhin das Sprichwort im Moralische Sinnerecht hat, die materielle und mechanische Welt weist heutzutage, durch die praktische Anwendung auf die Baukunst sein ähnliches nach, da selbst Häuser aus GlaS werden müssen. Eine Furcht zu hegen braucht, dass die Steinen eingeworfen werden, daß die Steinen eingeworfen werden. Wenn man Eisenbahnschwellen aus GlaS machen kann, die Widerstandkraft genug befürchtet, um den Stoff schwer bei der Stadt fchwer bei der Stadt fchwer bei der Gebälke auszuhalten, kann man wohl nicht mehr in Abrede stellen wollen, dass die GlaS nicht auch zu Wänden und Dächern, ja selbst zum Gebälke vorgenommen werden kann. Es wird die Zeit kommen, wo man Wände ausfarbigem GlaS und Zimmerböden aus starkem Papier an das unzerstörbare Gebälke ausgelegt werden kann. Wenn GlaS zu so geringe Kosten Hergestellt werden kann, dass man unzerstörbare Eisenbahnschwellen daraus macht, so wird auch Niemandem der Gedanke, zu Baumaterial zu verwenden, schmärifch erscheinen. Ist es im Hinblick auf die neuesten Entdeckungen de la Bastie's, H. Lindfay's, Bucknall's Siemens' und Anderer, welche «achgewiesen haben, dass GlaS eine Spannkraft von 635 Tonnen auf den Quadratzoll aus hält und hergestellt werden kann, dass ein der Hitze, wie der Kälte Wiederstand leistet, während es auch in Form von nur 4—5 zöltigen Schwellen den Druck eines schweren EisenbahnzugS auszuhalten vermag, ohne eine wahrnehmbare Spur desselben zu zeigen ist dann nicht möglich, dass dem sogenannten Eisenbahnzug weißen muss. De la Bastie nimmt jeden Gegenstand aus dem von ihm fabricierte. ten Glase und taucht ihn bei Weißgluth in ein Bad von verschiedenen Oelen und Fetten. Die daraus erfolgende, Hörte hängt größtentheils von der relativen Tenoräur sowohl des GlaS, als auch des BadeS ab. Weiches KrystallglaS auS Soda, Blei und Kalk zusammengesetzt, hat sich wettig besser erwiesen, als eine gewöhnliche Sodatalkmischung allein je heißer das GlaS ist, wenn es einge taucht wird, um so besser taugte zur Einweichung. Dass Gleiche lässt sich von dem Bade sagen. Gewöhnlich angelassenes GlaS, welches die Stärke von etwa 7000 Pfund auf den Qua drängen besitzt, erhält mittelö. Forgfältiger Abkühlung in freier Lust die doppelte Stärke, und wenn es dann noch mit Öl behandelt wird, erfährt feine Stärke eine Steigerung bis auf 34,200 Pfund auf den Qua drängen. Moran es liegt das in unserer glorreichen Republik ein so unverhältnis große Anzahl jugendlicher Raufbolde und Bösewichter aufzuweisen, wollen wir nicht zu erklären suchen, doch steht die Tatsache selbst ohne Zweifel fest. Die Rohheit beginnt bei diesen Menschen ungemein frühzeitig und reist, mit ächtamerikanischer Schnelligkeit. Erst vor ein paar Tagen begangen wir bei der hiefigen Brücke einer Rotte nichtswürdiger Buben, welche eine arme Katze auf's Entsetzlichste mächtigten, und dabei wie die Türken flüchten. Als man uns herannahen sah zerstöben fie wie Spreu vor dem Winde. Was ist die Zukunft dieser Pflanzen? Schule wird vernachlässigt von Gott, Religion und Tugendwiffen fie so viel wie Nichts und nirgends findet das Sprüchwort: „Müßigang ist aller Laster Anfang" besser Anklang als bei diefen. Arbeiten wollen oder können sie nicht, aus dem einfachen Grunde, weil sie seitens der Eltern nicht Dazu angehalten worden find. Vom Zufluchtshause wandern sie in das während, so kostet das Glas bei gleichen So lange die Masse noch heiß ist, kann man irgend eine Befestigung von Eisen bei Rothgluth in das Glas vor nehmen, welcher Einsatz ganz fest hält, so bald das Eisen und Glas mit einander abgekühlt sind. Die Kosten dieses erweichten Glases sind dem Gewicht nach denen des Gussens gleich. Da aber das specisische Gewicht des Glases nur ein Dritttheil desjenigen von Gussen Dimensionen nur ein Dritttheil dessen, was Gussen kostet. Der Bortheil, mit welchem man Glases statt eiserner Schwellen benutzt, tritt nicht minder auch bei anderer Verwendung hervor. Hier findet kein Rostfraß statt, wie beim Eisen, und kein Faulen, wie beim Holz. Zu Gas-, Wasser-, Drain-Röhre, zu chemischen Zwecken und zahllosen anderen Dingen, wo Festigkeit und Stärke mit Dauerhaftigkeit gepaart von nötten sind, muß dies Glas die besten Dienste leisten. Man darf daher wohl annehmen, dass wir in Zukunft sowohl in gläsernen Häuserji wohnen können, wie man heute bereits über gläsernen Eisenbahnfchwellen dahinfährt, dass wir Wasser ebenso gut aus gläsernen Röhren beziehen, wie man es aus Geschirren von GlaS trinkt, daß wir unter gläsernen Dächern leben, die dem Hagel, wie dem Blitze Widerstand leisten, und ohne uns vor den Steine unserer Feinde furchten zu müssen, und dass wir drei, wenn nicht bis dahin die Leichenverbrennung allgemein wieder eingeführt sein sollte, in gläsernen Särgen unter gläsernes Gewölben beigesetzt werden. So' groß wirbt drei die Universalität des Stoffes werden, welcher bis jetzt noch immer als ein Symbol der Vergänglichkeit gilt. S a a 1 6ltibl|c«crbon Waldorf gehalten.

Wenn ober das Weib eine so heilige und in der Tat auch schwierige Mission zu erfüllen hat, so muß es auch mit denjenigen Kenntnissen und Fertigkeiten ausgerüstet sein, welche ihm die Erfüllung feiner Aufgabe möglichen. Welche find da 1. Bor allen Dingen jene religiöse Bildung, welche die echt weibliche Tugenden der Demuth, Sanftmuth und de« gesellschaftlichen Anstände entspringen. 2. Diejenige Bildung des Geistes, welche das Urteil schärst und die Seeleistung steigert, dann aber auch die Kenntnis aller jener Dinge, welche zur Führung eines geregelten Haufwesen, unentbehrlich find. Im Folgenden wollen wir nun sehen, ob unsere Frauen und Mädchen, vorzüglich die gegenwärtigen, auf diesem Standpunkte stehen und finden wir leider das Gegenteil, was sehr zu befürchten ist, so wollen nur zugleich die Mittel aufsuchen, welche geeignet find, sie auf demselben emporzuheben. Da von wird Manche für alle Klassen der eigentüm Menschen ein Gleichgültigkeit haben doch weise ich schon hier darauf hin, dass ein hauptsächlich für die Töchter unseres Mittelstandes gelten soll. Nach oben und nach unten find die Verhältnisse wesentlich anders, und was dem Bürgermädchen ziemt, paßt nicht in demselben Mäaße für die durch Rang, Reichthum und Geburt bevorzugten. Frauen der höheren Gesellschaft. Werfen wir einen Blick auf das Frauengeschlecht der Gegenwart und vergleichen wir eS mit der Generation unserer Mutter und Großmütter, so können wir einen bemerkenswerten und fast erschreckenden Unterschied unfern Augen nicht verschließen. Nicht dass die Töchter der Gegenwart häßlicher und minder liebreizend geworden wären aber fie haben mehr oder minder daS echte Weibliche verloren, welches nicht allein an der schönen, sondern auch an der häßlichen Frau gefällt. Sie find aus der Refere, in welcher fie fich so lieblich ausnehmen, in die Avantgarde getreten, und greifen, anstatt fich zu verteidigen. Die Rose, welche in den Thätigsten des Morgens aus der Halbgeöffneten Knospe ihren Duft aufstattet, hat sich im sengenden Strahle der Sonne bis auf das letzte Blättern weit erschlossen die Poesie ist dahin. Das Weib ist nicht mehr das bescheidene Veilchen, welches sich mit seinem Wohlgeruche verbirgt es ist zur prunkenden Untergehen, welche mit großen Farben am Wege steht, und die Vorübergehen den einladet, ihre „kalte" Schönheit zu bewundern. Der dominierende Grund zug in den Herzen unserer Frauen ist die Gefallsucht. Allerdings bedarf ihre schwache Natwder kräftigen Stütze des Mannes, und fie können dieser nur teilhaftig werden, wenn fie ihm gefallen aber fie lassen dabei einen wesentlichen Faktor außer Acht. Während fie mit allen möglichen Raffination ihren Körper schmücken und diejenigen schaften ihres Geistes ausbilden, welche einen gewissen Glanz um fie verbreiten, vernachlässigen sie die echt weiblichen fugend. en und werden zu gehaltlosen Schaugestalte, die unmöglich gefallen können, fondern lediglich reizen, nicht die Liebe, fondern nur und allein die bestialische Leidenschaft wachrufen. Das bei dem Mangel an wirklicher Frömigkeit auch eit den anderen weiblichen Tugenden fehlt, versteht sich vor selbst. Diese verkehrte Richtung beginnt in der Regel schon im zartesten Kinde Salter. Die Mutter, selbst von falschen Grundsäßen durchdrungen, oder vielmehr Grundsatzlos den unordentlichen Gelüsten ihres Herzens und die Wogen des modernen Lebensstromes, folgend, hegen und pflegen den Keim der Putzsucht auch in ihrer Töchtern, und et schießt so wuchernd emporium schon bei der ersten hl.

Article: Wesentlich anders liegt aber doch die Sache bei dem schon bearbeiteten Holz, eine Herren. Nach dem über-einstimmenden Urteil aller, die der Sache näher stehen, auf deren Urteil ich ein größeres Gewicht legen möchte als das des Herrn Vorredners, ist in der Tat eine kolossale Vorrathseinfuhr von bearbeiteten Hölzern zu erwarten, wenn der Termin so lange hinausgeschoben wird, wie hier beantragt ist. Meine Herren, der erste Juli, womit wir annehmen, daß der Zolltarif im Mai zu Stande kommt, ist eine Hinausschiebung um etwa 2 Monate, und dazu liegt in der Tat kein Grund vor. Diejenigen von Ihnen, welche wünschen, daß der Zoll bald in Wirksamkeit treten solle, daß nicht auf Monate hinaus die Wirkungen des Zolltarifs gerade rücksichtlich der Verarbeitung des Holzes aufgehalten werden sollen, — die werden, glaube ich, diesem Vorschlage nicht zustimmen können, sondern werden sich dem Vorschlage des Herrn Abgeordneten von Schlieckmann anschließen, daß bezüglich der Nr. 62 und 63 des Tarifs der erhöhte Zoll sofort in Wirksamkeit treten soll. Ich möchte nur hinzufügen, daß von Memel, Ruß und Tilsit die dringendsten Vorstellungen und Bitten eingegangen sind, in dieser Beziehung doch den Vorschlägen der Kommission nicht zustimmen. Diese Interessenten, die an sich gegen Holzzölle sind, fürchten in der Tat eine wesentliche Schädigung ihrer und allgemeiner Interessen, wenn man den Zoll für das schon bearbeitete Holz erst mit dem 1. Juli in Kraft treten läßt. Präsident: Das Wort hat der Herr Abgeordnete Graf zu Stolberg-Wernigerode. Abgeordneter Graf zu Stolberg-Wernigerode: Meinerechte, ich kann mich den sachlichen Gründen, die mein Freund, der Herr Abgeordnete von Schlieckmann, für eine schnellere Einführung des Satzes in Bezug auf die Tarifnummer 13 o 2 und 3 angeführt hat, durchaus nicht verschließen; allein ich möchte Sie bitten, zum mindesten heute von der Annahme eines solchen Antrages Abstand zu nehmen, und zwar mit Rücksicht auf die clausula Windthorst, die dem Sperrgesetz beigefügt worden ist. Meine Herren, soweit ich die Stimmung des Reichstags kenne, würde die Annahme dieses Antrages des Herrn Abgeordneten von Schlieckmann unzweifelhaft die Folge haben, dass die clausula Windthorst auch auf diese Position ausgedehnt werden würde. Das scheint mir persönlich aber außerordentlich bedenklich. Meine Herren, die Einführungstermine für die verschiedenen Positionen des Tarifs stehen ja naturgemäß mit einander im Zusammenhang. Als wir in der Kommission die Fassung dieses H 3 beschlossen, gingen wir von der Ansicht aus, die Holzzölle würden ungefähr zu gleicher Zeit wie die anderen Tarifpositionen — nämlich wie die Tarifpositionen, die jetzt in anderen Kommissionen vorberaten werden — hier zur Berathung kommen, und darum glaubten wir unsererseits, für den Einführungstermin gleich positive Vorschläge machen zu müssen. Nun kommt aber diese Berathung über die Holzzölle viel früher als die Berathung über die anderen Gegenstände. Meine Herren, Sie haben ja den Antrag Ausfeld und alle die hiermit zusammenhängenden Fragen einer besonderen Kommission überwiesen; ich glaube, Sie würden den Beschlüssen Ihrer Kommission präjudizieren, wenn Sie heute diesen Antrag annehmen. Aus diesen Gründen möchte ich Sie bitten, heute von einer Diskussion und Beschlussfassung über den Z 3 Abstand zu nehmen und damit so lange zu warten, bis er entweder nochmals in der Kommission vorberaten ist, oder aber bis im allgemeinen die sämtlichen Tarifpositionen die zweite Lesung hier im Reichstag passiert haben. Präsident: Das Wort hat der Herr Abgeordnete Stiller. Abgeordneter Stiller: Meine Herren, in der Kommission sind damals über diesen Punkt eingehende Erwägungen und Erörterungen gepflogen worden, und die haben uns zu den Resultaten gebracht, wie eben die Beschlüsse der Kommission sie jetzt vor Sie hinstellen. Nach allem, was man bisher eingezogen hat von den in Frage kommenden fachmännischen und kaufmännischen Kreisen, hat man sich an die Idee gewöhnt, dass behaupte und gesägte Ware bis zum 1. Juli, die rohe Ware dagegen bis 1. Oktober auf Grund des alten Zolltarifs eingeführt werden könnte. Man hat sich damit zufrieden gegeben, und ich muß gestehen im Gegensatz zu den Ausführungen des Herrn Grafen Stolberg, dass gerade in derjenigen Kommission, die jetzt mit der Ausarbeitung des Sperrgesetzes sich zu befassen hat, eine gewisse Beruhigung obgewaltet hat in Hinsicht gerade auf diese für das Holzzollgesetz getroffene Bestimmung. Ich glaube, es würde so ziemlich nach allen Seiten hin billiger scheinen und den Ansprüchen an Billigkeit entsprechen, wenn wir diesen Termin bestehen lassen wollten, auch schon aus dem Grund, weil diese Artikeln, welche in dieser Hinsicht hervorragen, gehören auch die Asbesthandschuhe. Meine Herren, die Asbesthandschuhe sind sehr wertvoll für solche Arbeiter an Hochöfen und in Gießereien, welche dem Einfluss einer ganz außergewöhnlichen Hitze ausgesetzt sind. Nun, meine Herren, Sie sehen, ein Handschuh dieser Art kann nicht gerade Anspruch auf Eleganz erheben; nach dem heutigen Zolltarif wird dieser Artikel nichtsdestoweniger mit 300 Mark unter der Position Kleider und Putzwaaren verzollt. (Heiterkeit.) Neben den Handschuhen spielen eine hervorragende Rolle die Masken von Asbest und schließlich ganze Anzüge von Asbest, und es gibt, Gott sei Dank, bereits in Deutschland manche große Etablissements, welche Veranlassung genommen haben, für ihre am meisten exponirten Arbeiter solche Asbestanzüge und Asbesthandschuhe anzuschaffen. Auf der letzten Hygieneausstellung, hier in Berlin befanden sich in jener Galerie, welche einen Überblick gab über die Fortschritte, die auf hygienischem Gebiete getroffen sind zum Schutz der Gesundheit der Arbeiter, auch jene Handschuhe und jene Kleidungsstücke, welche aus Asbest produziert werden. Es handelt sich in diesem Falle ganz ausdrücklich um einen Stoff, der wie kein anderer die Möglichkeit bietet, selbst bei sehr exponirten Stellen dem Arbeiter einen wesentlichen Schutz gegen den Einfluß außerordentlicher Hitze zu gewähren. Die Asbestgewebe finden aber noch bei vielen anderen Dingen Verwendung; so werden z. B. aus Asbestgeweben die Überzüge für Boote hergestellt, insbesondere auch auf Kriegsschiffen; denn da das Asbestgewebe, wie gesagt, unverbrennlich ist, so bietet es auch einen Schutz gegen die Feuersgefahr, welche durch Funken u. s. w., welche aus den Schornsteinen der Dampfer heraussteigen, entstehen könnte. Meine Herren, Asbest ist eben in ganz eminenter Weise ein Artikel, dessen ausgedehnte Benutzung tatsächlich einen ökonomischen und hygienischen Fortschritt bedeutet, und diese Rücksicht, meine Herren, müssen wir bei Bemessung des Zollsatzes in den Vordergrund stellen, in den Vordergrund stellen trotz aller derjenigen Interessen, welche die beiden bestehenden Asbestwaarenfabriken repräsentieren. Nun spielt ja bei Asbestwaaren die Qualität eine ganz besondere Rolle, und die Petenten lasten es sich auch angelegen sein, die fremden Produkte in ihrer Qualität herabzusetzen. Nun, meine Herren, ich glaube, hier im Hause sind manche anwesend, welche in ihren industriellen Etablissements ebenfalls Asbestartikel verwenden. Ich selbst kann nur nach den mir vorliegenden Angaben auf das bestimmteste versichern, dass auch heute noch in den wesentlichsten Artikeln die fremden Produkte wesentlich teurer sind als die deutschen Produkte. Man kann diese Asbestpappe heute in Deutschland, in deutscher Waare zu zirka 90 bis 100 Mark pro Doppelzentner kaufen, während man die englische Waare nicht unter 120 Mark erhalten kann. In ganz ähnlichem Verhältnis stehen die Preise bei den Asbestgarnen, welche ebenfalls zur Dichtung von Dampfleitungen dienen, ferner bei den Asbestgeweben. Bei den Asbestgeweben kommen in Betracht die Gewebe aus reinem Asbest, sodann die mit Baumwolle gemischten Gewebe. Die Asbestgewebe haben ja schon früher die Rolle einer Kuriosität gespielt, und man erzählt, daß Kaiser Karl V. ein Tischtuch von Asbest besessen habe, welches nach vollbrachter Mahlzeit zum Ergötzen der Tischgenossen in den Kamin geworfen wurde, da das Ausbrennen die Unreinlichkeit bequemer beseitigte als das Waschen. Nun, meine Herren, gerade diese Stoffe dienen zu den Zwecken, von denen ich vorhin gesprochen habe. Überall da, wo es darauf ankommt, einen Schutz für Menschen oder maschinelle Einrichtungen zu treffen, bedeutet die Anwendung des Asbests einen großen Fortschritt. Bisher hat man sich an solchen Stellen begnügen müssen, statt der Asbestpappe gewöhnliche Pappe zu verwenden, und bei der Anwendung von durch die Hitze so leicht angreifbaren Stoffen wie der gewöhnlichen Pappe war die notwendige Folge, dass häufig eine Erneuerung notwendig war, andererseits, dass auch eine gewisse Feuergefahr vorhanden war. Überall, wo Asbest an Stelle anderer Stoffe tritt, bedeutet es einen wesentlichen Fortschritt in ökonomischer und hygienischer Hinsicht. Und, meine Herren, wenn Sie sich nun das vergegenwärtigen bei der Betrachtung der vorliegenden Frage, so meinen, dass wir bei Bemessung des Zollsatzes nicht über ein verständiges, bescheidenes Maß hinausgehen dürfen. Wir müssen uns gegenwärtig halten, dass es darauf ankommt, die weitere Anwendung des Asbests nicht durch irgend welche weitgehende Vertheilung desselben, nicht zu Gunsten einiger weniger Fabrikanten zu hemmen, sondern dass es recht eigentlich im Interesse unserer Industrie wie im Interesse unserer Arbeiter ist, die Verwendung von Asbestwaaren in möglichstem Umfange zu fördern. Dazu ist das beste Mittel, dass diese Asbestartikel vor jeder weiteren Vertheilung bewahrt bleiben. Diesen Zweck, meine Herren, sucht mein Antrag zu erreichen, indem er zugleich in einer, wie mir scheint, sehr entgegenkommenden Weise auch den Wünschen der Asbestfabrikanten Rechnung zu tragen sucht. Freilich, meine Herren, wenn jene Fabrikanten kommen und den Anspruch erheben, dass auf die Asbestpappe, welche heute einen Wert von 90 bis 100 Mark pro Doppelzentner hat, ein Zoll von 100 Mark gelegt werden, so verlieren sie eigentlich allen Anspruch auf Glaubwürdigkeit. Wenn sie mit solchen Ansprüchen hervortreten, welche gerade einen wichtigen Fortschritt empfindlich hindern würden, so gibt es darauf keine andere Antwort als eine schroffe Abweisung. Ich weiß nicht, ob ich richtig thue, meine Zollsätze im einzelnen gleich zu begründen. - Da mir dies bestätigt wird, möchte ich also zurückgreifen auf den wichtigsten Artikel, die Asbestpappe. Für diese schlägt mein Antrag, wie gesagt, eine Verfünffachung des bestehenden Zolls vor. In Übereinstimmung mit der Regierung wird dabei der gleiche Zollsatz beantragt, sowohl für Asbestpappe wie für Asbestpapier. Das letztere findet nur in geringem Umfang Verwendung und spielt auch bei dem Import nur eine sehr untergeordnete Rolle. Das Formen der Asbestpappe ist nur eine kleine Arbeit, die auch ein ungeübter Arbeiter ohne Umstände vornehmen kann. Ich habe deshalb auch von einem weitgehenden Zollschutz für das Formen abgesehen und Ihnen vorgeschlagen, dem Zollsatz für Pappe von 5 Mark einen Zollsatz von 8 Mark für die geformte gegenüberzustellen. Eine hervorragende Rolle neben der Pappe spielen vor allen Dingen die Garne, welche zu gleichen Zwecken, nämlich zum Dichten dienen. Für diese Garne habe ich in gleicher Weise, etwa mit demselben Prozentsatz wie für Pappe, einen Zoll zu schaffen gesucht. Auch wenn wir die übrigen Sätze für Garne und Schnüre in unserem Tarife ansehen, so muß man sich sagen, dass bei dem heutigen Preis für diese Asbestgarne von etwa 240 Mark pro 100 Kilogramm der von mir vorgeschlagene Zollsatz ein durchaus angemessener ist. Von großer Wichtigkeit ist es dabei, dass neben diesen eigentlichen Garnen auch diejenigen Gewebe berücksichtigt werden, welche in Form von Schnüren eine Talkfüllung haben und in ganz besonderem Umfang Verwendung finden. Der Wert dieser Artikel ist noch 15 Prozent niedriger als der der eigentlichen Garne, so dass der vorgeschlagene Zoll auch für diese völlig ausreichend wäre. Endlich kommt der letzte Artikel, die Asbestgewebe, Asbesthandschuhe und dergleichen. Meine Herren, für diese Artikel bestand zum Teil ein sehr niedriger Zoll, für die Asbestgewebe, den Hauptartikel, nur ein Zoll von 3 Mark. Mein Antrag will auch diesen Zoll auf 24 Mark erhöhen in Rücksicht auf den vorgeschlagenen Zollsatz für Asbestgarne. Dagegen scheinen mir die Zollsätze der Regierungsvorlage 1751 Reich, und die Innungsmeister werden zum allergrößten Theile selber sagen: wie konnten wir nur eines Tages so einfältig sein und glauben, daß uns mit Innungen noch geholfen werden könnte gegenüber dieser großartigen kapitalistischen Entwicklung? (Lachen rechts.) Heute bereits sind in den Innungskreisen selbst bedeutende Bedenken. Ich habe in diesen Kreisen auch meine Fühlung; ich habe da eine Menge von Leuten im Laufe der letzten Zeit gesprochen, die sagen: ja, wir fangen doch allmählich an, einzusehen, daß wir uns etwas sehr getäuscht haben über die Wirkung dieser Innungen und die Möglichkeit des Eingreifens in die ganze soziale Organisation der heutigen Gesellschaft, in die Erwerbsverhältnisse, insbesondere in die Konkurrenz- verhältnisse. Wir können weder in Bezug auf die Arbeits- verhältnisse noch in Bezug auf die Preise den gewünschten Einfluss ausüben. Wenn Sie nun, meine Herren, den Innungsmeistern nicht die Garantie und die Mittel bieten können, daß sie mit Hilfe ihrer Innungen sich eine höhere Lebenshaltung zu erwerben vermögen, daß ihre Arbeiten besser bezahlt werden, ihr Verdienst und die Sicherheit ihrer Lebensstellung größer wird, — dann, meine Herren, ist die ganze Innungs einfach ein Brimborium, sie ist nicht das Papier werth, auf dem die Statuten geschrieben sind. Wo die Berufsgenossenschaften bleiben, fragt weiter Herr Dr. Hartmann, wenn unsere Organisation durchgeführt werde. Ja, da hat er sich, wie mir scheint, mit der Sache gar nicht genauer beschäftigt; so weit mein Verständnis von der Sache reicht, hat unser Antrag und die Organisation, wenn dieselbe durchgeführt ist, mit den Berufsgenossenschaften gar nichts zu schaffen; die haben ein wesentlich anderes Gebiet ihrer Tätigkeit als die Arbeitsräte, Arbeitsämter und Arbeitskammern, die wir Ihnen vorschlagen. Die aus den Berufsgenossenschaften hervorgehenden Schiedsgerichte, die sich mit den Streitigkeiten beschäftigen, die aus der Unfallversicherung resultieren, haben auch nicht das allermindesten gemeinsam mit denen, die wir vorschlagen. Die ganzen Ausführungen, die der Abgeordnete Dr. Hartmann in diesen Punkten gemacht hat, waren eben vollkommen deplaziert. „Sie wollen den § 100 der Gewerbeordnung", sagt der Abgeordnete Dr. Hartmann weiter, „den wir erst nach so langer Zeit, mit so unendlicher Mühe durchgebracht haben, aufheben." Das dürfen wir Ihnen doch nicht zutrauen, daß sie den jetzt leichtfertig preisgaben; den würden sie bis aufs äußerste verteidigen. Ach, meine Herren, darüber haben wir uns auch nie im geringsten getäuscht. Glauben Sie, wir hätten erwartet, bei unserem Organisationsentwurf in Ihnen (rechts) Bundesgenossen zu finden? (Zurufe rechts: Wenn denn!) Meine Herren, wir nehmen die Bundesgenossen, woher sie kommen, das ist uns ganz gleichgültig, aber daß wir sie bei Ihnen finden sollten, überrascht mich etwas, in diesem Fall am allermeisten. (Lachen rechts.) Und außerdem, meine Herren, wenn wir die Bundesgenossen nehmen, woher sie kommen, so werden wir der Bundesgenossen halber, des seien Sie versichert, keine Konzessionen machen. (Zuruf rechts: Na! na!) Nein, wir machen keine Konzessionen. Wollen Sie unsere Bundesgenossen sein, dann müssen Sie akzeptieren, was wir vorschlagen. (Sehr gut! und große Heiterkeit rechts.) Meine Herren, wenn nicht, nicht! sage ich Ihnen. (Zurufe.) Und dann noch eins: glauben Sie denn, daß der Wind aus der konservativen Ecke ewig weht? Ich nicht; der kann einmal rasch sich ändern und wird sich rasch ändern, verlassen Sie sich darauf! (Zuruf.) Unser Wind hat noch nicht geweht, aber der kommt auch, und dann wird es möglicherweise ein Sturm. Also auf die Annäherung, auf die der Herr Dr. Hartmann gerechnet hat, kann ich zu meinem Bedauern nicht eingehen. Er hat dann auch die Gefährlichkeit der Arbeitskammern damit darzulegen versucht, dass er darauf hinwies, was daraus entstehen könnte, wenn einmal unruhige Zeiten eintraten, dass dann leicht die Perspektive auf die Laterne für die Arbeitgeber käme. Meine Herren, ich glaube, wir machen hier Gesetze für die Zeiten der Ruhe, die doch wohl die Regel sind; wenn stürmische Zeiten kommen, revolutionäre Zeiten, wie ich nach den Worten des Herrn Abgeordneten Dr. Hartmann annehmen muss, — ja, meine Herren, dann ist sehr möglich, dass alsdann nicht allein die Arbeitskammern, sondern noch gar vieles andere von den aufgeregten Massen in ihrem Sinne beeinflusst wird. Vorläufig sind wir noch nicht so weit, darüber haben wir uns also auch die Köpfe noch nicht zu zerbrechen, und ich meine, dass das wenigstens keine Gesichtspunkte sind, von denen man heute schon Gesetzgebung macht. Brechen wirklich revolutionäre Unruhen aus, die nicht siegreich sind, so steht der Perspektive auf die Laterne, welche die Arbeitgeber nach Herrn Dr. Hartmann haben sollen, die Perspektive auf den Staatsanwalt für die Arbeiter gegenüber, und in dieser Rolle wird Herr Dr. Hartmann, wie ich wohl annehmen darf, wohl seinen Mann zu stellen wissen. (Heiterkeit links.) Also kann er nach dieser Seite hin ebenfalls vollkommen ruhig sein. Er hat dann auch seine großen Bedenken gegen den Minimallohn ausgesprochen, in dem er eine ganz besonders radikale Forderung sah. Nun, ich will Ihnen ganz offen aussprechen — denn es ist ja kein Geheimnis —: über diese Forderung sind in der Sozialdemokratie selbst die Meinungen unterschiedlich. Die einen meinen, die Sache sei durchführbar, die anderen bestreiten dies. Man hat ganz einfach gesagt: man lasse es einmal auf die Probe ankommen; wir werden ja sehen, wie weit wir kommen; wir schaffen da eine neue Einrichtung, — sehen wir, daß sie sich erprobt, dann ist sie gut; erprobt sie sich nicht, dann schaffen wir sie wieder ab. Herr Dr. Hartmann und seine Freunde dürften jedenfalls die ersten sein, die im letzteren Falle bereit wären, mit den bezüglichen Anträgen zu kommen. Jedenfalls also, meine Herren, glaube ich, daß, wenn Sie wirklich eine umfassende gründliche Sozialreform wollen. Sie auch eine Organisation, wie wir sie — wobei ich ja auf Nebendinge und Abänderungen im Kleinen kein Gewicht lege — Ihnen vorgeschlagen haben, in der Hauptsache akzeptiren müssen. Es gibt nach meiner und meiner Freunde reiflichster Erwägung, da wir wahrhaftig, wie ich glaube, die Verhältnisse praktisch kennen, kaum einen anderen Ausweg dafür. Und daß wir in diesen Kammern Arbeiter und Arbeitgeber zusammen wirken lassen, — nun, ich meine, das dürfte Ihnen auch zur Genüge zeigen, daß wir wenigstens für alle die Fragen, die auf dem Boden der heutigen bürgerlichen Gesellschaft entschieden werden können, auch von der Ansicht ausgehen: hier ist eine Verständigung zwischen den beiden streitenden Klassen, was auf der einen Seite die Arbeiterklasse, auf der anderen die Unternehmerklasse ist, notwendig. Es ist notwendig, daß sie da in den bezüglichen Körperschaften, wo alle Fragen erörtert werden, zusammentreten und sich gegenseitig verständigen und durch ihre schließliche Abstimmung dokumentieren, nach welcher Seite hin sie die Dinge geordnet sehen möchten. 242 2006 Reichstag. — 73. Sitzung. Sonnabend den 21. März 1885. brachen werden, sondern wir können nur Beschlüsse fassen, welche unseren prinzipiellen Standpunkt demjenigen der Regierung gegenüber wahren. Das haben wir getan, und das müssen wir auch jetzt, meine Herren; denn sonst würde im nächsten Jahre gewiß, namentlich nach dem, was der Herr Kriegsminister heute gesagt hat, der Vertreter der Bundesregierungen kommen und sagen, wir seien von unserem Standpunkt zurückgetreten, wir hätten also das anerkannt, was die Regierung wollte. Im übrigen will ich nur für mich, wie schon damals in der Debatte, erklären, dass, so lange ich Mitglied der Rechnungskommission gewesen bin, — und dass alle Rechnungen seit 1867 bis vor wenigen Jahren durch meine Hände gegangen, — wir prinzipieller niemals den Standpunkt der Regierung als den richtigen anerkannt haben. Ich würde dem Herrn Kriegsminister bitten, dass er die Sache nicht auf die Spitze treibt und uns geradezu zwingt, Konsequenzen aus seiner Theorie zu ziehen, die schließlich lediglich bei der Verweigerung der Decharge anlangen müßten. Wenn wir das bisher nicht getan haben, so haben wir damit eben bekundet, dass wir den prinzipiellen Standpunkt zwar aufrecht erhalten wollen, in keiner Weise uns etwas vergeben wollen, dass wir aber für jetzt die gesetzliche Lösung in unserem Sinne nicht erzwingen wollen. Eine jede Provokation in dem Sinne, wie der Herr Kriegsminister sie heute beliebt hat, zwingt uns, aus der Reserve noch mehr herauszutreten, und wir würden bei dem Mittel, welches zulässig und wahrhaftig doch verfassungsmäßig ist — das würde der Herr Kriegsminister doch anerkennen —, bei dem Mittel der Dechargeverweigerung ankommen müssen. Präsident: Das Wort hat der Herr Abgeordnete von Helldorff. Abgeordneter von Helldorff: Meine Herren, ich möchte nur darum bitten, dass über die Nr. 1 gesondert abgestimmt wird, weil wir gegen die Nr. 1, in der sich das Vorgehen der Herren, für die Herr Rickert gesprochen hat, ausdrücklich stimmen wollen und zwar in Konsequenz unserer Anseinandersetzung in der letzten Sitzung, in der wir diesen Gegenstand verhandelt haben. Ich enthalte mich, hier nochmals auf die Debatte einzugehen, wenn ich nicht von der anderen Seite dazu provoziert werde. Das aber muss ich nun nochmals konstatieren, daß unsere Seite die Auffassung des Herrn Rickert in dieser Beziehung nicht teilt. Wir sind nicht der Meinung, dass wir in dieser Allgemeinheit das Recht des Reichstags in Anspruch nehmen dürfen, weil wir glauben, dass es ihm in dieser Allgemeinheit nicht zusteht, und wir glauben, dass die Form, welche die Herren wählen, weher thut, als wir meinen in dieser Sache zu tun zu sollen. Präsident: Der Herr Abgeordnete IN-. Meyer (Halle) hat das Wort. Abgeordneter Dr. Meyer (Halle): Ja, meine Herren, wenn die Herren von der konservativen Partei gegen den von uns unter I formulirten Antrag, also gegen die Nr. 18 stimmen, wie es den Anschein hat, und wenn sie, was ich allerdings nicht erwarte, bei dieser Ablehnung die Majorität erhalten sollten, dann würde der Reichstag eben in die Lage kommen, über unseren Eventualantrag unter II ebenfalls abzustimmen, welcher Antrag dahin geht, die Decharge nur auszusprechen unter dem Vorbehalt derjenigen Fälle, die unter diesen Nummern aufgeführt sind, das heißt also, für diese Position die Decharge irsus suspendieren zu lassen, und wir würden diesen Antrag alsdann damit zu motivieren haben, dass Ausgaben geleistet sind, die nach der strengen Handhabung der bestehenden Anordnungen nicht hätten geleistet werden sollen, und für welche auch die nachträgliche Genehmigung, die wir bereitwillig angeboten haben, durch die Schuld der konservativen Partei vereitelt worden wäre. Präsident: Der Herr Bevollmächtigte zum Bundesrat, Staats- und Kriegsminister Bronsart von Schellendorf, hat das Wort. Bevollmächtigter zum Bundesrat für das Königreich Preußen, Staats- und Kriegsminister Bronsart von Schellendorf: Meine Herren, ich muß meinen Vergleich mit dem Waffenstillstand aufrecht erhalten. Ich habe ja vollständig anerkannt, dass die Frage, um die es sich hier handelt, zwischen dem Reichstag und den Regierungen kontrovers ist seit Jahren; aber es wird doch auch andererseits nicht bestritten werden wollen, dass diese Form der nachträglichen Genehmigung bisher weder im Plenum beantragt worden, noch jemals seitens des Plenums beliebt worden ist, dass also allerdings eine Verschärfung der Situation eingetreten ist, nicht durch die Initiative der verbündeten Regierungen, sondern durch eine Initiative aus dem Hause heraus. Darum halte ich den Vergleich vollständig aufrecht, dass wir uns, so weit hier die Plenarberatungen in Frage kommen, auf diesem Gebiete im Zustand des Waffenstillstands befounden haben. Dass in den Kommissionen diese Sachen erörtert worden sind, dass auch dem Gedanken Ausdruck gegeben worden ist, dass Seine Majestät nicht das Recht hätte, derartige Niederschlagungsordners zu erteilen, das ist mir sehr wohl bekannt. Es ist aber nicht in dieser Form und Bestimmtheit zum Ausdruck gebracht worden. Diese Frage ist auch nicht, — es ist mehrfach hier der Ausdruck gefallen in früheren Debatten: „provokirende Erklärungen des Kriegsministers" — diese Frage ist nicht von dem preußischen Kriegsminister aufgerührt worden, sondern sie ist in das Plenum gebracht worden durch den Herrn Antragsteller und seine Partei, welche die Gelegenheit für gekommen glaubt, um nun einmal bestimmt auch im Plenum ihren Auffassungen Ausdruck zu geben und durch einen Majoritätsbeschluss auf die Entschließungen der verbündeten Regierungen einzuwirken. Meine Herren, der Herr Abgeordnete Rickert sagt, es wären Konsequenzen nöthigenfalls zu ziehen, wenn die verbündeten Regierungen hier sich den Anträgen entgegenstellten. Ja, meine Herren, die Konsequenzen, die sich aus der Annahme des Antrages ergeben, die ziehe ich auch, und das sind nämlich die, dass, wenn Sie heute in sehr versöhnlicher Stimmung diese Ausgaben nachträglich genehmigen, Sie viel leicht einstmal in einer weniger versöhnlichen Stimmung die Ausgaben nachträglich nicht genehmigen; dann stehen wir vor der Frage, dass Seine Majestät der König von Preußen in der loyalsten Ausübung des ihm nach Ansicht der verbündeten Regierungen zustehenden Rechtes eine Order gegeben hat, einen Befehl an die Armee, dass dessen Ausführung nachher gewissermaßen durch einen Beschluss des Reichstages als ungesetzlich und als unzulässig erklärt wird. Diese Konsequenz, meine Herren, wollen wir uns nicht aussetzen. (Bravo! rechts.) Präsident: Das Wort hat der Herr Abgeordnete Dr. Hänel. Abgeordneter Dr. Hänel: Meine Herren, ich operiere weder mit Bildern noch mit Stimmungen. Ich kann natürlich dem Herrn Kriegsminister nicht verwehren, ein Bild, ob richtig oder unrichtig, zu gebrauchen; aber er muss mir auf der anderen Seite zugestehen, dass mit derartigen Bildern für logische, für rechtliche Deduktionen auch nichts gewonnen wird. Sehen wir die Sache an, wie sie tatsächlich liegt. Richtig ist es, dass die Rechnungskommission, beachtlich das Haus über eine Unzahl von ähnlichen Notaten aus dem Hause kein Widerspruch erfolgt. Die Resolution des Herrn Abgeordneten Dr. Baumbach, Nr. 3, lautet: den Bundesrat zu ersuchen, im nächsten Reichshaushaltsetat die zur Besoldung der Postsekretäre bestimmte Summe insoweit zu erhöhen, als dies erforderlich ist, um die derzeitige Schmälerung zu besichtigen, welche die Mittel zur Besoldung der Postsekretäre dadurch erleiden, dass sie mit denjenigen übertragen, welche zur Besoldung der in Tit. 18 bezeichneten höheren Beamtenkategorien, sowie zur Besoldung der Kassierer und Obersekretäre bestimmt sind. Ich werde also zunächst über diese Resolution und für den Fall, dass dieselbe abgelehnt werden sollte, über die Resolution unter Nr. 2 abstimmen lassen. Sollte die Resolution unter Nr. 3 angenommen werden, so ist die Resolution unter Nr. 2 erledigt. — Das Haus ist damit einverstanden. Ich bitte diejenigen Herren, welche die Resolution unter Nr. 3 annehmen wollen, sich zu erheben. (Geschieht.) Das ist die Mehrheit; die Resolution 2 ist damit erledigt. Zu Kap. 3 Tit. 17, — gestellt von dem Herrn Abgeordneten Dr. Lingens: a) die Grundsätze über die Feststellung der Gehaltsstufen für die verschiedenen Beamtenkategorien in der Richtung einer Revision unterwerfen zu lassen, dass ein regelmäßiges Vorrücken der Beamten nach der Anciennität gesichert werden; b) die Grundsätze über Regelung und Berechnung der Dienstzeit bei Tag und Nacht gleichmäßig feststellen, sowie dahin ändern zu lassen, dass die Stunden der Sonntagsruhe bei der Berechnung der Gesamt-arbeitszeit der Wochentage nicht in Ansatz kommen. Ich bitte, dass diejenigen Herren, welche diese Resolution annehmen wollen, sich erheben. (Geschieht.) Ich bitte um die Gegenprobe. (Geschieht.) Das Büreau ist einig, dass die jetzt Stehenden die Minderheit sind; die Resolution ist daher angenommen. Wir gehen über zu dem bereits verlesenen, von dem Herrn Abgeordneten Dr. Freiherrn Schenk von Stauffenberg gestellten Antrag. Es wird gewünscht, diesen Antrag als schnellsten im Sinne unserer Geschäftsordnung zu behandeln. Wenn niemand widerspricht, können wir sofort in die Diskussion treten. — Ein Widerspruch erfolgt nicht; ich konstatiere dies und eröffne daher die Diskussion über den Antrag. Das Wort hat der Herr Abgeordnete Freiherr Schenk von Stauffenberg. Abgeordneter Freiherr Schenk von Stauffenberg: Meine Herren, ich will nur sehr wenige Worte zur Begründung der Resolution sagen. Ich glaube, die jetzt durch Gewohnheit festgestellte Behandlung der Resolutionen entspricht wirklich nicht der allgemeinen Stimmung des Hauses. Wir diskutieren in zweiter Lesung schon sehr lange über die Resolutionen, ohne ein praktisches Ergebnis danach herzubringen, und in dritter Lesung kommen sodann die Resolutionen sozusagen erst einmal zur Abstimmung. Ich muss sagen, es ist nicht leicht möglich, sich den Verhandlungen zu vergegenwärtigen, welche den Resolutionen zu Grunde gelegt sind. Ein weiterer Umstand, der auch nicht gerade zur Beschleunigung unserer Debatten beiträgt, ist der, daß niemand, obwohl in dritter Lesung über die Resolutionen nicht mehr diskutiert werden kann, abgehalten werden kann, das, was er zu einer Resolution sagen will, bei irgend einer Gelegenheit beim Etat zur Sprache zu bringen, wie Herr von Benda an einer Reihe von Beispielen gezeigt hat. So kommen also die Resolutionen vielfach zu einer zweimaligen Verhandlung, was eigentlich ganz gegen den Geist der Geschäftsordnung ist. Ich halte es daher für recht nothwendig, daß in dieser Beziehung eine ganz feste Übung festgestellt wird; und es wird das kaum anders möglich sein, als wenn Vorschläge bezüglich eines Zusatzes zur Geschäftsordnung gemacht werden. Ich bemerke aber, — selbstverständlich ist das jetzt nicht nötig, denn wir sind fertig mit den Resolutionen, — daß sich das auf die Zukunft und nicht auf die Gegenwart bezieht. Präsident: Das Wort hat der Herr Abgeordnete von Benda. Abgeordneter von Benda: Ich habe mich bereits früher in demselben Sinne und in derselben Richtung hier ausgesprochen; ich kann dem Herrn Vorredner nur beitreten. Präsident: Das Wort wird nicht weiter verlangt; ich schließe die Diskussion. Wir werden sofort über den Antrag abzustimmen haben. Es dürfte ein Bedenken nicht vorliegen, über diesen Antrag, der einen Auftrag für die Geschäftsordnungskommission enthält, ohne daß derselbe gedruckt vorliegt, sofort abzustimmen. Ich werde den Antrag nochmals verlesen. Er lautet: Die Geschäftsordnungskommission wird beauftragt, die Frage, wie die Resolutionen zum Etat künftig geschäftsordnungsmäßig zu behandeln seien, zu prüfen und darüber dem Reichstage Bericht zu erstatten. Ich bitte diejenigen Herren, welche den Antrag annehmen wollen, sich zu erheben.. (Geschieht.) Das ist die Mehrheit. Meine Herren, im Laufe der Etatsberathung ist seitens der Referenten der Petitionskommission bzw. der Budgetkommission über Petitionen Bericht erstattet, und an dem der Antrag geknüpft worden, dieselben mit Rücksicht auf die zum Etat vom Hause zu fassenden Beschlüsse für erledigt zu erklären. Ich habe mich nicht in der Lage befunden, eine Beschlussfassung des Hauses über diese Anträge der gedachten Kommissionen herbeizuführen, weil Anträge der Kommissionen in geschäftsordnungsmäßiger Form nicht vorliegen, und diese Petitionen deshalb auch nicht auf die Tagesordnung gesetzt werden konnten. Ich glaube auch jetzt einen desfallsigen Beschluss nur dann herbeizuführen zu können, wenn von keiner Seite im Hause dagegen Widerspruch erhoben wird. Da aber seitens der Petitionskommission Wert darauf gelegt wird, dass ein desfallsiger Beschluss gefasst werden möchte, und ich ersucht worden bin, in diesem Sinne die Angelegenheit hier zur Sprache zu bringen, so möchte ich die Frage an das Haus richten, ob Widerspruch dagegen erhoben wird, dass die fraglichen Anträge jetzt zur Abstimmung gestellt werden. — Das ist nicht der Fall. Ich darf dann wohl ohne besondere Abstimmung feststellen, dass das Haus in dieser Beziehung den Anträgen der Petitionskommission respektive der Budgetkommission zustimmt. — Ich stelle das hiermit fest. Meine Herren, die Etatsberathung ist hiermit erledigt. Der Abgeordnete Richter hat den Antrag auf Verzögerung gestellt. Ich bitte diejenigen Herren, welche diesen Antrag unterstützen wollen, sich zu erheben. (Geschieht.) Die Unterstützung reicht aus. Ich bitte diejenigen Herren, welche die Sitzung jetzt verzögern wollen, aufzustehen. (Geschieht.) Reichstag. 63. Sitzung. Dienstag den 10. März 1885. Dann unter der Ziffer 5 schlagen wir Abänderungen der Strafbestimmungen vor. Man hat uns vorgeworfen, als es sich um Ziffer 3 zu Z 100 handelte, dass wir diese Ziffer nicht unter die Strafbestimmungen gestellt hätten. Man hat gemeint, das sei ein glänzender Beweis unserer Unfähigkeit zu legislativer Arbeit. (Sehr richtig! Links.) — Ja, Sie sagen: Sehr richtig! Ich weiß nicht, wer das gerufen hat; er hat aber in den Gesetzen der Einzelstaaten sich gewiß nicht umgesehen; sonst würde er wissen, daß eine gesetzliche Bestimmung, auch wenn nicht in dem Gesetz eine besondere Strafe angedroht ist, darum doch immer Gesetz bleibt, daß sie darum nicht eine Isx impsrlsata ist, und daß die Verwaltungs- und Polizeibehörden gehalten sind, wothigen- falls durch Zwangsmaßregeln auch solche Bestimmungen durch­ zuführen. (Sehr richtig! Rechts.) Zum Überfluß haben sogar einzelne Staaten das ausdrücklich durch Landesgesetz ausgesprochen; aber auch, wo dies nicht der Fall, ist im Verwaltungsrecht ein allgemein anerkannter Grundsatz, daß die Behörden gesetzliche Vorschriften durch­ führen müssen, unbekümmert darum, ob im Gesetze Strafen angedroht sind oder nicht. Ich gebe also zu: eine Strafbestimmung hätte man ja bei Ziffer 3 zu Z 100 s auch mit in das Gesetz aufnehmen können; aber wenn das nicht geschehen ist, so hat man nicht ein so schweres Verbrechen begangen, wie dasjenige ist, dessen wir angeklagt worden. Nun genug aber, Sie wollten durch­ aus eine Strafbestimmung haben, schön, so bringen wir sie Ihnen heute nachträglich, und weil wir einmal, um Ihren Wünschen Rechnung zu tragen, einen Antrag einbringen mußten, so haben wir noch einiges andere mitaufgenommen und beantragen nun alles das, was ich Ihnen des weiteren bereits vorgetragen habe, und worüber Sie nun zu befinden haben. Sie sehen also: wir sind sehr entgegenkommend. Was die geschäftliche Behandlung anlangt, so glaube ich allerdings, unser Antrag bedarf der kommissarischen Vorberatung, und ich beantrage darum in Übereinstimmung mit meinen Herren Mitantragstellern, unseren Antrag zu überweisen an eine besondere Kommission von 21 Mitgliedern. Ich kann nicht empfehlen, dass dieser Antrag überwiesen wird an die X. Kommission, weil die letztere zwar auch mit Bestimmungen aus dem Gebiete der Gewerbeordnung sich befaßt, aber mit einer ganz und ganz anderen Materie. Die X. Kommission beschäftigt sich nach dem ihr bis jetzt überwiesenen Material mit der Frage über den Arbeiterschutz, während unsere heute zur Debatte stehenden Anträge es in der Haupt­sache mit den Innungen zu tun haben. Dies ist etwas ganz anderes. Dazu kommt, dass die X. Kommission so sehr überlastet ist, dass sie Mühe und Not haben wird, um nur die Aufgaben, die ihr bis jetzt schon gestellt sind, zu bewältigen. Ich glaube darum: es ist richtiger, dass für die heutigen Anträge eine besondere Kommission eingesetzt werden. Welchen Bericht die Kommission uns erstatten wird, das weiß ich nicht. Ich hoffe aber, sie kann sich schlüssig machen; jedoch selbst wenn die Session zu kurz sein sollte, um die Arbeit ganz zum Abschluss zu bringen, so wäre schon die Vorberatung über unsere Anträge in einer Kommission von Nutzen. Sie werden ein brauchbares Resultat für weitere Arbeiten liefern. Wir haben das bei verschiedenen großen Gesetzen erlebt, dass es in einer Session noch nicht ganz gegangen ist. Die Kommission hat die Frage geklärt, hat gehört, was die Regierungen dazu sagen, und man ist dann in der nächsten Session wiedergekommen. Wir haben auf dem Gebiete der Gewerbeordnung überhaupt das schon mehrere Male versucht. (Sehr richtig! rechts.) Wir sind in der einen Session nicht fertig geworden, dann sind wir in der nächsten Session wiedergekommen, und dann hatte die Opposition an Kraft verloren, und wir konnten unsere Anträge durchbringen. Darauf dürfen Sie sich ver­ lassen, daß wir nicht eher zurücktreten, als bis die Forderungen erfüllt sind, die das deutsche Handwerk, wie wir glauben, mit Recht stellen kann. „Ausdauer und Geduld erringen des Glückes Huld". An unserer Ausdauer soll es nicht fehlen, darauf darf sich das deutsche Handwerk verlassen. (Bravo! rechts.) Präsident: Das Wort hat der Herr Abgeordnete vr. Baumbach. Abgeordneter Dr. Vaumbach: Meine Herren, die An­ nahme, daß irgend jemand auf dieser Seite des Hauses irgendwie in der Lage wäre, den Anträgen der Herren Kol­ legen Ackermann und Genossen zuzustimmen, halte ich für vollständig und absolut ausgeschlossen. Ich kann mich unter diesen Umständen sehr kurz fassen. Wir werden auch nicht in der Lage sein, für eine Kommission stimmen zu können; denn es versteht sich ja für uns von selbst, daß wir in der Kom­ mission ebenfalls nur ablehnend votieren könnten. Der Herr Kollege Ackermann beliebte im Eingang seiner Ausführungen von Verdächtigungen zu sprechen, welche er hier bei den früheren Beratungen seiner schönen Anträge ausge­ setzt gewesen sei. Ich muß sagen, von Verdächtigungen kann in diesem Fall schlechterdings nicht die Rede sein. Wir haben die Ackermannschen Anträge stets bekämpft, und wir werden sie auch künftig bekämpfen. Wir haben allerdings stets darauf hingewiesen, daß diese Anträge schließlich nur ein Endziel haben könnten, und daß das endliche Ideal des Herrn Ackermann und seiner Freunde kein anderes sein könne und sein werde, als die Zwangsinnungen. Es scheint, als ob auch heute von Ihrer Seite in Abrede gestellt werden sollte, dass Sie direkt auf die Zwangsinnungen lossteuern. Ich sage Ihnen: das, was Sie uns heute bringen, ist nichts anderes als die Zwangsinnungen, und ich muß sagen, dass ich in der That mit einer gewissen Genugtuung dies hier aussprechen. Denn wir haben, wie gesagt, wiederholt und nachdrücklich darauf hingewiesen, dass das, was Sie erstreben, nichts anderes sei, als die obligatorische Innung, als die Zwangsinnung. Mit welcher Emphase haben die Herren noch bei der letzten Beratung des Ackermannschen Lehrlingsparagraphen darauf hingewiesen, dass es sich dabei keineswegs handeln könne um einen Innungszwang, und dass von Zwangsinnungen schlechterdings nicht die Rede sein könne! Man sagte uns, dass das Ackermannsche Lehrlingsprivilegium ja nur dann gegeben werden sollte, wenn eine Innung aus dem Gebiet des Lehrlingswesens sich bewährt haben wird, dass nur dann die höhere Verwaltungsbehörde als besonderes Prämium eben dieser Innung das Lehrlingsprivilegium erteilen sollte. Wir dagegen haben immer die Auffassung unterhalten, dass es sich hierbei nur um einen Appell zu richten an den Egoismus der einzelnen Handwerksmeister, einen Appell an diesen Egoismus, insofern sie ihre Mitmeister von dem Halten von Lehrlingen, das heißt auf gut deutsch, von dem Ausnutzen dieser billigen Arbeitskräfte, ausschließen können. Das war und ist des Pudels Kern bei diesen Ackermannschen Anträgen: wer nicht freiwillig in die Innung hineingeht, der soll in die Innung hineingeärgert werden; das ist die letzte Tendenz des Herrn Kollegen Ackermann. Heute geht er nun noch einen Schritt weiter; heute ist nicht mehr davon die Rede oder wenigstens nicht in erster Linie davon die Rede, daß die Innung sich bewährt haben müsse, heute handelt es sich auch nicht mehr um das Ermessen der höheren Verwaltungsbehörde, sondern, wenn sich in einem Bezirke eine Innung gebildet hat, und wenn die Hälfte der Arbeiter in jedem Augenblicke, wenn ein neuer Zoll hier auftaucht, wissen sollte, ob irgend in einem Handelsvertrag dagegen eine Klausel vorhanden ist —, Sie haben es offenbar, warum wollen Sie es nicht geradeaus sagen, nicht gewußt! Sie haben den Zoll gestellt, wie viele andere, ohne Kenntnis der Tatsachen, aus einer gewissen — es ist ja gleichgültig, aus welcher Bestimmung heraus, und nun erfahren Sie, daß Sie eigentlich an das, worauf Sie es abgesehen haben, an das Geflügel aus Österreich, nicht heran können in Folge des Handelsvertrages. Ich möchte daher wirklich bitten, da dieser Zoll, wie er gemeint ist, absolut nicht in Kraft treten kann, uns doch wenigstens es zu ersparen, ihn in dieser Fassung anzunehmen. Lehnen Sie ihn auch in der dritten Lesung ab. Vizepräsident Freiherr von und zu Frauckenstein: Das Wort hat der Herr Abgeordnete Graf zu Stolberg-Wernigerode. Abgeordneter Graf zu Stolberg-Wernigerode: Der Herr Abgeordnete Richter hat vorhin bereits gesagt und jetzt eben wiederholt, wir hätten bei Stellung des Antrags nicht gewußt, daß dieser Zoll in Bezug auf Geflügel gebunden wäre durch den italienischen Handelsvertrag. Ja, da muss ich doch offen sagen, da traut uns doch der Abgeordnete Richter ein bisschen zu wenig zu. Ich begreife ja vollkommen, daß ein einzelner Abgeordneter, wenn er einen solchen Antrag liest, nicht im Augenblick im Stande ist, zu sagen, inwiefern dieser Antrag durch Handelsverträge beeinflußt wird; aber wenn eine große Anzahl Mitglieder zusammenkommt und derartige Anträge ausarbeiten und zwei- und dreimal berätten, dann werden Sie uns doch wahrhaftig zutrauen können, daß wir uns vorher die Handelsverträge ansehen. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gesagt, daß dieser Zoll gebunden wäre vorläufig durch Handelsverträge; allein, wie bereits ausgeführt ist, gibt es doch auch Länder, die nicht meistbegünstigt sind, und wir wissen sehr gut, daß aus Russland sehr viele Schneehühner eingehen. (Ah! links.) — Ja, meine Herren, wenn Sie es nicht wissen, thut es mir leid; wir haben es gewußt. Dann haben wir uns gesagt, daß, da wir jetzt im allgemeinen ein Schutzzollsystem haben und Handelsverträge geschlossen haben und zukünftig schließen wollen, es für uns sehr wesentlich ist, gerade in der Zeit, in welcher die Handelsverträge laufen, uns Kompensationsobjekte zu schaffen. (Sehr richtig! rechts.) Ich muss konstatieren, dass gerade dieses Moment ausdrücklich bei Beratung dieser Anträge innerhalb der einzelnen Vereinigungen zur Sprache gekommen ist, und ich glaube, aus dieser Tatsache allein geht bereits hervor, dass die Auffassung des Herrn Abgeordneten Richter, wir hätten von den Handelsverträgen nichts gewusst, eine absolut irrgerechte ist. Meine Herren, der Herr Abgeordnete Richter hat auch materiell gegen diesen Zoll eigentlich gar keine Gründe angeführt; er hat gesagt, er wäre kein Kompensationsobjekt für die Fleischzölle. Meine Herren, das sind ja alles negative Gründe; ein positiver Grund lässt sich nicht dagegen anführen, und ich glaube, wenn irgend ein Zoll gerechtfertigt ist, dann ist es dieser; er ist die natürliche Konsequenz der übrigen landwirtschaftlichen Zölle, und darum bitte ich Sie, ihn anzunehmen. (Bravo! rechts.) Vizepräsident Freiherr von und zu Franckenstein: Das Wort hat der Herr Abgeordnete Dirichlet. Abgeordneter Dirichlet: Meine Herren, ich kann ja natürlich nicht leugnen, dass der Herr Graf zu Stolberg-Wernigerode und vielleicht auch noch andere Herren sich den italienischen Handelsvertrag und die einzelnen Artikel desselben angesehen haben; selbstverständlich, wenn die Erklärung hier abgegeben wird, ist sie für uns verbindlich, und wir sind verpflichtet, daran zu glauben. Dann hätten aber die Herren wirklich, namentlich nach den Erklärungen des Herrn Grafen zu Stolberg-Wernigerode, welcher sagte, er begriff es vollständig und fände es sogar in Ordnung, dass, wenn man nicht Antragsteller wäre, man nicht in jedem Moment einen solchen Artikel gegenwärtig haben könnte, — dann hätte es die einfache parlamentarische Rücksicht auf die Debatten geboten, meine Herren, dass Sie uns von dieser Ihrer eingehenden Kenntnis Mitteilung gemacht hätten; wir sind doch eben nicht Antragsteller, Sie haben die Diskussion eröffnet, meine Herren! Und nun bitte ich Sie noch, wie verschieden behandeln Sie denn die Dinge? Vorher bei der Butterfrage, bei der Margarine-frage tritt ein Herr auf und hält es für notwendig, uns in einem beinahe einstündigen Vortrag zu belehren über das Wesen der Milchwirtschaft, das Wesen der Butterproduktion usw., uns über einzelne Dinge zu belehren, die wir so frei waren schon einfach als gewöhnliche Staatsbürger ziemlich genau zu kennen; während es sich aber hier darum handelt, über einen Artikel eines einzelnen Handelsvertrages orientiert zu sein — von dem der Herr Graf zu Stolberg selbst says, er könne das von einem Abgeordneten gar nicht verlangen—, hüllen Sie sich in ein höchst diplomatisches und gewiss sehr vornehmes Schweigen, das doch aber die Sachlichkeit unserer Debatten in keiner Weise befördert. — Ich erkläre also nochmals, dass ich selbstverständlich nach den Ausführungen des Herrn Grafen für meine Person daran glaube, dass die Herren das ausführlich erwogen haben; ob man aber im Publikum ein ebenso gläubiges Gemüt im allgemeinen haben wird, lasse ich nach dem Gange, den die Verhandlungen hier genommen haben, ganz dahingestellt. Der Herr Graf zu Stolberg hat dann ferner gesagt: Man hat ja nur Negatives gegen diesen Zoll angeführt, folglich ist es ein Zoll, der dringend notwendig ist. Ja, meine Herren, wie stimmt denn das zu der ganzen Theorie von der großen ehrlichen Probe des Zolltarifs und von den betreffenden Abänderungen, die nur da vorgenommen werden sollen, wo sich im Laufe der Praxis erhebliche Missstände herausgestellt haben? Meine Herren, die erheblichen Missstände in Bezug auf die russischen Schneehühner sind uns denn doch noch nicht in dem Grade klar geworden, als es auch vielleicht hier wieder als selbstverständlich vorausgesetzt worden ist. Es ist uns ferner sehr lehrreich gewesen, daß der Herr Graf zu Stolberg diese ganze Theorie, welche den Motiven des Zolles, zum Teil auch — wenigstens nach ihrer mündlichen Motivirung — den Beschlüssen der freien Vereinigung zu Grunde liegt, eigentlich über den Haufen geworfen hat. Er hat gar nicht gesagt: wir machen hier Zölle — oder er hat es vielmehr ausdrücklich gesagt: es kommt hier gar nicht darauf an, Zölle zu machen, Zölle zu verbessern, auf Grund der Erfahrungen zu revidieren, welche sich als unzweckmäßig herausgestellt haben, welche nach Lage der Dinge nicht ihren Zweck erfüllt haben, sondern wir wollen durch unsere Zolltarifnovelle in diesem Augenblick Kompensationsobjekte schaffen für die künftigen Zollverhandlungen mit unseren Nachbarn. Ja, meine Herren, dadurch ist die Sache auf ein ganz anderes Gebiet gestellt worden, dadurch gewinnt die Sache ein ganz anderes Ansehen; und da frage ich Sie, ob Sie in der Tat glauben, dass die Vorliebe des Herrn von Schalk dafür, dass die armen Ober schlesier, wenn sie keine fetten Gänse bezahlen können, lieber gar keinen Gänsebraten essen sollen, ein wichtiges und bedeutendes Kompensationsobjekt ist bei künftigen Verhandlungen mit Österreich-Ungarn über die Herstellung unseres Zolltarifs? Meine Herren, das ist ein Argument, was vielleicht noch mehr bei den Haaren herbeigezogen ist als irgend ein anderes. Reichstag. — 79. Sitzung. Freitag den 17. April 1885.

Die Vorrichtung besitzt Hiegel. welche bei Seilbruch in bekannter Weise durch Federn so achsial bewegt werden, daß ihre Enden seitlich aus dem Förderkorb heraustreten. Die Er- findung her-teht darin, daß sich die Riegel hei Seilbruch auf in Abständen im Schacht verteilte Gleitblöcke aufsetzen, welche «buch ein Seil miteinander verbunden sind. Das Seil ist über eine oben im Schacht gelagerte Rolle geführt und trägt an niiiem andern Ende eine Anzahl von Anschlägen, durch welche bei der infolge Seilbruchs durch die Riegel der Fangvorrichtung bewirkte Abwärtsbewegung der Gleitblöcke eine Anzahl von Gewichten nacheinander augehohen werden. Das fallende Förder- KStell kommt zum Stillstand, wenn seine lebendige Kraft durch die zum Anheben der Gewichte erforderliche Arbeit ver- braucht ist. 35a. 180369. vom 20. Juli 1906. Jakob Sonn in si. Ingbert. Pfalz. Signaleinrichtung zum Abgehen von Signalen vom Förderkorb uns. Die Einrichtung besteht aus zwei Teilen, nämlich einer Klemm Vorrichtung und dem Signalapparat. Die Klemmvor- richtung ist am Förderkorb angebracht und besitzt zwei feste Hollen b und eine in einer Führung c gelagerte Holle d. welche vermittels einer Zugstiinge f in der Führung bewegt werden kunn. Durch den Raum zwischen den drei Hollen läuft ein ■tdloses Seil g hindurch, welches an der Hängehank über eine Rolle h und an der Schachtsohle über eine Holle m geführt ist. Die Rolle «I wird durch Feilem von den Hollen b fort- gedrückt. so «laß das Seil bei der Bewegung des Förderkorbes so lange frei durch die Klemmvorrichtung hindurchläuft, bis es vom Forderkorb aus durch Bewegung der Holle d vermittels der Zugstange f zwischen die Hollen geklemmt und vom Förder- korb mitgenommen wird. Der auf der Hängebank befindliche Signalapparat besitzt für jeden Fönlerkorh eine (docke I, deren unter der Wirkung 'von Federn h stehender Klöppel in die Hahn von Ansätzen v hineinragt, welche auf den beiden Stirnflächen der Holle Ii vor- gesehen sind. Wenn auf einem Förderkorb die Klemmvor- richtungen geschlossen und daher das Seil g durch den Förder- korb mitgenommen wird, so wird abwechselnd durch die Ansätze der Scheibe h der Klöppel der zu dem Förderkorb gehörenden Glocke von dieser entfernt und durch die Federn Ii der Klöppel gegen die Glocke geschleudert, sobald einer der Ansätze ihn freigibt. Die (docke ertönt infolgedessen so lange, bis auf dem Förderkorb die Zugstange I freigegeben wird, so daß die Holle «I durch ihre Federn von den Hollen Ii entfernt, d.

Februar 1906. The Metals Extraction Corporation Limited in London. Ver- fahren zur Vorbereitung sulfidischer Mischerze für die Gewinnung der in ihnen enthaltenen Metalle durch Entfernung dex Zinkgehaltes der Erze. Nach dem Verfahren wird das Erz zunächst langsam hei dunkler Hotglut geröstet, zu dem Zwecke, das in dem Erz ent- haltene Zink in lösliche Sulfate überzuführen. Das geröstete Erz wird darauf vorteilhaft mit kochendem Wasser ausgelaugt, um das Zinksulfat zu lösen. Nachdem sich die Lösung gesetzt hat, wird sie in Behälter ablaufen gelassen, in welchem sie mit einer Lösung von Galciumchlorid versetzt wird. Hierbei wird Calciuinsulfat gebildet und niedergeschlagen, wobei gleichzeitig das gebildete Zinkchlorid in die Lösung geht. Letzteres wird von dem Niederschlag abgelassen und dient dazu, das in dem ausgelaugten Erz in Gestalt von Zinkoxyd verbliebene Zink auf- zulösen. Zu «lern Zweck wird das Erz in der Zinkchloridlösung bei deren Siedepunkt digeriert. Hierbei geht das in Lösung vorhandene Zinkchlorid in ein Oxychlorid über. Zu dieser Lösung wird entweder gelöschter Kalk. Kalkkarbonat. Magnesia oder Ätznatron in genügender Menge zugesetzt, um eine voll- k Biene Zersetzung des Zinkchlorids herbeizuführen. Der sieh bildende Zinkhvdrat- oder Zinkkarhonatniederschlag wird dann endgültig ausgelaugt, um von dem Chlorid befreit zu werden und wird darauf nach bekannten Verfahren auf die Herstellung von Handelszink bearbeitet. 40 a. 188020, vom 20.

Februar 1906. Louis Maurice Lafontaine in Paris. Elelrt roh/tisch es Ver- fahren zur Gewinnung der Metalle ans ihren Erzen, insbesondere zur Aufbereitung der Kupferabfälle zu reinem Kupfer. Das Verfahren besteht im wesentlichen darin, daß der mit reiner Schwefelsäure gemischten clektrolytischen Flüssigkeit Bariumsuperoxyd zugesetzt wird, welches sich darin unter Bildung von Wasserstoffsuperoxyd zersetzt. Der Zusatz von Bariumsuperoxyd in der Elektrolyse hat den Zweck, eine größere Menge Sauerstoff, als durch die saure Lösung allein geliefert wird, frei zu machen und im Augenblicke der Zer- setzung des Elektrolyt.es in Wasserstoff, Sauerstoff und Base (Säure) einen Überschuß an Sauerstoff zu bilden, welcher einer- seits sich nach der Anode begibt, um daselbst die .Metalle zu oxydieren, anderseits die den Metallnicdersehlag verhindernde Wasserstoff polarisation an der Kathode verhindert. 59a. 189138, vom 3.

Bei der Pumpe, die kein Saugventil besitzt, findet in bekann- ter Weise ein zeitweises Zurückführen von Flüssigkeit in den Flüssigkeitbehälter statt. Das Wesen der Erfindung besteht darin, daß neben dem eigentlichen Fördcrkolben ein vorteilhaft, auch als Kolben ausgebildeter Schieber vorhanden ist, der das Abschneiden der Flüssigkeit vom Flüssigkeitbehälter zu besorgen hat. Der Regulierkolben und der Fördcrkolben werden mit etwa DO" Vor- oder Nacheilung angetrieben, und die Regelung des Abschlusses erfolgt durch Verschiebung des Regulierkolbens in seiner Achsetirichtung. 59b. 189064, vom 22. Januar 1907. Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft in Berlin. Einrichtung zum, Druckausgleich an Kreiseln für Pumpen und Ven- tilatoren soirie Dampfturbinen riideru. In der Nahe der Kreisel bzw. der Rädel' oder in deren Welle sind Nuten angebracht, durch welche das sich auf der hintern Seite der Kreisel bzw. Räder sammelnde Förderinodium auf die Vorderseite der Kreisel bzw. Räder fließt, Da diese Nuten nur eine geringe Umfangsgeschwindigkeit haben, kann das Förder- inedium verhältnismäßig leicht durch sie hindurehfließeu. ohne woggepeitscht zu werden. Außerdem schwächen die Nuten die Kreisel- bzw. Radscheiben fast gar nicht. Üm das Durchströmen des Förderinedi ums von der hintern zur vordem Seite des Krei- sels bzw. Bades zu erleichtern, kann einerseits die Nut .schrauben- förmig ausgebildet sein, wobei ihr Drehsinn dem Drehsinn der AVelle entgegengesetzt ist, anderseits kann die radiale Nuthöhe am Eintritt geringer gewählt werden als am Austritt, sodaß die Eintrittstelle dem Einfließen des .Mediums in die Nut geringen Widerstand entgegensetzt und die Austrittstelle schleudernd, also saugend, auf das Mediuni wirkt.

Üral für den Rückgang von Förderrinnen, die durch un- runde Scheiben oder Daumen in Schwingbewegung gesetzt werden, eine größere Zeit zur Verfügung zu haben als für den Hingang, was für die Förderleistung der Rinnen von großer Bedeutung ist. ist gemäß der Erfindung die zum Antrieb der Binnen dienende unrunde Scheibe bzw. der Daumen a so aus- gebildet, daß der Winkel zwischen dem Anfangleitstrnhl o l> und dem Maximalleitstrahl o— d kleiner als ISO " ist. Die un- rnnde Scheibe wirkt in üblicher Weise auf die Holle f eines einarmigen um einen festen Punkt drehbaren Hebels, dessen freies Ende gelenkig mit der Förderrinne g verbunden ist. laue Feiler h, welche mit einem Ende an der Förderrinne befestigt ist, bewirkt ein Anliegen der Rolle f an der unrunden Scheibe a. 81 e. 189 299, vom 15.

Die Vorrichtung besitzt in bekannter Weise einerseits am Gehänge a des Transportgefäßes einen drehbaren Hebel b mit starrem Feststellhaken b '. der an der Stelle, an der das Gefäß gekippt werden soll, durch eine Schiene g angehoben wird, an- derseits an der Stirnwand des Transportgefäßes einen Knaggen d mit schräger Gleitfläche, hinter den der Haken fällt und das Gefäß feststellt. Gemäß der Erfindung ist am Hebel b ein Arm b1 angebracht, der einerseits bei Auslösung des Hakens b*2 an den Knaggen d des Gefäßes anstößt und dadurch dies Kippbewegung des Gefäßes einleitet, anderseits beim Zurückschwingen des u äßes von den den Haken anhebenden schrägen Knaggen derart angestoßen wird, daß der Haken mit Sicherheit wieder hinter den Knaggen fällt.

Für die Bewegung kommen die Gesetze der kommunizierenden Röhren und die der Reibungswider- stände in Betracht. Die Bodensenkung durch Wasser- entziehung und Abtrocknuug könnte erst dann erfolgen, wenn die Druckwirkung der überlagernden Schichten im- stande wäri', die Quarzkörner zu zermalmen. Das würde bei der Austrocknung von ca. 17 000 m mächtigen Schich- ten der Fall sein. Bodensenkungen durch Einsturz ent- wässerter Rinnsale und ähnlicher Hohlräume im Sande glaubt der Verfasser ebenso wie durch Veränderung des Grundwasserspiegels in seiner Form und Höhenlage nicht annehmen zu dürfen. Anders dagegen verhält sich der Boden beim Ableiten artesischer Brunnen, wo durch Mit- reißen von Sandpartikeln Hohlräume entstehen  prospeetors - IV. Von Alderson. (Forts.) Min. Wld. 24. Aug.

()m tillgodogörande of Norrbottens järnmalmer in om landet. Von Brin eil. Jernk. Annal. Heft 4/5. Abhandlung über die Frage der Ausbeutung der Eisenerze in Norrbotten in schwedischen Hütten. Verfasser kommt zu dem Schlüsse, daß 1. die gegenwärtig betriebenen Eisenwerke Schwedens der hohen Frachtkosten wegen die phosphorhaltigen Erze von Norrbotten in größerm Umfailgc nicht werden verarbeiten können: 2. an der Küste neu zu errichtende Eisenhütten zwar die Erze ver- arbeiten können, aber den größten Teil ihrer Erzeugnisse exportieren müßten und hierbei mit dem Ausland hin- sichtlich der Preise nicht konkurrieren könnten; 3. die Leistungsfähigkeit, solange die Eisenindustrie auf importierte Brennstoffe angewiesen ist. nicht derart gesteigert werden kann, daß die heute exportierten Erze ganz oder zum größten Teil im Lande selbst verarbeitet werden; 4. die Methoden der Eisenerzeugung auf elektrischem Wege noch zu wenig durchgebildet sind und, selbst wenn sie es wäre::, immerhin nur etwa die Hälfte des Kohlenbedarfs ersparen ließen; 5. die Verwendung von Torf in der Eisen- industrie solange nicht in Frage kommen kann, als man zur Entfernung des natürlichen Wassergehaltes auf die Lufttrocknung angewiesen ist, und (i. sonstige erprobte Herstelluhgsmethodei), welche die Veredlung größerer Mengen Norrbotten-Erze im Lande gestatteten, zur Zeit nicht bekannt sind, aber 7. sehr wohl die vorhandenen Wasserkräfte und Torfmoore in Zukunft eine bessere Entwicklung der schwedischen Eisenindustrie ermöglichen dürften.

Zuschriften an die Redaktion.1 Die Entgegnung des Herrn Erlinghagen in Nr. 33 ent- hält die unrichtige Angabe, daß ich die zu seiner Ver- öffentlichung benutzte Photographie in einem öffentlichen Vortrage an Herrn Dr. ing. Preise in Aachen vorbehaltlos übergeben hätte. Vielmehr habe ich diese Photographie mit Brief unter dem 15. Oktober 1905 unter dem aus- drücklichen Vorbehalt, davon keinen Gebrauch zu machen, an Herrn Dr. ing. Preise gelangen lassen. Mit Brief vom 20. Oktober hat mir Herr Dr. ing. Preise bestätigt, daß er von einer Beschreibung und Kritik usw. absehen werde. Guido Körner, Dipl. Bergingenieur. Nordhausen am Harz. Ich habe in meiner Entgegnung in Nr. 33 nicht be- hauptet, daß Herr Körner die Photographie Herrn Dr. Preise ohne Vorbehalt in dem betreffenden Vortrag übergeben habe, sondern nur, daß Herr Körner in einem Vortrage 10 — 12 derartige Photographien ohne Vorbehalt verteilt hat. Herr Körner sucht also etwas -zu wider- legen, was ich gar nicht gesagt habe. Im übrigen ist die Zuschrift in Nr. 33, soweit sie Herrn Dr. Freise an- geht, mit dessen ausdrücklicher Zustimmung veröffentlicht worden; ich habe auch jetzt keine Veranlassung, irgend welche Zweifel in die Zuverlässigkeit der Angaben von Herrn Dr. Freise zu setzen. Dr. Erlinghagen. Nordhausen. Die Ausführungen des Herrn Körner sind objektiv unrichtig, da sich meine Kritik nur auf den im Hoch- schulvortrage zu Aachen von Herrn Körner behandelten Apparat bezieht; die dabei vorbehaltlos verteilte Photographie steht in keinem Zusammenhang mit der mir übersandten Zeichnung vom 20.

I v e r Die elektrische Fördermaschine besitzt gegenüber derDampffönlermasehine den Vorzug, die Geschwindig- keit genau regeln zu können: das hat dazu geführt, daß die Bergbehörde, die die Höchstgeschwindigkeit bei der Seilfahrt für die Dampffördermaschine auf 6 — 8 m, festgesetzt hat, sie bei elektrischen Förder- maschinen hauptsächlich infolge der geringem Unfallgefahr auf 10 m erhöht hat. Die Konstrukteure der Dampffördermaschine sind zur Zeit bemüht, diesen Vorsprung wieder einzuholen, nachdem durch Ver- besserungen in der Steuerung usw. die Wirtschaftlich- keit der Damffördermaschine auf einen der elektrischen Fördermaschine mindestens ebenbürtigen Stand ge- hoben ist. Die Unfallgefahr bei der Fördermaschine liegt ent- weder im Stauchen (zu hartem Aufsetzen des untern Korbes) oder im übertreiben (des obern Korbes). Nach der Unfallstatistik mehrerer Oberbergämter entfallen ungefähr zwei Drittel aller bei der Seilfahrt vor- kommenden Unfälle auf das Stauchen, während nur ein verhältnismäßig geringer Teil durch Übertreiben verursacht wird. Um eine bessere Übersicht über die Ursachen der Gefahren zu geben, die bei einer Fördermaschinenan- lage vorhanden sind, sind in Fig. 1 die Belastungs- verhältnisse einer Fördermaschine wiedergegeben, bei der eine mittlere Gefahr des Stauchens und Über- XLIII 40 en für Dampffördermaschinen. ■ s e n , Berlin. treibens vorhanden ist. Als Beispiel ist eine ohne Seilausgleich arbeitende Zwillingsfördermaschine mit zylindrischen Trommeln gewählt worden, die aus einer Teufe von 400 m eine Nutzbist von 2500 kg, oder bei der Seilfahrt 1800 kg, (24 Mann zu je 75 kg) fördert. Das unausgeglichene Seilgewicht beträgt 400 X 7,5 = 3000 kg. Die auf den Trommelumfang reduzierte Gesamt- masse berechnet sich bei der Produktenförderung zu 3800, bei der zweitrümmigen Seilfahrt zu 3650 und bei der eintrünunigen Seilfahrt zu 3500 Massenein- heiten. Die Bremskraft beträgt r. 18 000 kg, be- zogen auf den Trommeldurchmesser. Bei der Produktenförderung . ergibt sich nach dem Diagramm I zuBeginn des Förderzuges eine Belastung von: 2500 + 3000 = + 5500 kg und am Ende eine solche von : 2500 — 3000 = — 500 kg. Hierbei ist aber die Reibung noch nicht berück- sichtigt, die im Durchschnitt mit 900 kg" angesetzt werden kann. Dann stellt sich die Last zu Beginn des Förderzuges auf -)- 6400 kg und am Ende auf -\- 400 kg, also während des ganzen Förderzuges positiv. Unter diesen Verhältnissen läßt sich die Maschine ohne Schwierigkeit regeln entweder durch Veränderung der Füllung oder - bei kleinern Ge- schwindigkeiten — durch Drosselung, wobei meistens mit großen Füllungen gearbeitet werden muß. Auf 1 1322 G 1 ü c kauf Nr. 40 diese Weise kann eine vorzügliche Regelung erzielt werden, denn das Tangentialdruckdiagramm bei positiver Leistung entspricht einem Bande von an- nähernd gleichbleibender Höhe, (Fig. 2) die von der Füllung oder dein Anfangdruck abhängig ist und so- / Produkten Forderung 7*= Teu fe- ilZweitrümmige Seilfahrt W Eintrümmige Seilfahrt K= Nutzlast R 'Reibung q~T' Seilgeiv/chT Q,a=ZugkraftamJnfa/ig\ ße - • • Ende f desForderzuge^ Fig. 1.

Bei der »Seilfahrt sind zweitrümmige und ein- trümmige Seilfahrt zu unterscheiden. Diagramm II zeigt die Belastungsverhältnisse bei doppeltrümmiger Seilfahrt. Hierbei gleicht sich die Belastung durch die Belegschaft der beiden Körbe aus. und als Belastung an der Trommel wirkt lediglich das Seilgewicht ver- Nu Ilm ie 9 18 27 36 ¥S 51 63 72 61 90° Kurbeltfinkel Fig, mehrt 2. Tangentialdruckdiagramro bei positiver Leistung. oder vermindert um den Betrag der Reibung. Danach stellt sich die Last zu Beginn des Förderzuges auf: + 3000 + 900 = -f 3900 kg. und zu Ende auf: 3000 -f- 900 - 2100 kg, sie geht also all- mählich von positiver in negative Belastung über. Noch schlechter stellen sich die Verhältnisse bei eintrümmiger Seilfahrt, und zwar wenn bei Einfahrt der Belegschaft nicht gleichzeitig Ausfahrt stattfindet; Hierbei wird die durch das Seilgewicht im zweiten Teil des Förderzuges hervorgerufene negative Belastung noch um das Gewicht der einfahrenden Mannschaft vermehrt; die Belastungsverhältnisse sind nach Dia- gramm III zu Beginn des Förderzuges: -f 3000 + 900 — 1800 = + 2100 kg, und zu Ende des Zuges: - 3000 + 900 — 1800 = 3900 kg. Hier ist also während des größten Teils des Förder- zuges negative Belastung vorhanden, die auszugleichen ist. Als Mittel hierfür kommt bei einer Regelung durch die Dampfmaschine selbst nur das Gegendampf- geben in Betracht . Zu diesem Zwecke wird die Steuerung umgelegt, und die Maschine arbeitel als Kompressor auf den Raum zwischen Zylinder und Drosselklappe oder Einströmventil. Mit jeder Umdrehung steigt der mittlere Kompressionsdruck. da aus der Auspüffleitung mit jedem Hub neue Luit angesaugt wird, Hierbei zeigt die Kompressionslinie der Zwillingsmaschine einen kennzeichnenden Spannungsabfall in dem Augenblick, wo die Kurbel des zweiten Zylinders den Totpunkt überschreitet. In Fig. 3 sind drei aufeinanderfolgende Gegendampf- diagrämme wiedergegeben, die an einer Zwillingsförder- rnaschine genommen sind (der Steuerhebel war dabei Atm. Fig. 3. I regendampfdiagramm. in einer bestimmten Lage festgelegt), und in Fig. 4 sind die hiernach ohne Berücksichtigung der Massen- kräfte berechneten Tangentialdruckdiagramme einzeln aufgetragen und unten einander gegenübergestellt Die Figuren zeigen deutlich, welche Ungleichmäßigkeiten hierbei in den Drehmomenten auftreten, indem z. B. Diagramm B die größte Tangentialkraft in derjeni- gen Kurbelstellung (r. 75°) aufweist, in der bei dem nächstfolgenden Diagramm C die kleinste Drehkraft liegt, Außerdem wachsen die Drehmomente von Um- drehung zu Umdrehung an. Das Gegendampfgeben hat also einen doppelten Nachteil; die Gegenkraft ändert sich während ein und derselben Umdrehung in unberechenbarer Weise, sodann kann sie nicht nach einem bestimmten, von den Belastungs Verhältnissen abhängigen Gesetz eingestellt und verändert werden, wie es bei positiver Maschinenleistung in genauester und einfachster Weise möglich ist. Es ist. demnach ein wenig zuverlässiges Mittel, zwecks Regelung der Geschwindigkeit die lebendige Kraft der Maschine aufzuzehren. Dabei ist außerdem die Handhabung der Steuerung sehr schwierig, denn der Maschinist muß genau achtgeben, daß der Gegendruck das zulässige Maß nicht überschreitet, damit die Maschine nicht zu früh zum Stillstand kommt. Beim Gegendampfgeben muß der Führer aber um den Gegendruck zu mindern, den Steuerhebel wieder- holt in die Treibdampfstellung zurücklegen. Dadurch entsteht die Gefahr, dal) der hierbei sinkende Druck unter das Maß zurückgeht, das notwendig ist, um der ne- gativen Belastung die Wage zu halten. Die Folge ist eine durch die negative Belastung herbeigeführte Beschleu- nigung der Maschine, die um so größer wird, weil der 5. Oktober 1907 G 1 ü c kauf 1323 vorher komprimierte Dampf zwischen Zylinder und Ein- laßventil (oderDrosselklappe) beimUmlegen der Steuerung auf der entgegengesetzten Kolbenseite treibend wirkt. O 9 18 27 36 tS 5* 63 72 81 90° Kurbelwinkel Fig. 4. Tangentialdruckdiagramm. Welche Anforderungen hierbei an die Geschick- lichkeit des Maschinisten gestellt werden, und wie kurz die Zeit ist, die ihm für die verschiedenen Be- wegungen des Steuerhebels zur Verfügung steht, zeigt die rechnerische Betrachtung der Verhältnisse am Ende des Förderzuges. Nimmt man an, daß bei eintrümmiger .Seilfahrt (Diagramm III) der untere Förderkorb in einer Höhe von s — (j m über der Aufsatz-Vorrichtung noch eine Geschwindigkeit von \\ = 2,5 m/sek besitzt, und daß die Maschine infolge einer Unachtsamkeit des Maschi- nisten von da an kein Drehmoment, weder positiv noch negativ, mehr ausübt, sondern lediglich unter dem Einfluß der überhängenden Belastung steht, so wirkt diese an dem niedergehenden Seil mit einer Kindestkraft von 3900 -2X0X7.5 = r. 3800 kg. Die Massen der Maschine erhalten hierdurch eine Beschleunigung von: 3SOO 3500 ' /sek. m 'st Nach dem Durchfahren der noch bleibenden 6 m kommt dann der Korb mit einer Geschwindigkeit von \% = V 2fs + v* 2X 1 ,lX6+2;58 = r. 4,41 m/sek 1,74 Sek. am Füllorte an, und die zum DurchJahren der Strecke erforderliche Zeil berechne! sieb zu: 2s 2X6 Vl + v2 2,5+4,41 Ist die Geschwindigkeit an »lein angenommenen Punkte (G m über dem Füllorte) p.OCh größer als 2,5 m, so vergrößert sich natürlich die Endge- schwindigkeit, und die zum Durchfahren der kurzen Streckt4 notwendige Zeil wird entsprechend kürzer. Die Rechnung zeigt also, wie hohe Anforderungen an die Aufmerksamkeit des Maschinisten gestellt werden, da eine kaum zwei Sekunden dauernde Unachtsam- keit einen schweren Unfall herbeiführen kann. Das Ergebnis wird in noch ungünstigorm Sinne beeinflußt, wenn etwa infolge zu langsamer Bewegung der Steuerung an dein Troinmelumfang ein positives Drehmoment erzeugt wird. In diesem Falle findet nicht nur ein heftiges Stauchen des untern Korbes statt, sondern der obere Korb wird nieist auch über die Hängebank bis gegen den Prellbalken (Kopfrenner) gezogen. Diese Rechnungen erklären die Ursache der durch die Bergbehörde festgestellten Tatsachen, daß ungefähr 2/3 aller bei der Seilfahrt vorkommenden Unfälle durch das Stauchen herbeigeführt werden. Eine weitere Ursache für Unglücksfälle liegt in der falschen Handhabung der Steuerung beim Anfahren, wodurch ein Übertreiben herbeigeführt werden kann. Bei ungünstiger Kurbelstellung kann die dem obigen Beispiel zugrunde liegende Maschine am Trommel- umfange eine mittlere Kraft von 7200 kg ausüben. Nimmt man an, daß der untere Korb aufsitzt, und der obere Korb mit 24 Leuten = = 1800 kg belastet ist, und rechnet man ferner das Gewicht des beladenen Korbes und die Reibung ab, so bleiben von dieser Unifangskraft 'noch etwa 3900 kg übrig, die eine Be- schleunigung der Massen bewirken können. Sie be- rechnet sich zu: f= R : m = 3900: 3150 - r. 1,24 und der Weg von der Hängebank bis zu dem Prell- balken von r. 5 m wird von dem Korb in zurückgelegt. Die Verhältnisse werden jedoch gefährlich, wenn der untere Förderkorb nicht aufsitzt, sondern falls zur Verhütung des Stauchens, die untern Kaps zurück- gezogen sind, und der nunmehr frei an dem nieder- gehenden Seil hängende Korb in den Sumpf hinab- gehen kann. Dann ergibt sich eine Umfangskraft von 7200 + 3000 — 900 = 9300 kg, die eine Beschleuni- gung von: f = 9300 : 3650 = r. 2,55 m/sek hervorruft. Der Weg bis zum Prellbalken wird dann in t , f 2X5 \ 2,55 1.98 sek zurückgelegt.

a) 


Streichung diskriminierender technischer, wirtschaftlicher oder finanzieller Spezifikationen aus der Aufforderung zur Angebotsabgabe, den Auftragsunterlagen oder sonstigen das Ausschreibungsverfahren betreffenden Dokumenten und Durchführung neuer Vergabeverfahren,

eine nach Absatz 1 Buchstabe b vorgeschlagene ausgleichende Anpassung ausreicht, um die einvernehmlich vereinbarten Marktzugangsverpflichtungen auf einem vergleichbaren Niveau zu halten, oder




b) 


die Änderung eine Beschaffungsstelle betrifft, die gemäß Absatz 2 faktisch nicht mehr der Kontrolle oder dem Einfluss der Vertragspartei unterliegt.
Die jeweils andere Vertragspartei erhebt innerhalb von 45 Tagen nach Erhalt der in Absatz 1 Buchstabe a genannten Mitteilung schriftlich Einspruch; andernfalls wird davon ausgegangen, dass sie die ausgleichende Anpassung oder die Änderung angenommen hat, auch für die Zwecke von Teil Sechs Titel I.

Erhebt eine Vertragspartei Einwände, so legt sie die Gründe dar, aus denen sie der Auffassung ist, dass die vorgeschlagene Berichtigung keine Änderung im Sinne von Absatz 1 darstellt, und beschreibt die Auswirkungen der vorgeschlagenen Berichtigung auf die einvernehmlich vereinbarten Marktzugangsverpflichtungen nach diesem Titel. Werden innerhalb von 45 Tagen nach Erhalt der Mitteilung keine schriftlichen Einwände erhoben, so wird dies als Zustimmung der betreffenden Vertragspartei zu der beabsichtigten Berichtigung gewertet.

Article: Karl Gottlieb Pfander (* 3. November 1803 in Waiblingen, Württemberg; † 1. Dezember 1865 in Richmond, London) war ein deutscher protestantischer Missionar, der zunächst im Auftrag der Basler Mission, anschließend für die Church Mission Society arbeitete. Er sah sein Lebensziel darin, Muslime zum Christentum zu bekehren.

Leben 
Karl Gottlieb Pfander wurde als eines von neun Kindern eines Bäckermeisters in Waiblingen geboren, wo pietistische Einflüsse beispielsweise von Johann Albrecht Bengel und Friedrich Christoph Oetinger das Alltagsleben prägten. Er besuchte zunächst eine Lateinschule und erhielt ab 1819 eine Ausbildung in der neu errichteten Brüdergemeinde Korntal. Von 1821 bis 1825 ließ er sich an der Evangelischen Missionsgesellschaft in Basel zum Missionar ausbilden und lernte in dieser Zeit Persisch, Türkisch und Arabisch.

Nach seiner Ordination 1825 wurde er nach Schuscha im transkaukasischen Bergkarabach entsandt, wo er sich bis 1829 der Missionierung der islamischen Minderheit zuwandte, während andere Mitarbeiter der Basler Mission ihren Schwerpunkt auf die Reform der Armenisch-Apostolischen Kirche legten. Nach einer zweijährigen Zusammenarbeit mit Anthony Norris Groves in Bagdad und einem kurzen Aufenthalt in Konstantinopel wurde er von der CMS nach Britisch-Indien geschickt, wo er 1841 seine Missionstätigkeit in Agra aufnahm. Hier erwarb er sich Bekanntheit durch einen öffentlichen Disput mit dem sunnitischen Gelehrten Rahmatallāh al-Kairānawī im April 1854. Der britische Kolonialbeamte und Islamwissenschaftler William Muir beschrieb das Streitgespräch zwischen Pfander und Kairanawi, bei dem unter anderem die Bedeutung des Barnabasevangeliums zur Sprache kam, unter dem Titel The Mohammedan Controversy im Jahre 1897. Nach einem dreijährigen Einsatz ab 1855 in Peschawar wurde er 1858 von der CMS nach Konstantinopel entsandt, wo er infolge seiner missionarischen Tätigkeit, zusammen mit weiteren Missionaren, verhaftet und gefangen genommen wurde. Nachdem Großbritannien die Entlassung der Gefangenen erwirkt hatte, verbot das Osmanische Reich die Fortführung der missionarischen Tätigkeit. Pfander zog sich nach England zurück und ließ sich in Richmond bei London nieder, wo er 1865 starb.

Als sein Hauptwerk gilt die apologetische Schrift Mizan al-Haqq, die er aus dem deutschen Original unter dem Titel „Waage der Wahrheit“ übersetzt hatte und im Rahmen seiner Tätigkeit in weitere Sprachen übertrug. Spätere Ausgaben des Mizan referenzierte er mit Auszügen aus Gustav Weils biographischen Arbeiten über Mohammed.

Pfander war zweimal verheiratet. Seine erste Frau, Sophia Reuss aus Deutschland, heiratete er im Juli 1834 in Moskau, sie starb zehn Monate später in Schuscha im Kindbett. Mit seiner zweiten Frau, der Engländerin Emily Swinburne, die er 1841 in Kalkutta heiratete, hatte er drei Söhne und drei Töchter.

Die Bahnstrecke Kühnhausen–Bad Langensalza ist eine eingleisige Nebenbahn im mittleren Thüringen. Sie verbindet die Landeshauptstadt Erfurt mit der Kurstadt Bad Langensalza. Sie trägt auch den Spitznamen Hängebittel.

Geschichte 
Die Bahnstrecke Kühnhausen–Bad Langensalza wurde am 25. November 1897 in Betrieb genommen. Zwischen Döllstädt und Gräfentonna war die Bahnstrecke von Erfurt nach Bad Langensalza mit der seit 1889 bestehenden Bahnstrecke von Ballstädt nach Straußfurt gebündelt.

Ab dem 24. Mai 1998 wurde die Bahnstrecke von der Erfurter Bahn (EB 1) befahren. Hierbei kamen Fahrzeuge des Typs Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 zum Einsatz. Die Züge verkehrten von 5 bis 22 Uhr, zwischen 10 und 18 Uhr im angenäherten Stundentakt mit Kreuzung in Kühnhausen und in der Nebenverkehrszeit im 2-Stunden-Takt von Erfurt nach Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe bzw. Mühlhausen und benötigten für eine Fahrt Erfurt Hbf–Bad Langensalza 43 bis 52 Minuten.

Seit dem Fahrplanwechsel am 15. Dezember 2013 verkehrt auf der Strecke die DB Regio Südost. Diese setzt hier unter dem Namen Nordthüringenbahn im Wechsel Regionalbahn- und Regionalexpresszüge (Baureihen 641 und 642) ein.
Letztere halten nur noch an wenigen Unterwegsbahnhöfen, verkürzen aber dadurch die Fahrzeit zwischen Erfurt und Bad Langensalza auf unter 40 Minuten.

Article: Die Helferich-Synthese, -Methode oder -Glycosidierung, auch Helferich und Schmitz-Hillebrecht-Synthese, ist eine Namensreaktion in der Organischen Chemie. Beschrieben wurde sie erstmals 1933 von dem deutschen Chemiker Burckhardt Helferich (1887–1982) und dem Chemiker Ernst Schmitz-Hillebrecht. Sie dient der direkten Synthese von Phenylglykosid aus Monosaccharid-Pentaacetat und Phenol unter saurer Katalyse.

Übersichtsreaktion 
Bei dieser Reaktion reagiert ein fünffach acetylierter Kohlenhydrat-Ring mit Phenol im sauren Milieu zu acetyliertem Phenylglykosid. In Anwesenheit von ZnCl2 entsteht das α-Glykosid mit dem Phenoxy-Rest in axialer Position. Bei Zugabe von p-Toluolsulfonsäure (TsOH) bildet sich jedoch das β-Glykosid mit dem Phenoxy-Rest in äquatorialer Position.

Reaktionsmechanismus

Katalysator Zinkchlorid – α-Glykosid-Bildung 
Im vorgeschlagenen Reaktionsmechanismus entsteht ein α-Phenylglykosid 3:

Es wird angenommen, dass das Sauerstoffatom im Kohlenhydratring und das der Carbonylgruppe von 1 zunächst mit dem ZnCl2 wechselwirkt. Zu 2 wird anschließend das Phenol hinzugegeben. In einem Übergangszustand greift das Phenol von der Unterseite an und es kommt zur Bildung des α-Phenylglykosids 3.

Katalysator p-Toluolsulfonsäure – β-Glykosid-Bildung 
Das β-Phenylglykosid 3 entsteht – nach Zerong Wang – entlang der folgenden Reaktionskette:

Bei der Einwirkung von TsOH auf 1 wird zunächst Essigsäure (AcOH) abgespalten, so entsteht das Oxoniumion 2. Bei Zugabe von Phenol abstrahiert das Tosylat-Anion zunächst ein Proton unter Bildung eines Phenoxy-Anions, das sogleich 2 angreift, wobei  sich diastereoselektiv das β-Glykosid  3 bildet.

In einem dortigen Hause wohnte vom August 1870 bis 1. März 1871 die Frau v. Sch. , welche ihre Wohnung zu dem genannten Zeitpunkt ge kündigt hatte. Im Laufe des Monats Februar kam nun die verheirathete Tochter des Hauswirthes in Be gleitung vorschiedener Miethslustigen in jene Wohnung um dieselbe von diesen besichtigen zu lassen. Frau v. Sch. war während der Zeit bettlägerig krank und ver bat sich die Besuche , worauf zu rücksichtigen die Tochter des Wirthes sich nicht für verpflichtet hielt. Frau v. Sch. wendete sich hierauf an die Polizeibehörde , auf deren Vermittlung hin Frau v. Sch. die Erlaubniß ertheilte , daß die Wohnung in den Nachmittagsstunden von 3 bis 4 Uhr zu dem genannten Zwecke in Augen schein genommen werden könne. Die Tochter des Wirthes hielt sich aber als von ihrem Vater beauf tragt dennoch für berechtigt die Besichtigung der Woh nung zu jeder Tageszeit vorzunehmen , und führte die selbe trotz wiederholter Aufforderung der Frau v. Sch. sofort ihre Wohnung zu verlassen aus. Hierauf erhob Frau 5. Sch. Anklage wegen Hausfriedensbruches , und das Ergebniß der gestrigen Verhandlung war , daß die Tochter des Wirthes zu sechs Wochen Gesäng niß verurtheilt wurde. — Das Berliner Intellsgenzblott enthält folgendes Inserat : „ Für Wohnungslose.

Der perling hat ihu todtgebissen und ist damit weggeflogen. * Ich werde aus Ziegelsteinen eine Falle machen und # n boshaften Vielfraß darin fangen. Ich werde ihn in enen Käfig schließen , den Mörder ; dann wird er seine Aber , Kind , sagte die Frau , was kann der unschuldige Sperling dafür ? Er frißt um zu leben. 1 So , Mutter , du findest es gerecht , daß dieser Sper nz , weil er stark ist , solch einen armen Schmetterling Stücke beißt ? Wenn ich den Neidhammel fangen kann , bll er wissen , warum ! Es ist ein böses Thier ; ich kenne hu wohl ; er wohnt dort oben , unter unserm Dach und hat im Maimonat noch zwei Maikäfer von mir auf efressen. Ach , das unglückliche Schmetterlingchen ! So eben spielte es noch so fröhlich. und nun ist es ston 6 Komm , Kind , ebeeile dich nur ; denn es ist schon.

Von en Schmetterlingen kommen die Raupen , Kind , und wenn ie Vögel nicht viele Schmetterlinge verschlängen , wür den die Raupen Alles abnagen und verderben , und dann bürden auch die Menschen vor Hunger vergehen. Das Mädchen , durch diese Beweisführung nicht über eugt , setzte ihre Arbeit fort , indem sie in sich hinein über den grausamen Vogel murrte. * Nachdem Beide eine lange Weile still geschwiegen hat en , kam ein großer Hund durch die Oeffnung der Hecke un das Gärtchen. Das Thier sprang an dem Stuhle der Frau empor , um von ihr eine Liebkosung zu erhalten , kind lief dann mit dem Schweife wedelnd zu Annchen , die ihm fröhlich die Arme um den Hals schlang und sachend mit ihm auf das Gras rollte. Annchen , du übermüthiges Kind , schalt die Mutter strenge. Willst du wohl gleich aufstehen ? Du machst deine Kleider schmutzig. Türk , du guter Türk , sagte das Mädchen , sich auf richtend. Verhalte dich nur still ; sogleich , wenn die Kar toffeln auf dem Feuer stehen , werden wir spielen. Mut ter , Türk sagt , daß Käthchen kommt. Es ist Zeit , Kind ; sie muß dir in der Küche helfen. Horch , dort hinten ist sie. Sie singt wieder das aartige Liedchen von den Bauern , Mutter. Ich kann es kauch schon auswendig. Und das Kind , seine Stimme mit den noch entfern en Tönen vereinigend , begann zu hüpfen und sang : Wir Bauern und Bäuerinnen , Wir schaffen Tag und Nacht ; Wir pflügen und wir spinnen , Und singen aus aller Macht : Gib Brod und Kleidung , lieber Herr , Das Himmelreich und dann nichts mehr !

Diesen Morgen dacht ' ich ; es würde donnern , aber die Wolken sind verschwunden , und nun weht ein leises , kühles Lüft chen , das einem Hals und Wangen streichelt wie mit Flaumfederchen. Es hat fast vier Tage hintereinander geregnet und nun kommt die warme Sonne darauf. Alles Grün in unserm Garten steht so üppig , daß man meinen sollte , das Gras wachsen zu sehen. Ja , Käthe , antwortete die Mutter , es ist ein himmli sches Wetter und ich fühle mich , so zu sagen , aufleben , vorzüglich wenn du her kommst ; denn , liebes Kind , du bist die Fröhlichkeit selbst und die Sonne scheint immer in deinem Herzen. 6 8 Käthe Verhooven hatte ein Taschenmesser hervorgeholt und war schon mit dem Schälen der Kartoffeln beschäf tigt ; sie mußte es viel in ihrem Leben gethan haben , denn die Schalen flogen nur so durch ihre Finger , als spänne sie Fäden an einem Spinnrade. Warum doch sollte ich mir Kummer machen , Mutter ? antwortete sie auf die Bemerkung der alten Frau. Der Mensch hat nicht mehr Glück , als er sich selber gibt. Sich ärgern und murren hilft doch zu nichts. Wollte ich traurig sein , ich würde wohl leicht Ursache dazu fin den. Mein Vater sieht diesen Morgen so sauer gegen mich , als ob er sehr böse wäre ; aber es ist seine Schuld nicht , er muß immer brummen. Dies ist nun sein Ver gnügen , und er ist so geboren. Der einzige Kummer , den ich noch gehabt habe , war Eure schlimme Krankheit , Mutter. Nun ihr gesund seid. Gesund , Kind ? das ist etwas viel gesagt. Die Beine , meint Ihr. Ach , die werden auch all mählich wieder hergestellt werden. Allmählich , Käthe ? Wer weiß ? Es wird gleichwohl lange , lange dauern. Gott ist gütig , und Hoffen ist eine Pflicht und ein Glück. Da sind die Kartoffeln bereits geschält ; ich werde sie waschen und über das Feuer hängen. Sie ging , von Anna begleitet , nach dem Brunnen und in das Häuschen.

Article: Spanien. nern van San⸗Sebastion kundzugeben u. den Telegraph nach Madrid zwei Tage lang für sich mit VBeschlag zu belegen. Blanco begab sich selbst nach Orio, besprach sich mit den Parlametairen, und wartete nach deren Weggehen sehnsüchtig auf die Ankunft der beiden earlistischen Bataillone, zu deren glänzendem Empfang alles bereit war. Die Truppen pflegten der Ruhe und freuten sich auf das Verbrüderungsfest und die Bewohner von San⸗Sebastian waren in hellen Haufen ausgerückt, um diesem Schauspiele beizuwohnen. Mittlerweile verging der Tag, aber die beiden carlistischen Bataillone ließen sich nicht sehen. In beiden Lagern wurde die Retraite geblasen und geschlagen, und als dieselbe auf carlistischer Seite geendet hatte, der Tag, u. mit ihm der Waffenstillstand vorüber war, fingen die carlistischen Vorposten an, ein recht munteres Gewehrfeuer auf die höchst verdutzten Alfonsisten zu beginnen. Blanco war gefoppt; denn die beiden carlistische Bataillone, weit entfernt überzugehen, hatten nur Waffenstillstand begehrt, um die ihnen gänzlich ausgegangene Munition zu ergänzen. Wären sie an diesem Tage ernstlich angegriffen worden, so hätten sie sich nicht vertheidigen vermocht. General Egana, welcher natürlich die von den Alfonsisten verlassenen Positionen Orio⸗Uzurbil sofort besetzt hat, lehnt sich jetzt mit seinen linken Flügel bei Orio an das Meer, steht mit seinem Centrum in den starken Pasitionen von Armieta und Andoain, und dehnt seinen rechten Flügel bis Oyarzun aus. Seine Batterieen zu St. Esteban und auf dem San⸗Marev sind, wenn gehörig mit schwerem Geschütz versehen, im Stande, San⸗Sebastian zu beschießen. Vermuthlich wird jedoch Egana zuerst versuchen, sich der Orte Hernani, Astigarraga u. Renteria zu bemächtigen, ehe er etwas Ernstliches gegen San⸗Sebastian unternimmt. Perula, mit seiner geheimnißvollen Division, wird wohl zur Hand sein, wenn es gilt. (K. 3.) Madrid, 25. Mai. Die neuesten Nachrichten lanten sehr günstig für die Carlisten; sie bestätigen sämmtlich die Räumung der starken Positionen von Uzurbil und Orio durch die alfonsistischen Truppen. Die Carlisten haben diese Stellungen sofort besetzt und den Feind bis unter die Mauern von St. Sebastian verfolgt. Die betreffende officiell, Depesche hat folgenden Wortlaut: „Jgueldo 23. Mai, Abend. Brigade General Aizpurrua an den General Mogrovejo. Der Feind zieht sich eiligst zurück, unsere Truppen verfolgen ihn von Mendizonoz her. Nach hartnäckigem Widerstande nahmen wir alle befestigten Punkte des Platzes. Genauere Nachrichten folgen.“ Selbst die „Agence Havas“ mu den Kückzuz der Alfonsisten zugeben. Sie meldet aus St. Sebastian: „Die Armee fährt fort, sich bei St. Sebastian zu concentriren (Sehr gut!). Die Brigade Infanzon hat Zudugarray und Orio verlassen u. nach Zerstörung der Brücke von Orio und der Befestigungen von Mendizonoz sich auf Jgueldo zurüdkgezogen. Von Rentaria nichs Neues; die Carlisten setzen ihre Arbeiten in der Umgebung dieser Stadt fort und fahren schwere Artillerie in Urcabe auf.“ Die Alfonsisten müssen nun gleichfalls zugeben, daß die Föderalisten sich wieder rühren. Wenigstens schickt das alfonsistische Correspondenzbureau die folgende Depesche in die Welt: „Föderalistische Banden durchstreifen die Gegend um Gerona. Sieben derselben haben die Waffen niedergelegt, vier wurden gefangen genommen und zwar Anführer sind ins carlistische Lager übergetreten.“ (K. V.) Bayou ne, 22. Mai. Der Commanbant der lllfonsistischen Norbarmee, General Que- Zaba,' ber währenb seiner Commanboführung noch weniger gethan als sein Vorgänger, hat auf Befehl bes Kriegsministers Iovellar bas Commabo biefer Armee an ben General Loma einstweilen übergeben müssen, unb ist nach Mabrib gerufen toorben. Vermuthlich foll er sich bafelbst wegen ber am 30. April unb 7. Mai an ber oberen ,Arga erlittenen bebeutenben Schlappen, sowie wegen sonstiger Las« He^en-bie den Earlisten zu Gute gekommen sinb, rechtfertigen. Er ist am 30. im Mai in Mabrib eingetroffen, unb hat als&gt;balb 'eine sehr erbitterte Befchwerbeüber feine, Wie er meint, unzeitige mnb ungerechtfertigte Abberufung bei bem Gesammtministerium geführt, Wie aus guter Quelle verlautet, foll Cuesoba ben Oberbefehl über bie Norbarmee nicht wieber erhalten, aber auch Loma nicht definitiv bantit betraut werben. Das Kriegs- Ministerium zu Madrid scheint in nicht gelinger Verlegenheit darüber zu sein, wem ber Oberbefehl übertragen werben könnte. Morio- Nes, vielleicht bie geeignetste Perfönlichteit, lebt in offener Feinbfeligkett mit Iovellar, und wirb bas Commanbo nicht erhalten, selbst wenn Alfonso es wünschen sollte. Loma, der provisorische Oberbefehlshaber ber alfonststifchen Nord-Armee, hat, vor feinem Abgänge nach Navarra, ben 19. b.

P. Piaristen größtentheils mit Auszeichnung abgelegt; 4. In der Abtheilung für die militärische Laufbahn sind Zöglinge sowohl für k. k. Kadeten-Jnftitute als Militär-Akademien zur Aufnahme genügend vorbereitet worden; 5. Aus der Abtheilung für Zöglinge aus dem Gewerbs- und Handelsstande wurden zwei Eleven gleich für das,Geschäft vorbereitet und daselbst ange nommen; die andern übergingen in höhere Handels-Akademien des Jn- und Auslandes; 6. In Folge erlangter hoher Bewilligung der löblichen Direktion des k. k. po lytechnischenInstitutes haben im frühern Schuljahre 5 junge Männer die Ma turitätsprüfung aus allen Gegenständen des Vvrbereitungsjahres zum Behufe des Eintrittes in die Technik zur Zufriedenheit abgelegt.; 'S. Im allgemeinen Vorbereitungsjahre haben 4 Jünglinge nicht deutscher Zunge aus der heiligen Religion, deutscher Sprache, Methesis, Physik, Geographie und Geschichte Beweise theils guter, theils vorzüglicher Kenntnisse gegeben. K, In der französischen, italienischen, englischen, ungarischen, serbischen und neugriechischen Sprache, im Zeichnen, Musik, Gesang, Tanz und Gymnastik haben die meisten Eleven den an sie gestellten Forderungen entsprochen. In sittlicher Beziehung ist, Gott sei Dank, kein Fall vorgekommen, der prnstere Maßregeln oder Besorgnisse hätte in Aussicht stellen laffen. In Betreff der Disziplin und der gehörigen Verwendung des Rekrea- tionsgeldes mußte nur zweimal (im ganzen Jahre und bei 60 Eleven) energisch auf Befolgung der Hausgesetze gedrungen werden, und der Erfolg war beide Wale für die Eleven segenbringend und dann auch den P.

Denn sowie ohne wahrhafte Hingebung an die religiösen Vorschriften kein ISSll-r sittlicher, so ohne nachhaltigen Gehorsam im Hause kein pädagogischer Erfolg: Beides aber mutz Hand in Hand gehen.

Ich kehre zu meiner Anfangsfrage zurück, ob es im deutschen Mittelalter Mysterienspiele gab, und möchte nun wie folgt antworten: Dem Namen nach gab es
sie nicht, aber dem Inhalt nach offenbar schon. Der Opfertod Christi und seine
Präsenz in dem vom Priester verwandelten Sakrament: das waren die Mysterien des Christentums schlechthin, und die Figuren des Geistlichen Spiels waren
dazu da, diese Mysterien plastisch und physisch erfahrbar zu machen, nicht nur
intellektuell, sondern auch spirituell. Mit anderen Worten: Es ging bei der Rezeption figürlich konzipierter Spiele nicht so sehr um Didaxe oder moralische Lehre,
sondern um die Aneignung einer exegetischen Rezeptionshaltung, die es auch
Laien ermöglichen sollte, die irdischen Zeichen und Ereignisse der Heilsgeschichte richtig zu deuten und durch sie hindurch die Mysterien des katholischen Kults
‚realiter‘ zu erfahren.
 Ob man heutzutage beim Wort ‚Mysterienspiel‘ auch an den Ablass denkt?
Wohl kaum: moderne Formen des Theaters, auch wenn sie mittelalterlichen Spielen nachempfunden sind, erheben keinerlei Anspruch auf eine unmittelbare Heilswirksamkeit, eine rituelle „efficacy“ im Sinne der Performanztheorie Richard
Schech­ners.53 Dennoch gibt es keinen vergleichbaren Begriff, der die grundsätzliche Alterität des mittelalterlichen geistlichen Spiels so prägnant auf den Punkt
bringt.54 Solberg weist auf namhafte mediävistische Spielforscher wie Karl Young
hin, die die Semantik von mystery play „instruktiv“ gefunden haben, auch wenn
sie den Begriff für eine moderne Wortschöpfung hielten.55 Ein besonders instruktives Beispiel für die modernen Konnotationen des Wortes im Deutschen ist jedenfalls Goethes Faust, für dessen Interpretation das Mysterienspiel immer wieder
bemüht wird. So wie Eduard Devrient an der Etablierung von ‚Mysterienspiel‘ als
Lexem beteiligt war, so hat sein Sohn Otto Devrient als Regisseur am Weimarer
Hoftheater zwölf Stunden lang über zwei Spieltage im Mai 1876 die beiden Teile
von Faust auf einer dreistöckigen „Mysterienbühne“ inszeniert, auf der Himmel
und Hölle das irdische Treiben Fausts umrahmten. Zwar betonen die Herausgeber
des Faust-Handbuchs, dass Devrients Bezugnahme auf das mittelalterliche Mysterienspiel „historisch unzutreffend“ war, aber seine Inszenierung, die erste Gesamtaufführung von Faust I–II in seinen beiden Teilen überhaupt, fand dennoch große
Beachtung in der Presse und wurde vielerorts nachgeahmt.56 Außerdem konnte
Devrient auf die Struktur von Goethes Tragödie als Begründung für seine Büh53 Vgl. Schechners Situierung des Geistlichen Spiels beim Wirksamkeit-Pol seines „Wirksamkeit-Unterhaltung-Geflechts“: „From Ritual to Theater and Back: The Efficacy-Entertainment
Braid“ in: Richard Schechner: Performance Theory. 2. Aufl. London, New York 2003, S. 112–169,
hier S. 133f. Im Ablass wird die Heilswirksamkeit des Geistlichen Spiels besonders greifbar.

nengestaltung hinweisen: So wie Arnoul Gréban Le Mystère de la Passion mit dem
„Paradiesprozess“ eröffnete, hat Goethe seinem Spiel einen „Prolog im Himmel“
vorangestellt. Diese Rahmenhandlung, das unablässige Bemühen von Mephistopheles, Faust auf ewig für die Hölle zu gewinnen, gilt heute immer noch als besonders mysterienspielhafter Zug und wird u. a. auch in Lehrmaterialien für den
Schulunterricht hervorgehoben.57 Der Begriff kann also nicht nur eine besondere
Nutzung des Spielraums in (meist phantasievoller) Anlehnung an die mittelalterliche Simultanbühne implizieren, sondern vor allem eine religiöse oder ethische
Sinngebung des Bühnengeschehens, die das irdische Handeln des Menschen in
Bezug zu himmlischen und – bei Bedarf – auch höllischen Mächten setzt.
 Bei seinen Faust-Inszenierungen führte Otto Devrient allerdings eine professionelle Schauspieltruppe an. Heute sind es vor allem Laiendarsteller, die sich
das Wort ‚Mysterienspiel‘ zu eigen gemacht haben, und zwar als Teil eines gemeinschaftlichen Theaterschaffens, das durchaus Ähnlichkeiten zum Theaterbetrieb des Mittelalters aufweist. Wie Darwin Smith jüngst am Beispiel des Mystère
de Trois Doms (1509) aus Romans gezeigt hat, war die Theaterpraxis, aus der die
Mystères entstanden, ein kollektiver Prozess, an dem zahlreiche Spielschaffende
beteiligt waren.58 Dies betraf nicht nur die materielle Bewerkstelligung der Aufführung (Kostüme, Requisiten, szenischer Apparat), sondern gerade die fast einjährige Erarbeitung des endgültigen Spieltextes, für den das Theaterkollektiv als
Ganzes (mit obrigkeitlicher Beteiligung) verantwortlich zeichnete. Nach einem
ersten Entwurf durch den ursprünglichen Spielautor erfuhr der Text mindestens
zwei durchgreifende Neubearbeitungen, um Verbesserungen und kreative Einfälle aus den Proben aufzunehmen sowie Emendationen durch die mit der Zensur
des Spiels beauftragten Kommissare des Stadtrats zu berücksichtigen, die alle in
sukzessiven Reinschriften des Gesamttextes und revidierten Rollenauszügen für
die Darsteller festgehalten wurden. Für ihre Mühen wurden die Schreiber entlohnt – es sind gerade die Spielrechnungen, die Auskunft über ihre Arbeit geben
– doch die Darsteller in Romans mussten wohl, wie andernorts belegt,59 die Kosten
für ihre Kostüme selber tragen. Durch das eigene Rollenspiel haben Laien ihre
Zugehörigkeit zur Sakralgemeinschaft des Wohnorts unter Beweis gestellt und
den gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhalt innerhalb anderer am Spiel teilnehmenden
Institutionen der städtischen Gemeinschaft gestärkt, etwa der Zünfte und Spielbruderschaften, die die Verantwortung und unter Umständen auch die Kosten

für Teile der Aufführung trugen.60 Über das Mysterienspiel eröffneten sich für die
Bewohner eines Ortes Formen der Partizipation am Kult der Kirche, die bei der
Messe nicht möglich waren.
 Diese Tradition wird heute durch die Festspiele einiger katholischer Mysterienspielvereine gepflegt, oft unter bewusster Anknüpfung an örtliche Frömmigkeitstraditionen. Dies gilt für die anfangs erwähnten „Lüfthildis-Mysterienspiele
e. V.“ aus Lüftelberg (Meckenheim) sowie die seit 2001 stattfindenden Kleinenberger Mysterienspiele aus Kleinenberg, einem Stadtteil von Lichtenau in NordrheinWestfalen. Beide Orte sind von alters her Wallfahrtsorte: Lüftelberg ist nach der
Heiligen Lüfthildis benannt, die um 900 gelebt haben soll und in der örtlichen
Pfarrkirche St. Petrus begraben ist,61 während Kleinenberg in der Wallfahrtskirche Mariä Heimsuchung ein wohl um 1400 entstandenes wundertätiges Gnadenbild behütet, Maria, Helferin vom Kleinen Berg.62 Ausgesprochenes Ziel von beiden
Gruppen ist die Stärkung der örtlichen Wallfahrtstradition zur Ehre der jeweiligen Ortsheiligen. Die Kleinenberger Aufführungen z. B. finden immer Anfang
Juli zum Fest Mariä Heimsuchung statt, dem Patronatsfest der barocken Wallfahrtskirche, während die Lüftelberger Spiele immer in der Fronleichnamsoktav
aufgeführt werden.63 Zwar mag es bei diesem geistlichen Laientheater bescheidener zugehen als bei den Passionsspielen in Oberammergau, aber man hat es auch
nicht nötig, den Ansprüchen von internationalen Gästen zu genügen: Die Aufführungen sind für ein regionales Publikum gedacht und werden regelmäßig von
einigen Hundert Zuschauern im Rhein-Sieg-Kreis und im Hochstift Paderborn als
fester Bestandteil des liturgischen Kalenders neben anderen Festen des Kirchenjahres angenommen. Wie beim Geistlichen Spiel treten Publikum und Darsteller
gleichermaßen als Gemeinde zusammen. Auch wenn hier die Kulturanthropologie von Edith und Victor Turner nicht voll zutrifft, leisten die Spiele dennoch

örtlichen Fronleichnamsprozession aufkamen, wurden die Kosten der Figuren in Zerbst offenbar durch Ablasseinkünfte gedeckt. Dorothea Freise: Geistliche Spiele in der Stadt des

einen Beitrag zur religiösen communitas des Ortes: Sie ebnen Rangunterschiede ein
und stärken die sozialen Beziehungen unter den Beteiligten.64
Unter ‚Mysterienspiel‘ versteht man also in diesem Kontext nicht nur alt-neue
al­ternative Bühnenformen oder eine religiöse Sinngebung des betreffenden
Büh­nenstücks, sondern eine besondere Art des Theaterspielens, die nicht nur
Rol­lenspiel ist, sondern auch Ausdruck der eigenen Spiritualität, eine gelebte
Fröm­migkeit, die man über das Spiel mit Gleichgesinnten teilt. Gerade der „Lüft­
hil­dis-Mysterienspiele e. V.“, ein eingetragener Verein mit eigener Satzung,65 ist
eine „freiwillige Vereinigung“ im Sinne der Soziologie:
ein freiwilliger Zusammenschluss um ein gruppengeistig bestimmtes Anliegen,
der einen persönlichen Kontakt unter den Mitgliedern voraussetzt und sich […]
durch regelmäßige Veranstaltungen eine eigene Lebensform gegeben hat.66

Beachtenswert in unserem Kontext ist, dass das neben den Aufführungen stattfindende Lüftelberger Vereinsleben sich durchaus mit den geselligen Aktivitäten
und Funktionen einer spätmittelalterlichen Spielbruderschaft vergleichen lässt,
u. a. in der Gedächtnispflege verstorbener Mitglieder.67 Ihren Inhalten nach las64 „Es gibt keine Grüppchen, ganz unabhängig vom Alter bilden wir eine Gemeinschaft und

sen sich die Spiele darüber hinaus im engeren Sinne als Mystères bezeichnen:
Unter den wechselnden Titeln der inzwischen 49 Aufführungen – in besonderen
Jubiläumsjahren wurden 2–3 Spiele dargeboten – begegnen immer wieder Heiligenvitae, nicht nur die von Lüfthildis, sondern beispielsweise auch von Elisabeth
von Thüringen, Franz von Assisi, Hildegard von Bingen, Bernhard von Clairvaux,
Teresa von Avila, Nikolaus von Flüe und Bruno von Köln. Sind die Heiligenspiele
des deutschen Mittelalters nur spärlich belegt: Hier entsteht ein ganzes Textcorpus theatraler Hagiographie.68 Es ist dies zumindest eine weit authentischere, sich
selbst genügende Form des zeitgenössischen religiösen Theaters als die jüngeren,
zu Sensationalismus und Missionierung neigenden Spielinitiativen fundamentalevangelischer Kreise in den USA, denen die Passionsgeschichte Christi als bevorzugter Spielstoff dient.69
Auf der anderen Seite: Dass dem mittelalterlichen Geistlichen Spiel Sensationalismus und Missionierung fremd geblieben wären, kann man auch nicht behaupten.70 Und auch das Laientheater dient zuweilen, mal explizit, mal implizit,
gewissen politischen und gesellschaftlichen Zielen, selbst wenn es um Brauchtum
und Traditionspflege geht.71 Es dürfte zumindest klar geworden sein, dass die Gattung des Mysterienspiels heute ein überaus vitales Nachleben genießt: Ein Begriff,
der im deutschen Mittelalter so nie existierte und erst in der Neuzeit aus dem
Französischen entlehnt wurde, wird seit dem 19. Jahrhundert neuen Bedeutungen
zugeführt, in denen populäre, aber auch professionelle Vorstellungen des mittelalterlichen Theaters greifbar werden. Er dient nicht nur zur Charakterisierung von
Goethes Faust als Teil des deutschen Kulturerbes, sondern wird mit Vorliebe für
Formen des Theaters herangezogen, die sich bewusst von der modernen kommerziellen Theaterpraxis abgrenzen.
 68 Vgl. „Stücke“, URL: http://mysterienspiele.de/?page_id=6 (10.06.2019). Die Lüftelberger stehen
hier auch in guter Tradition: Bereits zu Anfang des 17. Jahrhunderts dienten die Vitae von Niklaus von Flüe und Bruno von Köln als Grundlage für gegenreformatorische Spiele, einmal
beim Sarner Bruderklausenspiel von 1601, und wieder bei dem 1602 vollendeten Cenodoxus von
Jakob Bidermann, dem Paradebeispiel des jesuitischen Theaters schlechthin, das die Ereignisse hinter der Gründung des Karthäuserordens durch Bruno auf die Bühne bringt. Vgl. Das

Inwiefern heutige Mysterienspiele, von gläubigen Katholiken aufgeführt, nicht
nur ethische Vorbilder durch dramatisch dargebotene Heiligenleben bereitstellen,
sondern auch die gleichen Mysterien zur Veranschaulichung bringen, die in den
dramatischen figurae des deutschsprachigen Geistlichen Spiels augenscheinlich
werden sollten, lässt sich im Rahmen dieses Beitrags nicht sagen. Bei den 6. Kleinenberger Mysterienspielen, deren Aufführung ursprünglich im Juli 2020 stattfin­
den sollte, auf Grund der herrschenden Coronavirus-Pandemie jedoch auf den 2.
 und 3. Juli 2021 verlegt wurde, ist die Integrierung des dortigen Marienspiels zur
Zeit in einen größeren Komplex kultischer Hand­lungen anlässlich des Fests Mariä Heimsuchung angekündigt: eine abendliche Lich­terprozession am Vorabend
des Festes, zwei Festhochämter in oder vor der Wall­fahrtskirche, eine eucharistische Prozession mit Kreuzwegandachten auf dem Wallfahrtsgelände und eine abschließende Marienfeier vor dem Hochaltar der Wallfahrtskirche, in dessen Mitte
das wundertätige Bild der „auxiliatrix de monte“ steht.72 Im Kontext der jüngeren
mediävistischen Spielforschung, die das mittelalterliche Schauspiel in der Spannung zwischen Ritual und Theater untersucht und Etappen einer allmählichen
Herausbildung eines säkularen, ästhetisch genossenen Theaterbetriebs ohne rituelle Ansprüche näher zu bestimmen sucht, lässt sich zumindest festhalten, dass
das Geistliche Spiel, hier als neuzeitliches Mysterienspiel, sich auch in den Kult
neu einbinden lässt.73

Praktiken des Verbergens und Offenbarens
in mittelalterlichen ‚Geheimschriften‘ – und wie sie im Kontext
von Herrschaft und Mystik benutzt werden

1 Das Projekt und seine Ergebnisse
Die Grundlage der folgenden Überlegungen ist ein abgeschlossenes DFG-Projekt,1
dessen Ergebnisse derzeit für die Publikation vorbereitet werden. Es ging in dem
Projekt um eine Sammlung und Analyse von geheimschriftlichen Glossen und
Texten des Mittelalters in deutscher Sprache. Als Untersuchungszeitraum ergab
sich dabei die Zeit von 800 bis 1500. Davor war nichts zu finden, danach ändert
sich die geheimschriftliche Praxis enorm und wird so elaboriert, dass wir als Philologen die Segel streichen mussten. Zeugnisse der früheren Zeit jedoch konnten
wir so gut wie alle entschlüsseln – und das nicht mit Hilfe des Computers, sondern
einfach mit etwas Phantasie, ein wenig Zeit und viel Kaffee. Das allein schon ist
ein Ergebnis des Projekts: Als sichere Form der Geheimhaltung von Sprachinhalten sind die meisten Zeugnisse nicht anzusehen. ‚Geheimschrift‘ im Sinne einer
effektiven Methode, Schriftinhalte vor ungewollten Zugriffen zu schützen, – so
könnte man den Befund pointieren – ist für die Verschlüsselungspraktiken und
die erfundenen Alphabete des Mittelalters eine anachronistische Bezeichnung,
vor allem, wenn es sich um nichtdiplomatische Geheimschriften handelt.2 Der
Grund dafür ist allein schon das Fehlen der kommunikationssoziologischen Voraussetzungen. Schrift ist gerade im früheren Mittelalter kein Verbreitungsmedium, das unkontrolliert zirkuliert. Auf das Medium der Schrift haben nur Wenige
Zugriff, und Schrift ist gebunden an feste institutionelle Zusammenhänge. Für die
Meisten war Schrift an sich also schon ein Geheimnis, ein arcanum, und wenn man
etwas schriftlich Fixiertes geheim halten wollte, dann ging das am einfachsten
durch die Geheimhaltung des Schriftträgers, der vor dem Buchdruck ja jeweils ein
einzigartiger war. Aus einer anderen Perspektive lässt sich dieser Befund durch

deutscher Sprache sind uns aus dem Untersuchungszeitraum nicht bekannt geworden.

einen Blick auf die Gegenwart verdeutlichen: Im Internet kursierende Daten, die
irgendwie vertraulich sein sollen, müssen alle aufwändig verschlüsselt werden,
denn jeder kann potentiell zu jeder Zeit und von jedem Ort darauf zugreifen. Die
Kryptographie ist deshalb ein notwendiger und immer wichtiger werdender Teil
der Informatik; Datensicherheit ist ein absolut notwendiger Aufwand, den die Verfügbarkeit von Daten mit sich bringt. Kurz: Je unkontrollierter Daten zirkulieren,
desto größer ist die Notwendigkeit ihrer Geheimhaltung. Dieser Befund erklärt,
warum ‚geheimschriftliche‘ Codes im Mittelalter vergleichsweise einfach sind. Es
handelt sich um Praktiken des Ersetzens und Vertauschens oder um erfundene
Alphabete, die simpel zu encodieren sind, da etwa die Häufigkeitsverteilung der
verwendeten Buchstaben nicht berührt wird. Darüber hinaus beschränkt man sich
auf wenige Techniken und gibt den Handschriften oft ihre eigenen Schlüssel bei.3
Wenn es also nicht um Geheimhaltung geht, worum dann? Eine ebenso phantasie- wie funktionslose Erklärung ist, dass es sich um ‚Spielerei‘ handle. Aber das
ist nicht nur zu einfach, sondern greift auch zu kurz und erklärt nichts. Ferner
würde sich dann auch die Frage stellen, wie man den Begriff des ‚Spiels‘ angemes­
sen historisieren kann. Ich will, als Ergebnis des Projekts, dafür argumentieren,
dass es sich bei den ‚Geheimschriften‘ um eine besondere Form der Schrift han­delt,
die den Rezeptionsvorgang medial beeinflusst. Diese recht allgemeine Grund­an­
nahme kann sich in vielfältigen pragmatischen Funktionen realisieren, wie der
Un­terscheidung zwischen Text und Paratext oder der Markierung der geheim­
schrift­lichen Einträge, die sich – so unsere Projekterfahrung – optisch von der umgebenden Schrift absetzt, also den Eintrag mehr hervorhebt denn verbirgt. Durch
die Verschlüsselung ergibt sich aber auch so etwas wie ein ‚Lesewiderstand‘, der
zwar nicht dazu führt, dass man den Text gar nicht, aber doch nicht auf den ersten Blick lesen kann. Auch das kann rein pragmatische Funktionen haben, etwa
dass man im Schulunterricht zwischen den Zeilen stehende Glossen nicht sofort
ent­z iffern können soll. Doch die Veränderung der Lektürepraxis durch den ‚Lesewiderstand‘ kann auch eine weiterführende Bedeutung freisetzen. Der Text wird
nicht einfach gelesen, sondern ‚offenbart‘ sich in der Form des langsamen, kon­
zen­trierten Entschlüsselns – so einfach dieses auch sein mag. So wird nicht nur
ver­hindert, dass ein Text versehentlich gelesen wird, sondern die fremde Form der
Buch­staben stattet – so meine These – den Text mit einer Bedeutungsdimension
aus, die über den reinen Wortsinn hinausgeht.  3		 Vgl. dazu ausführlicher Stephan Müller: Warum mittelalterliche Geheimschriften keine Ge­
heimschriften sind – am Beispiel des Trierer Teufelsspruches (Trier Stadtbibliothek Hs. 564/
806 8°). In: Schriftträger – Textträger. Zur materiellen Präsenz des Geschriebenen in frühen

2 Die Schrift der Herrscher
Gregor von Tours berichtet über den merowingischen König Chilperich I. (um
535–584), dass er das lateinische Alphabet erweitert habe.4 Die Forschung hat diesen Buchstaben schon früh große Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt.5 Genauer heißt es
bei Gregor:
Er fügte auch unserem Alphabet einige Buchstaben hinzu, nämlich ω, wie es
die Griechen haben, ae, the, wi wofür die Schriftzeichen folgende sind: [hier
folgt die Abbildung der Zeichen] und sandte Schreiben in alle Städte seines
Reichs, daß die Knaben so unterrichtet und die alten Büchern mit Bimsstein
radiert und umgeschrieben werden sollten.6

Es kommt nun nicht darauf an, ob diese Geschichte so stattgefunden hat oder welche Funktionen diese Erfindung gehabt haben sollte. Sicher haben wir es nämlich
mit einer Herrscheranekdote zu tun, in der die Wichtigkeit des Chilperich betont
wird und die Tatsache, dass er mit der Modifikation der lateinischen Schrift in der
Merowingerzeit für die Integration einer fremden Kulturtechnik in seine Herrschaft steht. Die Forschung hat die Geschichte in der Tradition der Claudiusvita
des Sueton gesehen (cap. 41,3), in der es heißt, dass Claudius das lateinische Alphabet durch drei Buchstaben erweitert habe und dabei auf griechische Buchstaben, die er kannte, zurückgriff. Dagegen wurde zu Recht eingewandt, dass Sueton im frühen Mittelalter nicht verbreitet und kaum bekannt war. Besser sollte
man wohl von einer etablierten Topik ausgehen, die sich dann auch bei Isidor
von Sevilla greifen lässt, der unter den Schrifterfindern auch Herrscher wie die
ägyptische Königin Isis oder Kadmos nennt (Etymologiae I,3). Schrifterfindung erscheint hier als Herrschaftsgestus, als eine Form, über die Welt zu verfügen. In
den meisten Fällen werden wir es dabei mit ‚Behauptungen‘ zu tun haben, wie ein
kurioses Beispiel zeigt, das durch die Handbücher geistert: Das Alphabet Karls
des Großen, von dem etwa Herbert W. Franke7 oder Friedrich L. Bauer8 berichten.
 Dabei handelt es sich um eine reine Erfindung des Johannes Trithemius in seiner
Schrift Polygraphia, die 1508 vollendet und Kaiser Maximilian überreicht, aber erst
1518 gedruckt wurde. Dort heißt es: „Constat autem teste Otfrido Carolum propria plura excogitasse alphabeta, quibus per latissimum regnum secure uteretur in
archanis cum singulis praefectis“. („Es steht aber, wie Otfrid bezeugt, fest, dass
sich Karl mehrere eigene Alphabete ausgedacht hatte, die er im Gebiet seines sehr
ausgedehnten Reiches sicher für geheime Kommunikation mit einzelnen Grafen

benutzte“).9 Trithemius fügt dem noch eine Abbildung hinzu und als Faksimile
dieser Form findet es sich in den genannten modernen Darstellungen – und nicht
nur in diesen. Aber allein die Behauptung des Trithemius zeigt, wie lebendig der
Topos vom Herrscher als Schrifterfinder noch in der Frühen Neuzeit war. Und in
diesem Kontext haben wir dann tatsächlich weitere Schrifterfindungen von Herrschern vor uns, wobei die Habsburger eine dominante Rolle spielen.
 Kaiser Friedrich III. bezeichnet sich im Codex 2674 der Österreichischen Na­tio­
nal­bibliothek in Wien, also in seinem berühmten Notizbuch, in dem sich mehre­re
Ver­­schlüs­selungssysteme und fremde Alphabete finden, selbst als Erfinder ­einer
Ge­­heim­schrift (Abb. 1). Unter einem Schlüssel steht dort nämlich am unteren
Rand des Blattes: „hab ich selbs gedacht“.
Ob das zutrifft, ist nicht zu klären, jedenfalls handelt es sich um einen originellen Schlüssel: In der unteren Zeile steht ein Alphabet mit 23 Buchstaben, also ohne
j, u und w. Dem Alphabet folgen Zeichen für et, us und (t)ur, was darauf hindeutet,
dass mit dem Alphabet (zumindest auch) Latein geschrieben werden sollte. Über
dieser Zeile stehen nun die Zeichen, die statt der Klarschrift geschrieben werden
sollen. Die ersten vier Vokale werden vertauscht: a = e, e = a, i = o und o = i. Das
v-Zeichen ist davon nicht betroffen. Die Konsonanten (und dabei auch das v) werden dann in Zweierpaaren kreuzweise vertauscht, wobei die Vokale ausgelassen
werden: b = c, c = b, d = f, f = d, etc. Da die Buchstabenzahl ungerade ist, werden auch
die drei Zusatzzeichen in das Spiel mit einbezogen: z = et, et = z, us = (t)ur, (t)ur = us.
„Friedrich“ würde nach diesem System also als „Dsoafsobg“ geschrieben.
 Auch in den Gedenkbüchern Kaiser Maximilians finden sich solche Versuche, die
sehr wahrscheinlich von Trithemius inspiriert wurden, der immerhin am 8. Juni
1508 seine Polygraphia (u. a. mit dem Alphabet Karls des Großen) dem Kaiser überreichte.10 Diese Versuche Maximilians stehen technisch gesehen auf der Schwelle
zur Neuzeit. Dabei kann als sicher gelten, dass diese Geheimschrift über die im
Mittelalter üblichen Techniken des einfachen Ersetzens und/oder Vertauschens
hinausgeht, sodass die bis dahin gewohnten Encodierungsversuche, die etwa auf
den Prinzipien der Häufigkeitsverteilung von Buchstaben beruhen, nicht funktionieren. Ein Beispiel für dieses noch nicht systematisch untersuchte Phänomen
ist etwa der Codex 2900 der Österreichischen Nationalbibliothek Wien. Dieses
Gedenkbuch Kaiser Maximilians stammt von der Hand des Marx Treitzsaurwein,
wurde also in direktem Kontakt zu Maximilian geschrieben – und das auf mehreren Blättern in einer Geheimschrift.11

ten am Ende des 14. Jahrhunderts über Rudolf den Stifter berichtet, sticht besonders die Erfindung dieser Geheimschrift hervor: „Wan er machte new figuren und
půchstaben, die vormals nie chain auge het gesehen; mit den schraib er seinen
gehaimen seine grosse und haimleich sache, so si nicht bey im waren.“ („Denn er
fertigte neue Schriftzeichen und Buchstaben an, die zuvor kein Auge je gesehen
hatte. Mit diesen schrieb er seinen Vertrauten – wenn sie nicht bei ihm waren –
wichtige und geheime Sachen“).13 Die Chronik schreibt der Schrift also eine di­plo­
ma­tische Funktion zu. In dieser Funktion ist allerdings nichts erhalten. Tat­säch­lich
sind uns aus dem Umkreis Rudolfs mindestens drei Zeugnisse der Ge­heim­schrift
über­liefert, die einen anderen Zweck gehabt haben müssen.14 Es handelt sich dabei um eine Grabinschrift, die heute in das Bischofstor des Wiener Stephansdoms
ein­gelassen ist, um ein Gebet, das wie ein Ornament eine Urkunde umrahmt, und
um die fragmentarische Inschrift auf einem Sigel, die allerdings so weit zerstört
ist, dass eine Deutung kaum möglich ist.
1772 wurde in der Taphographia Principum Austriae eine Auflösung des Alphabets und des Epitaphs abgedruckt,15 doch diese Auflösung, die in der Ausgabe fast
wie die Lösung eines Kriminalfalls gefeiert wird, war eigentlich überflüssig, denn
Petrus Apianus und Bartholomaeus Amantius hatten sie bereits 1534 ver­öf­fent­
licht,16 auch wenn ihnen kleinere Lesefehler dabei unterliefen (Abb. 2).
 Sie lesen „Hic est Sepultus dominus dux Rudolfus fundator“, wobei das „DENS“,
das als „dominus dux“ gelesen wird, jedoch gar kein e enthält. Inzwischen versteht
man das eher als „de nobili stirpe“, also „aus edlem Geschlecht“; wenn auch da­für
keine Sicherheit besteht.17 Wichtig für den vorliegenden Zusammenhang ist, dass
der Abdruck bei Apianus und Amantius wie selbstverständlich geschieht, eine
‚Geheimschrift‘ also wurde die Schrift erst durch das Vergessen der Neuzeit. Im
16. Jahrhundert war sie keine und das nicht nur bei Apianus und Amantius, denn
es sind zahlreiche Zeugnisse einer Entschlüsselung des Alphabets bekannt, wobei
keine Rudolf als Erfinder nennt, aber auch keine vor die Zeit Rudolfs zu datieren

 ist.18 Wie wenig es um Geheimhaltung geht und welche Aura der Schrift zukommt,
zeigt – um nur ein Beispiel zu nennen – die Verwendung der Schrift auf dem Hofer
Altar des Hanns Pleydenwurff von 1465 als Teil der dreisprachigen Kreuzinschrift,
wo die Rudolf-Schrift die griechischen Schriftzeichen ersetzt und damit öffentlich
encodiert werden kann, denn man weiß ja, was auf der Kreuzinschrift steht.19
Ein weiteres Zeugnis ist eine Urkunde vom 4. Juni 1360,20 mit der Rudolf dem Ste­
p­hans­dom die Reliquien des hl. Trophinus, der hl. Sophia, des heiligen Papstes und
Mär­tyrers Urban sowie des heiligen Soldaten und Märtyrers Theodor überlässt.
Diese Urkunde bestätigt Rudolf selbst mit der Unterschrift: „Wir der vorgenant
Her­zog Ruodolf sterken disen prief mit dir underschrift unser selbs hant“. Diese
Ur­kunde ist ornamenthaft umrahmt mit einem Gebetstext in der Geheimschrift
Ru­dolfs, mit der das Reliquiengeschenk als Opfergabe bezeichnet wird, für das
die Tröstung Gottes für den Herrscher und seine Familie samt seiner Ge­schwister
eingefordert wird.21 Eine non-invasive Röntgenfluoreszenzuntersuchung der Urkunde hat ergeben, dass die Tinte der Geheimschrift mit jener der le­gitimierenden
Unterschrift Rudolfs identisch ist. Sie stammt also von der Hand Rudolfs und ist

damit eine Körperspur des Herrschers. Die Urkunde wurde und wird im Kontext
des Stephansdoms aufbewahrt, also jenes Kirchenbaus, den Rudolf intensiv betrieb
und der auch Ort seiner Grablege – und so auch der Ort für das geheimschriftliche
Epitaph – werden sollte. Auch das berühmte Individualportrait Rudolfs des Stifters
gehört zu diesem Komplex der medialen Gegenwärtigkeit des Herrschers.22
Der Herrscher macht sich in seiner Schrift präsent. Auch wenn unsicher bleiben muss, ob die Schrift seine eigene Erfindung war (die Überlieferungslage falsifiziert das jedenfalls nicht). Der Herrscher legt Hand an, ist in der Schrift der Urkunde spurhaft präsent, wie auch im Portrait und im Epitaph, das ihn im Kontext
seines Grabmals also nochmals sehr konkret körperlich anwesend macht. Das geheim zu halten, wäre geradezu kontraproduktiv. Produktiv ist in diesem Konzept
aber die Bindung von Zeichenkörper an den Körper des Herrschers insofern, als
man mit ihm in direkten Kontakt kommt, wenn man die Schrift entschlüsselt oder
sie sich entschlüsseln lässt (im Kontext des Stephansdoms war die Anwesenheit
von Personen, die diese Schrift lesen konnten, sicher gewährleistet). In der Performanz der Entschlüsselung setzt man sich mit der ‚Erfindung‘ des Herrschers
auseinander und der Effekt ist eine besondere und besonders intensive Form der
Memoria. In der singulären Relation von Zeichen und Zeichenerfinder performiert man aber auch eine Innovationsbehauptung. Mittelalterliche Memoria und
humanistische Herrscherweisheit greifen ineinander.
Es geht dabei um eine ganz spezifische Weltaneignung und Geltungsansprüche
durch die Herrscher, die über die Relation von Signifikat und Signifikant hinaus
dort eingreifen, wo man sonst nur Außenstehender ist: Sie verfügen über den Code.
 3 Die Schrift der Mystik
Wie bringt man das mystische Erlebnis einer unmittelbaren göttlichen Offenbarung in die vermittelte Form der Schrift? Das – um es einmal ganz abstrakt zu
formulieren – mussten sich die Mystikerinnen und Mystiker des Mittelalters fragen. Dass diese Frage eine brisante war, zeigen uns jene Schreib- und Schriftkonstellationen der Mystik, die als komplexe Antwortentwürfe auf diese Frage gelesen
werden können. Es sind Antwortentwürfe, die man als Prophylaxe gegen Hä­re­sie­
vorwürfe lesen kann, aber auch als eine komplexe Form der Plausibilisierung und
Legitimierung des Unerhörten. Dieses weite Feld eines mystischen Schrift­dis­kur­
ses ist für die vorliegende Argumentation immer dann interessant, wenn Schrift
und Schriftkörper selbst Gegenstand der Reflexion werden. Diese Reflexion setzt
wie die Schrifterfindungen der Herrscher auf der Ebene des Codes an und kann
– wie zu zeigen sein wird – auch Formen von ‚Geheimschriften‘ hervorbringen.
Caroline Emmelius hat diese Problematik grundsätzlich herausgearbeitet und
am Beispiel The Book of Margery Kempe vorgestellt.23 Dort wird erzählt, dass die

Mystikerin in ihren Visionen aufgefordert wurde, dieselben aufschreiben zu lassen. Nach 20 Jahren – um 1433 – veranlasst sie das auf einen weiteren göttlichen
Auftrag hin, doch der Schreiber stirbt bei der Arbeit. Ein ‚Überarbeiter‘ und Fortsetzer kann die Schrift des Vorgängers jedoch nicht lesen und verstehen, weder die
Sprache noch die Buchstaben („lettyr“) seien irgendwie bekannt. Trotzdem versucht sich der Schreiber an dem Text, gibt aber nach vier Jahren auf und empfiehlt
einen anderen Schreiber, der mit dem ersten Schreiber bekannt war und vielleicht
deshalb mit der Sprache und Schrift zurechtkommen könne. Als auch dieser dritte
Schreiber scheitert, versucht sich der zweite Schreiber nochmals und kommt voran. Doch bei der Arbeit schwindet seine Sehkraft. Erst als ihm Margery erklärt,
dass dahinter der Teufel stecke, der die Reinschrift vereiteln möchte, arbeitet er
weiter, bis endlich das Buch in einer lesbaren Form vorliegt. Einfach aufschreiben
lässt sich die mystische Offenbarung nicht! Über dieses Beispiel hinaus will ich
nur folgende Fälle nennen: Margarethe Ebner, die über ihren Schreibprozess berichtet, dass er „zunächst wider Willen und mit ‚forht und schrekken‘ […] im Ad­
vent begonnen hat“24, und der nur mit Unterstützung einer vertrauten Schwester
statt­finden konnte, die einen ihrer Träume aufzeichnet, womit Offenbarungssi­
tua­tion und Schreibsituation getrennt werden. Aber Margarethe Ebner schreibt
auch selbst, und ihr Schreiben ist dann, wie Peters zusammenfasst, „Movens der
Re­ka­pitulation […] und zugleich verstärkendes Medium der Begnadung“.25 Die
Offen­barung widerstrebt dabei ganz grundsätzlich einem sukzessiven Bericht.
 Mar­garethe Ebner betont, „daz ich ainz kum vor dem andern gescriben moht“.26
Adel­heid Langmann schreibt erst nach dem Schreibbefehl eines Dominikaners,
der ihre Texte prüfte „und vant daz, daz ez allez gereht was und sterket sie dor
an“.27 Überhaupt sind Schreiber, die für Mystikerinnen arbeiten, nicht selten, und
in Christine Ebners Offenbarungen sprechen solche Instanzen auch in der IchForm im Text; teils mit Namen versehen, teils als anonymer „frund“.28 Das gilt nicht
nur für Mystikerinnen. Die Geschichte der Verschriftlichung von Seuses Vita steht
dafür. Seuse selbst wollte die Schrift nicht in Umlauf bringen und verbrennen, aber
die Dominikanerin Elsbeth Stagel sorgte für den Erhalt des Textes der Vita.29
Bei diesen Beispielen handelt es sich kaum um solche realen Schrifterhal­tungs­
geschichten wie jene von Max Brod und Franz Kafka. Gearbeitet wird hier an der
eingangs genannten Frage, die man noch abstrakter formulieren kann: Wie kann
eine mediale Form für die Kodifikation der Erfahrung des Gött­lichen überhaupt
aussehen? Die vor­liegenden Geschichten zeigen, dass man dabei an die etablierVor­­stellungen und Praktiken des Öffentlichen und Privaten in Mittelalter und Früher Neuzeit. Hg. von ders. u. a. Göttingen 2004, S. 47–65.

Wirklich benutzt wurden weder die neue Sprache noch die Schrift. Der ein­zi­ge
Textzeuge, in dem die litterae igno­tae aktiv verwendet werden, ist die Zwie­faltener
Briefhandschrift (Abb. 4). Dort wird ein Brief eingeleitet mit: „Hil­­digardis . xuiuild.
monachis“, also „Hil­­degard an die Mönche von Zwiefalten“.
 Die Anwendung der lingua ignota findet sich in einer Antiphon der Hil­de­gard,
die ebenfalls im Zwiefaltener Brief­codex überliefert ist (Abb. 5):
O orzchis (Glosse: imensa) ecclesia armis divinis precincta
et iacincto ornata
tu es caldemia (Glosse: aroma) stigmatum loifolum (Glosse: populorum)
et urbs scientiarum
ó, ó, tu es etiam cr[i]rzanta (Glosse: uncta)
in alto sono
et es chorzta (Glosse: chorusca) gemma.33

Damit fand die lingua immerhin im selben Codex wie die litterae Anwendung, wo­
bei sich die Wörter der Antiphon mit nur einer Ausnahme („loifolum“ für „po­
pulorum“) nicht in den überlieferten Fassungen der lingua ignota finden. Dort
wird „loiffol“ als „populus“ (in B zusätzlich als „liut“, „Leute“ übersetzt), was auch
zeigt, dass Hildegard die Wörter ihrer lingua flektiert, hier also den Genitiv Plural
verwendete. Die in B und R nicht enthaltenen Wörter könnten darauf hinweisen,
dass weitere, umfangreichere Glossare verloren sind, oder auch, dass Hildegard
solche Wörter spontan erdachte und die überlieferten Glossare eine sekundäre
Sammlung darstellen. Die Antiphon ist dann auch noch in R (fol. 405va, ohne Neumen und fol. 466rab, hier mit Neumen) und in der Handschrift Wien, Österr. Nationalbibl., Cod. 963 (fol. 156ra, ohne Neumen) überliefert. Ursprünglich aber ist sie
wohl als Anhang zu dem Brief an die Zwiefaltener Schwestern gedacht gewesen,
der der Antiphon vorangeht.34
Christel Meier hat dieses Projekt der Heiligen Hildegard jüngst vorbildlich dokumentiert und bewertet. Sie stellt es in den Kontext der Verwendung des Griechischen und Hebräischen in lateinischer geistlicher Lyrik und stellt eine Verbindung zum Problem der „adamitische[n] oder angelische[n] Sprache“ – also zur
Sprache des ersten Menschen und zur Sprache der Engel – her.35 Die lingua und
die litterae sind jedoch ein Projekt, das keine breitere Verwendung fand, wie die
wenigen Zeugnisse dokumentieren. Doch das Projekt steht auch im Kontext des

Heinrich Schipperges. Gerlingen 1995, S. 126f.: „O Kirche, unermeßlich weit, umgürtet mit

In offiziellen Kreisen ist man allgemein der Ueberzcugung, daß das Ende, soweit es die Vertheidigung von Paris betrifft, un mittelbar bevorsteht. Die Imperialisten sind thätig, und die englische Regierung begünstigt, wie man weiß, die Restauration der napoleonischen Dynastie unter einer Regentschaft.

Am Mittwoch Abend fand in »der mit Flaggen und Festons festlich geschrnücktcn Rotunda des Capitols die feierliche Ent hüllung der Statue Abraham Lin coln'- statt. Schon lange vor der für die Feierlichkeit festgesetzten Stunde waren die Zugänge des CapitolS von einer großen Menschenmenge belagert, und als endlich, nachdem um Uhr die hohen Beamten der Republik, die Mitglieder des Senates und Repräsentan tenhauses, das diplomatische Corps und die bevorzugten eingeladenen Gäste ihre Sitze eingenommen, die Thüren geöffnet wurden, war das Gedränge ein lebhaftes. Die Statue stand auf einer in der Mitte der Rotunda errichteten Tribüne, natürlich umschleiert. Rings herum saßen der Prä sident und der Vizepräsident der Ver. Staa ten, General Sherman, die Senatoren Car penter, Trumbull und Patterson, die Reprä sentanten Banks, Brooks, Cullorn und van Wyck und die Künstlerin, aus deren Hän den die Statue hervorgegangen, Frl. Vinnie Ream. Die Enthüllungsfcierlichkeit begann um llhr, und wurde durch eine von der Ma rine Band gespielte Ouvertüre eröffnet. Danach trat" nach kurzer Eröffnungsrede Richter Davis, vorn Oberbundesgericht, auf und lüftete ehrfurchtsvoll den Schleier, der die Bildsäule des Märtyrerpräsidenten ver hüllte. Dem vorher lautlosen Schweigen folgte hierauf een. lauter und nicht enden wollender Beifallssturm. Die Statue zeigt Mr. Lincoln stehend, die Figur auf dein linken Bein ruhend, wäh rend das rechte leicht gebogen vortritt. Ein langer Mantel von moderner fällt in schönem Faltenwurs von dcr rechten Schul ter über den ausgcstreckten rechten Arm zur Erde hinab. In dcr rechten Hand hält Lincoln die Emanzipations-Proklamation. Die Magerkeit der Formen Lincoln'S ist durch das Arrangement der Draperie nicht geradezu verhohlen, aber doch so verdeckt, daß der Eindruck kein unschöner ist. Die Gesichtszüge der Statue kommen ohne Zwei fel dem Original völlig nabe. Das Haar ist sehr glücklich arrangirt. Die Festredner waren Senator Trumbull, Hon. S. M. Cullom, Hon. N. P.Eanks, Senator Patterson, Hon. James Brooks u. Senator Carpenter, welcher Letztere die Ver fertigerin der Bildsäule, Fräul. Ream, der Versammlung vorstellte.

Fritz und die Flagge! Fritz »var ein artiger Knabe, und bei Vielen wohlge litten, weil er nie widersprach, sondern Alles that, was sein Papa, der Mayor, sein Gou verneur, und sein Schwager, der Stadt- Registrar, ihm auftrugen. Dafür hatte er seine Taschen stets voll Zuckernüffen und Pennies und für letztere kaufte sich unser Fritz vor einiger Zeit eine sehr schöne Flagge. WaS hilft aber die Flagge, wenn Nie mand sie sieht? meinte unser Fritz. Wenn Paris capitulirt, ziehe ich sie auf! Die Capitulation von Paris ließ aber lange auf sich warten, ja dke Pariser wollten nichts davon wissen. Endlich aber kam doch eine Nachricht, daß die Pariser unter ge wissen Umständen sich doch zu einer Capi tulativn entschließen würden, »venu... Fritz hatte von dieser Nachricht kaum die Worte „Pariser" und „Capitulation" ge hört, als er sofort aus das Dach lief und seine schöne Flagge aufzog. Natürlich glaubten viele Leute, die Fri tzen'S Ankündigung gehört, Paris sei wirk lich gefallen, als sie aber beiin Gegenüber anfragten, hörten sie, daß dem noch nicht so wäre. Fritz aber, obwohl er bald cinsah, daß er einen „mistuke" gemacht, war trotzig u.td ließ die schöne Flagge hängen! Am ande ren Morgen hatte sie der Sturm zerrissen, und Fritz bereute bitter seine Voreiligkeit.!

AuS bis dahin unbekannten Ursachen änderte die BriAg plötzlich ihren CourS u. wandte sich direkt gegen den Dampfer, dcr, ehe er Zeit zum Wenden gehabt, in der Mitte des Schiffes getroffen wurde. Der Zusammenstoß war ein sehr heftiger und die Wand des Dampfers wurde vom Bug spriet sowohl, »vie unter der Wasserlinie von» Kiel der Brigg total eingedrückt. Nur der größten Geistesgegenwart und Ruhe der Offiziere und Mannschaft gelang es, das Schiff durch Verstopfen der Löcher mit wollenen Decken, und Umstauen des Cargo's auf die Leeseite des Dampfers das Schiff vom Untergang zu retten. Das Wasser war zeitweilig so gestiegen, daß man fürchten mußte, daß es das Feuer erreichen würde, und man entging nur mit Haaresbreite dieserCalamität, die dasSchick sal des Dampfers besiegelt haben würde. Die Ladung des Dampfers, welche zum größeren Theil aus Zucker von New Oe leans besteht, ist wahrscheinlich etwa- be schädigt worden.

Crittenden, Capt.Col lison, von Baltimore, der vom Tappahan nock.mit 3000 Bushel Welschkorn und 700 Bushel Weizen auf hier unterwegs »var, ge rieth am Samstag Abend in den an jenem Abend und den darauf folgenden Tag hin durch »vüthenden Sturm, erhielt am Sonn tag gegenüber Sbarp'S Insel einen Leck u. »nutzte iin Bar Neck, an der Mündung des Choptank Flusses Zuflucht suchen, wo er nach einer Stunde sank. Man fürchtet, daß vom Schiff, wie von dcr Ladung nichts mehr zu retten ist. Die Mannschaft flüchtete sich in die Böte und kam gestern hier an. Vom Eis zerschnitten. Die strenge Kälte der letzten Tage hat die Bai von Neuem »nit Eis bedeckt, und wcTln auch der Dampfer Maryland, dtr die Stelle des verlorenen Eisdampferö Chesapeake genom men, die Durchfahrt im Hafen offen erhält, so reicht derselbe doch nicht aus, um die ganze Bai frei zu erhalten. Dcr Dampfer Kcnt, der am Mittwoch Morgen von hier nach der Eastern Showe abging, wurde auf dem Wege fast durchge schnitten von dem scharfen Eise und mußte nach Annapolis einlaufcn. Der Darnpfer United States brachte die Paffagiere des Kent hierher zurück. Der Dampfer wird, sobald es thunlich, hierher zurückkehren, um reparirt zu wer den, und wahrscheinlich schon morgen über 8 Tage seine regelmäßigen Fahrten wieder beginnen. Plötzlicher Tod. Hr. Julius I. Duve starb vorgestern plötzlich undunerwar tet in Folge eines Gehirnschlages in seiner Wohnung in Ost Fayettestr. Dcr verstor bene war ein gebildeter und talentvoller Ge schäftsmann. Er residirte früher in PittS burg, siedelte aber zu Ende des Krieges, den er alS'Offizier in der UnionSarmce mitge macht hatte, nach Baltimore über. Nach dem er hier in einem der ersten Handlungs häuser mehrere Jahre Dertrauensstcllen be kleidet, übernahm er die General-Agentur der Wittwen und Waisen Lebensversiche ruugs Gesellschaft, für die er sehr thätig und erfolgreich bis zu seinem raschen Ende wirkte. Eine Wittwe und drei unmündige Kinder betrauern den Tod des zu früh Dahinge schlcdenen. Die Baltimör e-L Harlestoner Dampfer Compagnie hat in Folge des Unfalls, welcher dem Dampfer „Sea Gull" zugestoßen ist, den Dampfer „North Point" gemiethet, welches Boot am Sams tag Nachmittag um 3 Uhr von hier nach Charleston abfahren wird. Der beschädigte Dampfer „Sea Gull" ist gestern im Hafen von Savannah angekommen. Maskenbälle am Montag. — Am kommenden Montag »verden folgende drei große Maskenbälle gegeben werden: Der Harmonie Gesangverein hält sein diesjähriges Maskenfest in der Con cordia ab. La die Carnevalsbälle dieses Vereins schon seit längerer Zeit sich durch schönes Arrangements und Gemüthlichkeit auszeichneten, läßt sich, namentlich nach den Lorbeeren, die er sich auf seinen letzten Con zerte erworben, auf starken Besuch rechnen. Der Abwechslung halber hat das Fest Comite von dem üblichen MaSkenumzuge abgesehen, »vird den Besuchern aber dafür durch Auf führung zweier komischen Tonstücke, einer Operette und einer Festkantate für Kinder mit Chor, reichlichen und angenehmen Ersatz bieten. Der soc. dem. Turnverein fei ert mit seinem Maskenball zugleich sein Ab schiedsfest von der Turnerhalle, und wird deshalb sich eines sehr zahlreichen Besuches aller Derer erfreuen, welche in diesem schö lten Lokal so manche fröhliche Stunde ver lebt, und dasselbe liebgewonnen haben, ganz abgesehen davon, daß die Maskenbälle des Vereins von jeher, ihrer Fröhlichkeit und ihres hübschen Arrangements halber, von Jedermann gesucht waren. ' Der strebsame Thalia Verein gicbt seinen Maskenball in der Centralhalle," sei nem Stammlokal. Nach dem vorjährigen zu urtheilen, wird auch das diesjährige Fest sicher ein schönes werden. Besonderes In teresse erhält für die Besucher das Fest da durch, daß die besten Masken »nit Prämien belohnt werden. B encfiz für Hrn. Gew ecke. Hr.

Wir lenken die besondere Aufmerksamkeit unserer Leser auf die Anzeigen jenes belieb ten Heilmittels PerryDavis'Pain Killer. Es ist vor dem Publikum seit länger als Dreißig Jahren gewesen und bat wahrscheinlich eine verbreitetere und bessere Reputation als irgend eine an dere patentirte Medizin der Gegenwart. Heute sind nur wenige unbekannt mit den Vorzüglichkeiten des Pain KillerS; aber während die Einen ihn rühmen als ein Li niment, wissen sie noch sehr wenig von seiner Kraft den Schmerz zu erleichtern, wenn es innerlich genommen wird. Andere gebrau chen ihn innerlich und kennen seine Heil kräfte bei äußerlicher Anwendung eben so wenig. Wir möchten deßhalb Allen mit theilen, daß er gleichmäßig heilkräftig ist, 'gleichviel ob innerlich oder äußerlich ange wandt, und er ist heute ohne einen Neben buhler auf der langen Liste der Familien- Medizincn. Es ist genügender Beweis sei ner Eigenschaften als Muster - Medizin, wenn man »veiß, daß er in allen Weltthei len gebraucht wird, und sein Betrieb immer größer geworden ist. Kein Heilmittel findet einen so weit verbreiteten Verkauf und er zeugt so allgemeine Befriedigung. Er ist ein rein vegetabilische- Präparat, und völ lig harmlos, selbst in unerfahrenen Händen. An die Schwachen, Entkräfte ten und Erschlafften. Der Redak teur des „Boston Recorder" sagt: Wir kön nen allen Schwachen, Entkräfteten und Er schlafften mit dein größten Vertrauen der Peruvianischen Syrup, der einesehr geschätzt« Auflösung von Protoryd von Eisen ist, em pfehlen, denn »vir haben selbst dessen Wohl thaten erfahreit. Er besitzt alle Tugenden, die sein Eigenthümcr dafür beansprucht. 45 Die königliche Havana Lotte r i e. Die vielen Leute, welche nicht glauben, daß "Glück in ungleichen Nummern" wie in gleichen ist, dürfen nur ein scharfes Auge aus die Ziehungen der königlichen Havana Lotterii eabcn. Eine offizielle Liste der glücklichen Num mern, die Preise gewinnen, findet man stets in unseren Anzeigespalten. Tie Ziehungen vom 24. Mai zeigen, daß einige Personen Preise er hielten, die Einen glücklich und cockfortabel für das ganze Leben machen würden. Die Gewinne -laufen von S250 auf riv0,000 und die Person, welche den leptern zog, muß wie der "Morgen stern" oder ein ähnlicher glücklicher Planet füh len. Die Gewinne »verden von den Herren Taylor u. Eo., BanquierS, No. 16 Wall Str., in Gold gezahlt. Dieses Haus hat'einen benci denswerthen Ruf unter den BanquierS und Ge schäftsleuten unserer Stadt, und jenes Unterneh men, mit dem ihr Name verbunden ist, ist eine sichere «Garantie für deren Respektabilität. fr u W Telcgram.

Das Auszahlen der Gewinne erfolgt sogleich. Diese Lotterie wird in New-Aork von der alten und bekannten Firma Taylor u.

Festa Campanile, aus vornehmer Familie stammend, begann 1949 mit der Tätigkeit als Drehbuchschreiber für einige Werke des Neoralismo rosa, skriptete aber bald – nahezu immer im Team mit Massimo Franciosa – für Regisseure wie Mauro Bolognini, Dino Risi, Marco Ferreri oder Luchino Visconti. Er war an zahlreichen wichtigen italienischen Filmen wie Der Leopard, Trauen Sie Alfredo einen Mord zu? oder Die vier Tage von Neapel – hierfür wurde er für den Oscar nominiert – beteiligt.

1963 wandte er sich selbst der Regie zu; sein Debüt Un tentativo sentimentale ließ die Kritik ratlos zurück. Bereits sein übernächster Film, die Kostümkomödie Le voci bianche, zeigte seine Wendung zu kommerzielleren Stoffen. Bis zu seinem letzten Film inszenierte er fast ausschließlich Komödien, oft mit erotischen Themen.

Neben seinen Filmen betätigte sich Festa Campanile als Schriftsteller. Nachdem er in den 1950er Jahren – vor seiner Hinwendung zum Film – in Rom als Journalist und Literaturkritiker gewirkt hatte, erschien 1957 sein Erstling La nonna Sabella (deutsch: Großmutter Sabella), der im selben Jahr von Giovanni Risi verfilmt wurde. Ab Mitte der 1970er Jahre erschienen weitere Romane. 1984 erhielt er den Premio Campiello für Per amore, solo per amore; 1986 den Premio Bancarella für La strega innamorata.
