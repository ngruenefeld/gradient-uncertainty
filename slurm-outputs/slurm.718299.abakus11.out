You have loaded an AWQ model on CPU and have a CUDA device available, make sure to set your model on a GPU device in order to run your model.
`low_cpu_mem_usage` was None, now default to True since model is quantized.

To disable this warning, you can either:
	- Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible
	- Explicitly set the environment variable TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)

torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 3.91 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 19.71 GiB of which 3.75 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 15.93 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 15.42 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 291.52 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
